First of all I want to apologize if this has been asked before, I am new to the sub and couldn’t find any info on this matter. 

So basically, I will be going to a cottage with my friends this weekend, and psilocybin will be available to use. I am curious about microdosing in order to see if it would help with my creativity since I am an artist. 

Thing is, I have a history of mental health issues. I suffer from depression, and two years ago I was hospitalized with psychosis. That was the one and only time I experienced psychosis. At the time I was using marijuana every now and then, but have only used it again maybe 3 times since and tend to avoid it as I never enjoy the high. I am not sure if microdosing psilocybin would trigger anything or if I would be fine. Dosage wise I’m thinking 0.5 or maybe even less.

Do you think that it would be okay for me to use or should I avoid it just to be safe? I would consult with my doctor but he’s extremely anti drug so I know he would just tell me to avoid it altogether. I am also on medication for depression and an anti psychotic. 

Thank you for reading!!

I've recently started MD and I love it. Started out with 15ug, but found that 20-25ug to be my sweet spot. Maybe I'm MD under tolerance, as I did recently trip and haven't really taken the recommended 2 weeks off, but started with just 1 week away to MD. Anyways, I love the effects of MD.

My blotters are tested and I secured from a very well known/reliable/reputable vendor on the DW and seem to be very consistent and precisely dosed. I'm doing volumetric dosing.

My fiancé (female, 28, 58kg) has only tripped on truffles before and she loved the whole experience (the legal ones in Amsterdam) but she's having some PTSD/Anxiety issues (I was having more severe anxiety than her), and since it's working wonders for me, I suggested she tried it. She just took 10ug today and she's feeling not that good. She's a bit agitated, has difficulties concentrating. She describes it she feels if she just drank 3-4 shots of espresso. She only had half a shot of espresso in the morning, took both the MD and 30min later the espresso in a fasted state.

What should I suggest her next dose to be (after 3 days). Should she go lower or higher? Should she do a proper trip before she starts to MD, so she gets a feel of what to look for?

She doesn't seem to be experiencing any of the positive attributes I'm seeing. I do notice some colors to be brighter (barely noticeable, but still there). I'm able to focus and get much more productive on my 25ug doses. I do have ADHD though, so that may interfere here.

2023-06-15 05:54:47,Why all research is now focused on psilocybin and not LSD,"LSD's prolonged effect duration 10-15 hours (double that of psilocybin) makes it cost prohibitive to research as it requires two work-shifts of ""researcher cover"".

So when reserchers look at what they can afford to study, budget-wise, psilocybin always wins. 

I think this is a really pity.

2023-06-15 05:11:10,focused on yourself is a massive sign of mental illness/a route to unhappiness,"Hyper focused on yourself/how you want to control things is a massive sign of mental illness. But it's what western society has been promoting so heavily.

&#x200B;

When shrooming, I am free from my cage of nasty personalized thoughts that trap me into my world.

&#x200B;

I don't think about others normally very much. It's all about my problems and me. Am I happy or sad? What do I need to feel good? Are they listening to me? Am I right? Will I get rich? Those who aren't playing my game make me mad and I can view them as stupid.

&#x200B;

A healthy human thinks about others/the tribe. When we get sick, we self isolate to protect others, and hyper focus on ourselves so we can return back to supporting the family as soon as possible. When I'm functioning, I feel so much sadness and regret for the way I've been treating those around me. Metta/loving kindness meditation really helps realign my heart.

&#x200B;

Marijuana starts a storm of thoughts. I hate my normal thoughts because I hate my circumstances, and instead of thinking about it, I make new thoughts with a plant and everything is then based in my mind. It's a distraction from the situation at hand. I need to not smoke so I can keep my thoughts pertained and motivated by physical perspectives.

&#x200B;

I think we primitively nod our head yes and shake no due to brain systems that were overtaken by our arms/advanced hands. Think of a dog. When it doesn't want to give in (submit/say no) it turns it head side to side and tries to rip the object away. When it submits (gives in, says yes) it either exposes it neck, or dips its head down in submission.

&#x200B;

People who say no a lot (argumentative for little reason) may be suffering aggressive dog syndrome (maybe small, insecure, or raised in a way where they cant trust well/accept love). They must prove their point by trying to tug back and don't want to give in, even if they are out of place.  Lot's of barking too.

&#x200B;

People who always say yes have no backbone, and may find it hard to ""tug back"" in the right situation and show dominance. We are trained to say yes to our authorities or to expect a negative lesson. Many of our mammal traits our so prevalently ignored while people try to think we are not animals.",78,2266,13,411,0

2023-06-14 20:32:26,Please help a noob with storing fresh truffles!,"So here's the thing. I receive a large amount (about 20g) of fresh truffles, all in a single vacuum-sealed package (Mexicana). I want to microdose the truffles, but that would mean I need to open the whole 20g package.

The shelf life for opened fresh truffles is about 2 weeks. So a large portion of the truffles I receive will not be usable anymore when I microdose next times. (I would take between 0.2g to 1g per dose). That presents a problem.

My idea to store them longer is as follows: I would open the entire 20g vacuum-sealed package of fresh truffles and then grind them in a coffee grinder, for example. Then I would put all the powder into a small transparent plastic bag and vacuum-seal the bag manually by removing the air using a straw (sucking the air out). Immediately after, I would close the plastic bag tightly to prevent any air from getting in. Finally, I would put the plastic bag in the fridge. Every time I want to take a microdose, I would take the required amount from that plastic bag, vacuum-seal it the same way, and put the bag back in the fridge.

Alternatively, should I just open the whole package of fresh truffles and first ""kill"" the freshness out of them somehow, like drying, for example. Would the truffles lose their potency that way, idk.

I wouldn't say I have huge social anxiety or anything, in the sense that the idea of having to talk to people doesn't give me panic attacks. But I still don't talk much, especially in settings where I am not super comfortable/there are new people around. I would rather just listen to others talk, and even if I would like to say something, when I realize that I haven't said anything at all for the past half hour and my mind just shuts down and can't think of something to say and it's a vicious cycle. Initially I was fine with this until having been told at work that some people see me as unfriendly because I never talk, when actually I'm just inside my head so much.

2023-06-14 14:01:18,Random anxiety invasion,"So I’ve been MDing for about 9 months now. I’ve gotten away from meticulously measuring out my doses and become pretty good at eyeballing it. I use between 100-300mg a couple times a month at this point, almost prn instead of following a consistent schedule like I used to (started to build up some tolerance).

I notice that sometimes I feel my anxiety wanting to come on once the psilocybin kicks in—I can always tell it’s “arrived” because my mind becomes wonderfully silent and still (ADHD here too).
But a few times—and today in particular—it’s like my anxiety is trying to invade or prevent this peaceful mental space that’s created for me 🤔😂 the best way I can describe it is that it feels like my brain is fighting what the psilocybin is trying to offer me, like it’s afraid to “let go,” which causes the anxiety.
My body begins to feel a bit tense or ticklish, like I’m restraining energy that needs released so I need to get up and take a brisk walk or shake it off or do some other somatic exercise to release it from my meat suit. Even though I know what is happening and that I’m safe and can give language to the tension I start to feel, it still makes me uncomfortable and difficult to receive what I need or enjoy the rest of the day. ☹️

I started microdosing golden teachers Saturday just gone, I started at 0.1g and currently taking 0.14g (slow increase).

My plan was to slowly work my way up until I felt something but in truth I’ve felt my social anxiety fading since day one, it’s honestly incredible how this works.

I’m 32 and have been on beta-blockers and strong anti depressants for YEARS. I stopped taking meds around 6 months ago as I felt numb.

Small things like going out in public or being seen made me anxious as Ive kinda always hated myself. The way I look etc. incredibly insecure. 

Here I am now humming and dancing in the queue at Sainsbury’s without a care in the world.

But here comes the mountain to overcome…
My whole goal with using these amazing mushrooms has always been to subside my addictions. Mainly weed however I vape and have a sugar addiction too. One thing at a time though, one thing I’m certain of is quitting weed. I want my motivation back, I have things to do.

I wanted to speak to others who have maybe gone through the same thing or have started.
I don’t feel like microdosing would be enough to quit? Or a least the dosage I’m taking. Should I look to macrodose on a weekend? Or go full heroic and look for a factory reset? Lol

First day I took 0.35 felt only a bit happy, motivated and it made me feel not tired for half an hour. On Third Day I took a 0.65g, again happy for an hour. On Fifth Day I took 1 full gram and I felt so good for like 2-3 hours, I was really enjoying music and I didn’t feel that sensation of being tired, the one that you can feel in your eyes.

Then something happened I couldn’t store them in the fridge and they started to grow mold, I read here on reddit that everything is fine, I just need to wash them under tap water. 

However on Seventh Day I took 1.25g and not more because they have also been losing water (I bought 25g and they dehydrated to 11g in 5 days, pretty bad right? probably got scammed, anyway) I didn’t feel anything except for the fact that I was more relaxed and confident during the day. 

Today on Ninth Day I took a whole 1.75g of truffles and I didn’t feel anything at all.

2023-06-13 17:29:38,I Mircrodosed for the first time today..here's my experience for all the first timers,"Im a 33M ,5'5"",160lbs.

I microdosed today for the first time before I went to work. I woke up at 7:00 a.m. and took 100 mg cap of Mexicana right away .I didn't feel anything for the first 20 minutes then felt a bit of happiness and uplift. 

I did this along with my whole morning routine and I consumed it with a can of Rockstar Energy Drink (160mg caffiene) . I got ready for work, brushed my teeth, did Crest White Strips, showered, drove to work and felt very mild effects. I have a high tolerance with stimulants and noticed no irritability as some mentioned here. Im also not depressed or have major anxiety or any suicidal or emotional problems .  Im in a very happy place in my life and did it mainly to experiment. 

The reason for my experience is to break away from my alcohol use. Usually its social, sometimes I tend to have a few drinks throughout the week before the weekend.

I noticed while driving to work I enjoyed my spotify playlist more. I glanced at the trees in a bit of an awe. I could feel some euphoria but very mild. What made it great was that it was a sunny morning and the sun was beating on me along the drive. I remember telling myself that I wish I didn't have to go to work today because I would have loved to have gone to the park for a nice walk or enjoy the outdoors more.

I plan on doing it again maybe on the weekend with 200mg possibly even 300mg to see what its like. 

I may try again tomorrow morning. Its now about 1:30pm  EST and I believe most of the effects have worn off. I did feel a little bit lethargic 2-3hrs in but its now gone. Overall pretty good experience and feel pretty good about myself right now.",85,1660,14,320,0

I have gotten these very subtle and quick head whoozy spells, but for some reason that has happened to me when harvesting tubs (no microdoses before).  So I don't think it was from the dose.

2023-06-13 14:23:16,Advice for a depressed newbie," Hello everyone, 

I'm 25(M), and I'm kind of new in this world.

 I tried shrooms some years ago with friends, and it was overall a good experience. I was quite euphoric and I had fun with my friends. Now it's been several years since I've tried psychedelics on my own. I've been suffering from dysthymia for at least 11-12 years, and I've been having depressive episodes once in a while, accompanied by suicidal thoughts. One year and a half ago, I went through a very abrupt and rough breakup, which left me quite depressed and suicide was systematically on my mind. I still suffer from delusions and obsessive thoughts about my partner, and I started therapy with a competent counselor. From time to time I've been thinking about antidepressants, even if I'm scared shitless of adverse effects (emotional blunting, numbness, weight gain, etc.) Now, I've been reading about the possible usage of psilocybin for the treatment of depression in many articles, and I would like to go down this path. In the country I'm from, esketamine is starting to be used in some psychiatric procedures, even if we're still behind. I'd like to ask you to give me some advice about microdosing, since I'm interested in psilocybin. What routine should I follow? How often should I take it? What kind of product should I use? For what it matters, I'm 6'1 and 187lb.

I started microdosing two years ago and never get huge benefits because my sweet spot at that point was 0,5g (I know) and benefits were hit or miss. Mostly because i couldn’t afford steady microdosing at such a high volume. I started tapering down my Effexor from 225 to 37,5 which sent me to the pits of depression. It took me 18 months but I did it in bursts so way too fast I guess. I’ve been stable at 37,5 for a year now and too scared to continue. So the next step was Trazodone which is a huge block on psilocybin. I was elated to find how easy it was, I went from 50 to 10mg over two months, no withdrawal depression and I sleep okay. I didn’t microdose at all during my taper and I expected my sweet spot to be lowered dramatically, but I’ve since microdose at 0,3g and felt absolutely nothing. I’m getting incredibly frustrated. I’m now at around 1/6th of both my original doses of medication but still very resistant to psilocybin. What gives? I’ll be able to come off the Trazodone completely but the Effexor will take me at least two more years, if I ever have the guts to continue tapering and that’s a big if.",76,1282,14,244,0

I bought a bottle of 100mg pills and cut a pill into quarters. I figured 25mg of niacin would be a good start. Had my shrooms in a smoothie and then swallowed the 1/4 B3 pill with it. 

Omfg!!! Not even 15 minutes in and I started the flushing, but it was extreme and incredibly uncomfortable and scary! My chest tightened and my face tightened (took on weird appearance) and my heart started racing...I also got red and rashy pretty much everywhere. It's been almost 2 hours since and I'm just starting to feel normal ish. I took 325mg aspirin after reading that it might help my symptoms. I've eaten food since too. I probably should've had more of a meal beforehand. Apparently that can help somewhat.

Soooo, I think the Stack is not meant for me. Everything I've read about the non flush niacin says that it's basically a waste of $ to even bother with it. I know some of you are using it, but, apparently the flushing type is actually what is meant for the protocol to work its charm. I'm not sure if I want to go through that Niacin drama again frankly. I nearly had my husband take me to the ER. My face still feels weird. I'll stick to Lion's Mane and Psilocybin together. 

Has anyone had such a dramatic reaction to the FLUSH type of B3? What dose? Mine was only 25mg, so I'm guessing if I was brave/crazy enough to try this again I might be able to survive a 10mg dose.

2023-06-12 18:25:09,2C-B is THE BEST for microdosing,"TL;DR 2C-B is anti-inflammatory in microdsages, unlike shrooms or LSD, which in turn makes 2C-B potentially good for depression and other diseases and symptoms related to inflammation. Other phenethylamine psychedelics would be most likely a good choice for anti-inflammtory effects

People find a lot of subjective benefits while microdosing. But a case could be made for phenethylamines (2C-x's, NBOMe's, NBOH's, etc.), especially 2C-B.

All psychedelics have anti-inflammatory effects, which work during it's duration of effects. But potency of those anti-inflammatory effects is not mediated by how much the compound makes you trip, to put it bluntly. It is mediated through an unknown pathway of 5-HT2a receptor, a receptor responsible for the effects of psychedelics.

LSD and shrooms are not anti-inflammatory at sub-perceptual doses - actually, in the case of LSD, at certain perceptual dosages it is not a potent anti-inflammatory. 

BUT that is where 2C-B differs from them! It is the most potent anti-inflammatory psychedelic drug known[1]. So it could excert many positive effects in microdosages, as inflammation is implicated in pathology of a lot of diseases - like depression for example.

2023-06-12 18:19:24,How does a microdose/mushroom trip feel like?,"How does a microdose or even regular trip feel like?

I know many people say they dont feel anything, but i am super sensitive to recognizing mind alterations, and i am the type to reach states of extreme alteration with just small doses of weed/cbd. For that, the high is like a sort of perception that reminds me of hell, or a instant regret feeling as the perception change is simply not desirable -and i only remind myself of this after just peaking (as my sober self usually can’t remember this bad feeling in precision).

Thing is, the weed effect i hate the most is that feeling of “being high”. Like, a feeling that your consciousnesses is somewhat at a different height or dimension (going from traditionally inside the body, to feeling like its sort of on or outside the skin). It also almost feels as if the sky is somewhat touchable and this in turn causes me to go into a state of suffocating anxiety. To be more descriptive, it also makes hearing people talk on the internet seem as if they are directly talking to you, as well as give your perception a feeling as if you switched a channel in the dimension.

This anxiety feeling of “being high” also reminds me when i sometimes have a fever, ill get alice wonderland syndrome, and feel too small/big for the surroundings, even when outside. So the high ends up being a battle or endurance/lone mind space journey of ignoring that high feeling until sobriety comes or until manageable. 

Does mushrooms do this? Or is this simply a weed thing? 

And what should i expect from 10-20mg? Can anyone explain in detail the inside feeling of shrooms, from a non bodily perspective? Every time i hear trip reports it only mentions 2d descriptions such as “visuals” or “good feeling”, but never the consciousness or perceptional effect.

2023-06-11 20:59:42,Any long term LSD microdosers?,"TL DR: I just wanted to ask about any long term (1p) LSD microdosers but I ended up posting my whole story.
I am about 3 weeks in and I'm starting to notice incredible changes!

Only downsides i might worry about is I don't get tired. Like it's hard to go to bed before 2 am.
Also annoying jaw/teeth pain which seems to be common but I've cut my dosage now and the jaw pain seems to be gone..
Thinking a bit about the long term effects we don't really know much about but I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for too long and I want to feel like this forever. 

Started with Fadiman protocol but I notice my mood and performance goes way down on the 2nd day of so I'm going for day on/day off now.
Dosage: started on 10ug, cut back to 5ug and I think i might cut it down a bit more.
Using pellets. One day at work i felt it hit me too hard so I'm guessing not every pellet is exactly 10ug.

Positives:
I am more attentive, my vision is extremely sharp (and it has been blurry for about a year)
I feel like I have HDR glasses on! On sunny days the sky looks so intensely blue like air pollution doesn't exist. I see every detail especially in reflections of the water, my skin, the trees...

I had a museum dose one day (30ug)  which extended my 20 min dog walk hours. I felt a bit like I was playing Uncharted in real life.
I think that's when my vision went HDR.
Also had a 4 day break and my vision stayed like this. I would not mind if it stays like this forever cause especially in nature I feel like I'm in a Bob Ross painting.

I also notice all the positive and beautiful things/people in the world instead of focusing on the negative. 
I am more playful in my speech and in my actions.
Last few days I made cashiers smile, I went to a spa which I always wanted to do and had an hour long talk with a woman (who was reading Eckhart Tolle:)) about psychology and philosophy.
I started a new job working with customers all day. The old me would not be able to handle this.
I did have a few stressy moments, a few fight or flight moments but I managed and handled the situation.
 
I'm performing well and I am proud of myself.

I am building self confidence.

My cafeine consumption has dropped from 5+ coffees a day to 2-3. Had a big headache for a few days but that was probably the cafeine withdrawals.

I have more appetite again but I'm not sure if it's a positive effect or if my mind just wants to calm down my upset stomache.

Very long post but might give some insights.

I started microdosing about a month ago. 
I have ADHD. depression, (social)anxiety, insecurity and a bit of hypochondria. The social anxiety (only in work/school environments) is something I have since my childhood. It vanished when I started smoking weed when I was 16 but it came back years later and I notice weed enhances it x 100 now.
Even when I'm not high but just smoking in the evening makes me anxious in daily life and also give me intrusive thoughts.

Quit weed last year for about a year with some small relapses. My social work anxiety diminished but I was extremely tired and hypochondric.
Adhd problems came back like 100 times stronger.
I also had a slightly psychotic episode of a few months before I quit weed due to lack of sleep, breaking with my family for a period and making the mistake of using amphetamine(which caused the psychotic behaviour) and ketamine (a substance I had been in love with for a while, used it quite responsibly but I already had a bladder infection from the amphetamine use and used K to ease the pain (did not know I had a bladder infection, otherwise I wouldn't have made the mistake of using K then.)
Went through the worst pain of my life. 
Had to go pee all the time, only to release a few drops that felt like razor blades coming out of my dick. 

Just had a 6 month weed relapse.
I've quit again now for about a 1,5 week but smoked a bit last nights to get some sleep on these hot nights and because the lsd lasts so long. Slippery slope.
Also took a valium 1 night to get some sleep but even when using it sporadically it seems to fuck my iq and short term memory way more than weed does.

Started with psilocybin (truffles), which had an impact immediately. I started laughing about my behavior and how silly my anxious and intrusive thoughts are. Started noticing nature more (even tho I  have a big forrest like garden and go hiking all the time, I didn't notice / appreciate it anymore.)

The psilocybin made my stomache extremely upset unfortunately and it made me tired. 
One night it felt like my stomache was having a heart attack if that makes sense. 😀
I do feel the psilocybin was very helpful to change my thoughts but 1P LSD is the clear winner for me.
I also brought my tinnitus back to an extreme level.
I got tinnitus from taking Wellbutrin.

Still have a slightly upset stomache, especially when I've had a few beers. Not sure if the LSD is also causing this because there was more than a week break between the psilocybin and the LSD and I still had the upset stomache the whole week.

I also had 2 psilocybin doses again in between because the LSD didn't seem to change my mind instantly like psilo did, but the upset stomache was there again, even with lemon tek. 

That's about it. 3 therapists couldn't help me although I did get some insights from 1 who was a bit hard sometimes (but I needed that).
The others basically just listened and summed up some things I already read in self help books.
I can now actually feel and practice what the books and therapists tried to tell me..

Before I was this deep, yoga and meditation (on weed or ketamine 😀) were helping me but this md'ing thing is exceeding my expectations.

Also tried ritalin or adderall for my ADHD wich make me speedy, way more awkward and even gave me a bit of pursuit anxiety. Just like I had the day after taking a recreational dose of amphetamine.
This is a lifechanger.

I started this experiment with a skeptic mindset, but this def aint no placebo. I am living again!",30,6008,5,1130,0

I’ve had no experience with true psychedelics, but tremendous experience in spirituality through DEEP meditation. Also used to take psychostimulants (prescribed for ADHD) at night, which made focused meditative states more attainable, and sleep better with them as opposed to taking them during the day where they wear off and cause rebound by nighttime.

2023-06-11 19:46:59,Microdosing shrooms after Zoloft,"Recently I’ve had a lot of changes in my life and some of them were not too comfortable to accept. I have became little more anxious and apathy appeared in work.

Started taking shrooms once in couple days and sometimes 2-3 days in a row. The dosage is 0.2g taken in the morning. 

Most interesting thing is that I have noticed that I can trust myself more. It’s easier catching flow states and mood is boosted, overall. 

Zoloft had a good effect on my symptoms only the first 2 weeks. I have became anxious after and I decided to gradually exclude them. 

I’ll try to write the progress and more about myself every now and then. I’m open for discussion on startups, AI, Fintech and business operations. 

Has anyone yet used shrooms and how was business affected by changes in personality? Any CEO here?

My first question is around dosing. I saw a recommendation of 5μg to start so was thinking of going with that. I have a 100 μg tab and 20 ml amber vial, so 1ml would get me 5μg. Would be curious to hear any of your recommendations/processes related to dosing.

Given it's a gel, I've also seen recommendations to use a warm water bath -- start with a small volume of distilled water, add the gel tab, put the vial in a warm water bath for a few minutes, and then remove and fill the vial with remaining cool liquid. Am I missing anything? Also, I'm thinking I'd like to use vodka given it seems it might help with bacterial growth and maybe also better dissolve the gel. In which case, would I use a little bit of distilled water in the water bath stage instead of vodka? And does it matter how much vodka I add relative to the distilled water, or can I just get to a grand total of 20 ml liquid with any mix?

2023-06-11 04:31:57,Negative Side Effects? I don’t hear anyone talk about these weird things I’m experiencing…,"I’m pretty new to MDing shrooms and am having some subtle and positive effects, like being able to more neutrally notice and adjust my mental and emotional responses to things in life. 

But this post is actually about 4 negative things I’m noticing, which I can’t rationally attribute to anything other than the mushrooms. But as I’ve been reading up on here over the past couple months, I don’t see other people talk about them. So I’m wondering what the group thinks about these.

As background, I did a guided therapeutic dose of 2g about 3 months ago. And for the last 2-3 weeks have been MDing. 125mg seems to be my sweet spot. Been doing 4-5 days on, 2-3 days off.

1. My sense of time is warped. 

Sometimes my day feels like it goes on forever (kind of like when you were a kid). Other days the hours zip by and I don’t think it’s been very long, nor do I feel like I’m doing things “slow,” So it surprises me to look at the clock and see it’s hours later than I expected.

2. Flatulence. 

Sorry to be gross, but it’s true. On dose days my GI is different. I’ve heard 90% of serotonin is produced in the gut and psilocybin works on your serotonin receptors… could it be doing healing work in my gut???

3. I feel dumber and have trouble with words. 

Sometimes I struggle to think of a word and it will come to me after a few moments of intense thought. Sometimes it won’t come at all. And sometimes I literally plan to say one thing and think I’ve said it, but will hear something else come out of my mouth. I also feel just generally not as smart. Like I don’t “get” things or it takes longer than normal for stuff to click. This is really scaring me. I’ve always been sharp and “the smart one.” Feeling like my brain can’t be counted on all of a sudden for seemingly simple things is awful. Should I stop taking mushrooms? 

My theory on this side effect is this: I am an Olympic level over-thinker, over-analyzer, live in my head, and often ruminate. Perhaps the increased neuroplasticity and loosening up of my ingrained thought loops and patterns are also loosening up some of my beneficial / “smart” neural pathways too and removing connections I don’t want removed?

I know I am not describing this in a scientifically accurate way, but I hope you get my gist. I mean it’s not like we can control what parts of the brain it affects. Although, I’ve only ever heard people describe positive brain changes, not negative ones.

4. I get really tired. 

I guess this is called body load? If I’m not active when this side effect hits, I crash and take a nap. The tiredness is intense. Some days I’m fine, especially if I’m out of the house. (This is the one side effect I have seen mentioned before.)

I’m wondering if the tiredness could be because my overactive brain is getting a rest, which makes it feel heavy/want to sleep. Kinda like if you were physically going, going, going, and then finally got to stop for a moment. Your body would probably fall asleep if it were to be still because of the exhaustion of endlessly going beforehand.


Any input is appreciated, especially if you’ve experienced any of these side effects.",90,3144,14,576,0
2023-06-11 04:20:22,Mushroom Trip Tomorrow (PTSD/trauma),"Hello microdosing community. I know this isn’t a sub Reddit about macro doses but I love this community because it’s very positive and uplifting. A lot of the other shroom/psych threads are negative and toxic.

It’s 3.5 years down the road. I microdosed for 3 months total and it changed my brain and life. About 6 months into the pandemic I figured I would microdose again to adjust to the new normal but quickly realized I didn’t need to. 

My brain just got used to creating the changes I need after that initial 3 months.

I initially stopped microdosing because I wasn’t even thinking about mental health anymore, and it’s improved incrementally ever since.

At this point near daily I consider I might be too happy, or too peaceful but no I’m still motivated to work and discover new things.

I’m just unusually happy for a human being.
When you work diligently on healing your inner stuff there is great rewards.

So I went from 3 decades of treatment resistant depression, anxiety, diagnosed OCD, post concussion syndrome complete with impairment to being better than I ever was. Happy, balanced, peaceful, grateful.

My life has gotten emotionally difficult, moreso than in the past, and I’m at a loss for actions I can take to help remedy my suffering (I already exercise, eat well, meditate, etc.) and oftentimes my painful feelings keep me “stuck” in not forming new friendships, relationships, etc.

I have multiple mushrooms experiences under my belt, my most recent experience being 3 weeks ago, all macrodoses. They provide me immense relief and groundedness with myself. Because of something, perhaps a desire to be less safe and more wild, true to myself, I feel a calling to do them more often but do not want to get burned or lose the magic. Generally, I’ve done them 2x a year but recently it’s been closer 3x in the last 365 days and it seems I want it more. 

I think before I do another macro dose, I’d like to hear your opinions and also am considering trying a micro dosing regime first. With this being said, will microdosing permanently ruin the magic of a macro dose in my future? Trips feel like necessary resets to my life.

2023-06-10 05:57:32,"my healing journey - mushrooms, cannabis, kanna (long post)","Hi /r/microdosing

(trigger warning; self harm)

I have always been fascinated with microdosing and it's something I enjoyed a lot back in college (mostly for recreational purposes to enhance the effects of THC). When I had access to mushrooms, they were my favorite. Eventually I lost access to them and moved on to LSD and 1P-LSD. I found some value there too, but it always felt a bit too racey and stimulating (could have been dosing too high). I think it was great for focus and for physical activities, but it just didn't give me the same mystical introspection that psilocybin offered. Last year I decided to start MDing 1P-LSD again and by the end of the year, I had taken a few macro doses too. This co-occurred with some personal relationship issues that left me in a horribly deep depression and so I stopped it all together. I did continue using THC in various quantities, mostly just to mask my depression.

A couple of months ago, I started therapy for the first time because my depression was crippling me to the point where I was making plans to end my life. Things have slightly improved since then. My counselor and I have a really good relationship and I have been seeing her twice a week (she is well aware of my history with psychedelics). Unfortunately though, even with therapy, the suicidal thoughts and ideation have not gone away and we are both concerned about my safety. She recently diagnosed me with clinical depression although I suspect a personality disorder, BPD specifically. I've been trying to cut back on my THC usage because it seems to worsen my depression when I come down from higher doses. Now I'm basically only microdosing THC as needed along with CBD and CBN. I'm not satisfied with this as I am still very unstable and not really interested in my life anymore. I also refuse to start antidepressants or really any prescription medications for a few different reasons.

Fortunately, I now have access to mushrooms and I feel that they have come back into my life for a reason. I want to start MDing again. Now that I'm older, living on my own and working full time, I want to be more deliberate and careful about my routine. I have some mental health goals that I want to achieve and I firmly believe that psilocybin is going to play a crucial role in this journey. Here are some notes and ideas I have been brainstorming:

-I took my first mushroom microdose for the first time in many years this past Wednesday. I ate 0.2g and it may have been slightly too much as things felt pretty trippy for a couple of hours. I also felt a pretty harsh comedown towards the end of the day which was relieved with small amounts of THC, CBD and CBN. I am MDing again tomorrow, I may go down to 0.15g

-That being said, the following two days have been pretty good. Not amazing, but I do feel more involved in my life now. I know that sometimes the best effects can be felt on the non dosing days. Right now I am thinking I will dose on Wednesdays and Saturdays to start (1 day on, 2 days off, 1 day on, 3 days off)
 
-I recently discovered that I see a lot of benefits from kanna in doses around 20mg (especially when combined with THC and CBD). I actually just ordered some kanna extract and I plan on incorporating this into my regimen. I'm not sure if I should make it a daily thing or maybe just on the days where I'm not MDing? Any suggestions here would be greatly appreciated.

-While I have been weaning off THC, I feel it is something I will want to have in this journey, even if it's just a microdose. Eventually, I would really like to start using it recreationally again in higher doses, even if it's just a few times a month. For now, I would just like to know how I can incorporate it into my psilocybin routine. Maybe on non dosing days with kanna and CBD?

-While I am heavily leaning towards psilocybin, I do also have a few sheets of LSD/1P-LSD. It probably makes sense to stick with one psychedelic or the other and not alternate too much, huh? I'll probably stick with mushies for as long as I have access to them which should be indefinitely now.

-Some time down the road, I would like to work up to a macro dose of mushrooms. I have always had beautiful experiences when taking 2g+ and I think it could actually help me break out of this depression. I'm thinking once I have some more microdosing under my belt, I'll know when I'm ready for a big dose 

-I have also been considering other things as well such as lions mane and ashwagandha either on MD days or off days with the kanna. I'm wary of adding unfamiliar things though, so not so sure about these

-Regardless of my routine, I will be continuing with therapy for a long time, it has been tremendously helpful all on its own.

Overall, I really want my life back. For the past 8-9 months, I have been crying almost every day. I have cried more in the past year than I have my entire life. My productivity at work has been slipping a lot which is disheartening because I love my job. I have lost interest in nearly every aspect of my life aside from weightlifting which is basically my lifeline right now along with therapy. I want to escape from these horribly dark thoughts that plague my mind. I want to form healthy relationships, I want to make friends and be social and laugh again. I want to eventually find a loving partner. I am starting to feel hopeful again after just one microdose, but I really want to attack this full force. And I want to do it with the medicine/plants that I know work the best for me, i.e.: psilocybin mushrooms, cannabis, kanna, maybe even LSD if it comes to that point.

If anyone has suggestions for a routine, I'd love to hear your opinions or maybe even your own experiences. I know this is super long so anyone who made it this far, thank you so much for reading!",59,5819,9,1073,0
2023-06-10 05:55:25,"Microdosing made me feel amazing for a couple of weeks, but i’ve slowly gone back to where I was.","I started Microdosing LSD about 3 months ago for depression, and was honestly astounded as to how well it worked and how quickly I responded. It had me convinced I was cured for a couple weeks it was that good. I was taking maybe 15-20ugs every 3 days.

However after a month it slowly started creeping back up on me, I was having dark thoughts again, found I was impatient with people and going back to old habits. I’ve messed around with doses, took a little more, took a little less, had a tolerance break for 2 weeks, and I still feel like i’m back to where i was. It’s like I took 11 steps forward and have gone 10 steps back.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Everytime i’m on the sub it seems to be mostly new people on here trying to get as much info possible or simply explaining how much things have changed after only microdosing for a week, which makes sense as I was also just as excited when I was first starting.",97,936,19,179,0

2023-06-09 19:40:56,Microdosing 1gr Fresh Truffles,"So I just started microdosing “Sclerotia of the Mexicana truffle” at 1gr and it’s Fresh not dried. 

According to a chart on the website 1gr is just what a 100kg man should take for a microdose. 

I started today with one dose and then I’ll take 2 days off and then repeat. 

I did/do not feel anything special today. Nothing negative or positive which I will take as a win for now. 

For what I understand the positive effect will gradually come over the coming weeks. 

**My question is**: How long should I take this before I should see any kind of an effect? Like, if I take this for 2 months I should have noticed an effect right?

I only bought 6 doses which will last me 18 days which is not enough, I just didn’t wanna buy more if I would’ve had an bad experience. Which I didn’t (well at least not today). 

I’m ordering more after next dose. 

Also, microdosing continuously will cost me. So I’m thinking that maybe after a few month I’ll take a “normal” dose, take a trip. From what I understand a normal trip dose could last maybe 3-6 months which will be a cheaper alternative. 



Just wanted to share some thoughts and maybe get some feedback.

I tried microdosing (10ug) for 3 weeks due to feeling hopeless and depressed most of the time, but i think i'll stop cause the days i take the doses i feel even more sad.

I told my therapist about this and she helped me understand why: LSD is like a magnifying glass, my job and family situation is quite depressing, therefore taking the drug emphasized these emotion, i'm not feeling down cause i have some problems with myself, but because the context in which i live is miserable, and taking LSD just makes my life more miserable.

However microdosing helped a lot giving me clarity about what i can do to change this situation, how can i move from my parents and seek my path, i'm extremely grateful for that. 

I think my body gives me signals to stop microdosing for now, i realized what i had to realize, better save these tabs for better times, maybe when i'll finally move out microdosing will be helpful to give me the extra boost of confidence to manage my life.",38,1116,6,205,0

# I never felt better
Well, honestly, summer + therapy + microdosing + my practice of sexual transmutation is just making me glow...

This has been so far one of the best summers of my life.

I found i'm again able to bind DEEPLY with people around me, i feel the **NEED** to hug a friend, the need to say i love you. I don't feel forced to stay or to behave in a particular way in social interactions, everything just works smoothly and automatically, as it should be...
The last time i felt something similar to this it was in my early teen years when i went to summer camps, but now it's even better!

I was the anxious guy who would always live in his head, not saying anything and having the fear of being judged, not feeling attached to people, especially new ones. I had troubles concentrating, keeping focus and **before i started this road i was depressed, anxious and suicidal daily**, i smoked a lot of weed and did occasional use of benzos.

Now I can dance, i can flirt, i can play my guitar in front of 30 people, i can laugh, i can hug, i can make jokes.

I can accept negative emotions, i can accept rejection, embarrassment and i'm always optimist and able to start searching for new better experiences, whenever one goes bad.

I don't feel the need to drink nor to smoke, i just love the way i am right now without feeling the need of other substances.

I started to believe in myself again, at the end we are all weird beings trying to impress others, build, create, and i'm not shy anymore on showing MY TYPE OF CREATIVITY. Now i can study again, i can practice my instrument and feel a connection with it, i can read and be focused on things, i can put my own interests in front of the ones of others when it comes to my life decisions. I'm not afraid to speak my mind and to impose myself whenever it is needed.

I love to talk about my passions, i feel a real connection with them, a strong emotional, almost physical connection. People look interested when i talk about stuff i like feeling that kind of energy. At the same time i see every interaction with others a huge occasion to grow, to change, to build toghether and to go even further.

Trust me when i say i couldn't ever be here if it wasn't for microdosing. It took some time, but now i can firmly affirm it changed my life.

The sinergy it has with other activities that make you feel just good as Yoga, sexual transmutation, meditation and social interactions is incredible.

# A little change

I introduced a little change in my schedule, i used to take 2 break weeks between 3-4 weeks of active administration. Usually, i start to feel a little worse in the second week of pause, i just thougth i'd try to ditch it off and keep the pause to one week.

So now i'm doing 3 weeks on, 1 week off, let's see how this goes.

So far i'm at the start of the folllowing cycle and it doesn't really show sympthoms of tolerance buildup for now.",50,3621,8,664,0

Well I'm back with great news! I'm almost two weeks sober from alcohol and cigarettes. 



After I originally posted I had already been microdosing .2 grams for a few days. I ended up having a minor mental break down, drank myself into a stupor and cut the front pieces of my hair really short. I begged my husband to give me an ultimatum to quit drinking or I would have to go to rehab.  I spent a week tapering off alcohol at home. 



That week was filled with so many epiphanies, self loathing, and then positive self talk. I definitely attribute the mushrooms for my clarity breakthrough. At first I felt like I f*cked up because I was extremely anxious and paranoid I was seeing things and hearing things that weren't there. I was concerned I reactivated a psychosis I had a few years ago. 



But once I sat with my thoughts and slowly let the poison of alcohol diminish day by day I started checking in with my body. Really feeling my feelings. Looking around my environment and truly appreciating what a beautiful life I've been allowed to have. 



Appreciating the incredible family and dogs I have. It was eye opening to say the least. The only negative so far is my crohn's disease has come back in full swing and I'm in daily (sometimes excruciating) pain. I think I'm pretty much the only person on the planet that alcohol helped my crohns. Or at least that's what I like to think. 



In reality my intestines are probably severely damaged from the years of binge drinking and now I'm no longer numb and drunk enough to not feel the pain.



Anyways sorry this is so long, I just wanted to say thank yall for the advice, thank you to this sub and to unclebens for helping me learn how to self medicate and heal. 



It might not work for everyone but for someone like me who has a predisposition to psychosis and a hereditary mental illness, microdosing did help me get sober and see the forest for the trees.",37,2081,5,377,0

• If so, how long until I am able to sense a noticeable, marked difference?

2023-06-07 14:30:20,Great metaphor for mushroom use,"This episode of Hubermans podcast is a great exploration of psilocybin. Although focused more on large dose treatment, he has a great metaphor for using psilocybin - the wedge under the boulder.

Using this medicine creates a wedge- that represents the neuro plasticity it can invoke. However, we all still have a boulder to move. This is where our conscious intention comes in, how we’re using this plasticity, new ways of learning or looking at things, new patterns of thinking, to deal with the ‘boulder’ of issues we’re dealing with - depression, compulsive thinking, anxiety, trauma etc. 

A great listen for all of us - and I’m really looking forward to being grateful for a little wedge over the coming months to supplement the hard work i’m at a place that i have to do. Enjoy the listen all, and keep experimenting.",31,957,5,143,0

2023-06-06 19:57:33,Suggestions for better results,"I started micro dosing intermittently on mushrooms years ago, but I was not consistent with my dose or my timing.

I restarted end of April 2023 using packaged pills with 100mg of psilocybin stacked with niacin, green tea, ginger using the Fadiman method 1 day on, 2 days off.
I would dose in the morning. I also stopped my ADHD medication a few days before.
I was yawning and sleepy and not motivated for the 2 off days to the extent that it was unpleasant.
Although I was hoping to replace my ADHD medication, my productivity was below usual, and my motivation was zero. So I went back to my medication but the sleepiness never went away.
I switched to dosing at night right at bedtime. That took care of the sleepiness.

It's been a month plus, and I do feel a general better mood and surely better sleep though not consistently, but I still get rattled easily by life events and my motivation and excitement are still low.

I am thinking of switching to the Stamets method of 4 days on 3 days off. However, would appreciate any other suggestions of how to maximize the effects? Motivation, creativity, and focus are my priorities at the moment.

My Long Covid bed rid me for 5 months, I had 15-20+ symptoms per day. Every medication my doctor had me take resulted in LC flair-up. LC took so many things from me, even after 1+ year of being recovered. I can't smoke pot anymore, I can't drink caffeine, I can't eat fish. Those 3 things I use to do daily/weekly before LC and after LC they all cause my symptoms to come back.   


Combine the forced lifestyle change with bad side effects from medication during my LC stint and now I'm afraid to consume almost anything that I'm not used to consuming. I do not think LC caused the issues with medication, I think It was more anxiety, which was unrealistically high during LC.   


I haven't consumed any new medication/food in over a year, and when I do try a new food I psych myself out every time. I have had mild depression and anxiety since LC but am afraid to treat it in any way.   


I'd love to try microdosing shrooms, but I'm afraid I won't react well to taking a new chemical. However, I need to try something to help me cope with my symptoms and after some research I firmly believe Mushrooms may be thing I need to help me fully return to normal.

2023-06-06 06:11:57,First time micro dosing today whilst tapering off of Zoloft. Definitely felt something despite the meds in my system.,"DISCLAIMERS: INAD. This is all my personal experience. The same will not go for everybody. I’m just here to offer my two cents. ☮️ 

Now! Some BG: I have been on Zoloft almost two years. Over that time I graduated from the 25mg starter dose, to 50mg, 75mg, then 100mg at the most. I was put on it at one of the most terrible points in my life, and I think that my time with the medication was absolutely necessary. A few months ago is when I really felt I needed to step away from Zoloft, as all I did all day was sleep, I had no energy or creativity, and my libido totally disappeared. I wanted to ditch these negative affects and start taking more hands-on, intentional accountability for my healing, instead of just popping a pill and feeling numb from my depression yet too numb to really enjoy life. Trust me, Zoloft was great, and I’m glad I’m so compatible with it, but it robbed plenty from me as well. I’ve always had a fascination with mushrooms and am now on a mission to implement them into my life for good. 

Cut to now: it’s been a little over a month since my tapering started. I took 50mg Zoloft for the month of May + a few extra days into June. I’m now on 25mg, and have been for about a week now. 
I was having a rough mental day today, and felt very stuck and uninspired due to some other current life circumstances, and something in me said to just take a micro dose. I took a 0.14g capsule in some tea. I’m very glad I did, as I was able to shower, clean, get some work done, go do some personal shopping, etc. Wasn’t anything major but I’m very thankful for this medicine and the feelings it did bring to me. And I know 0.14 isn’t anything crazy either, but I was moreso just experimenting today. 

I definitely felt more at ease. Stress dissipated. Held more compassion and acceptance towards current circumstances. It was a beautiful day indeed. I’m also convinced it helped my headache from earlier, which I get very frequently due to stress. 

The only “strange” affect I had was I felt this sort of lump in my throat and a tad bit of a bodily intensity feeling come over me. This was short lived, though. I’m looking forward to implementing more micros into my life, and eventually get onto a schedule of some sort. 

And I’ve heard about SSRI’s stunting the affect of mushrooms, too, so I’m excited to also build up my relationship with mushrooms the further I get into my tapering journey, experimenting with dosages, and discovering what else they can do for me.",117,2494,19,463,0

2023-06-06 00:10:45,3 hours of sleep on shrooms and feeling great,"Hi there,

This past winter I was microdosing shrooms. I was pretty much a rookie. No scale and no real knowledge. I took some from friends who were taking extreme amounts 3-4 grams before their workouts. When I attempted to measure my amount… it was too small to register on the scale.

At the height, I was able to be super productive off of just 3 hours a sleep a day. I had energy for mid-day workouts  and morning workouts.

I just remember taking very very small amounts when I woke up at 6am in the morning an again at noon.

My friends moved back to NY and I lost track of how to get a hold of shrooms.

Now I have access to shrooms and I’m still getting great workout. But I can’t seem to replicate the 3 hours of sleep and full of energy.

Context: It’s 2 days on and 2 days off for a week straight. Software engineers at my old tech job use other drugs like speed to work two 24 hour days a week. It’s a Silicon Valley thing. Not safe in the long run… but it’s really how the tech world has advanced in a short amount of time. People have be creating their limitless productivity stack for long time now. I know of other ways… but I would rather keep it natural with shrooms. Best wishes!

My reason is to cut back on alcohol consumption I’ve been drinking 4-6 beers everyday for the last 5 years and I cannot stop. It has had negative effects on most aspects of my life primarily my health. I’m 45 years old.

My logic tells me to dose after work instead of drinking. Using shrooms as an actual replacement for beer. I am fine during the day I wake up go to work no problem except sometimes my health dragging me down. I usually have good days working. I’m a plumber and go into peoples homes have friendly conversations, problem solve, do my job. All good.

I can’t bear the thought of sitting at home for 5 hours bored, lonely (I’m single and live alone). Usually to tired to do anything active so I numb out with a few beers eat dinner and pass out. It’s a coping mechanism for things in my life i need to change but i cannot stop drinking everyday.

I've been reading articles and comments related to microdosing for a long time. As someone who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for years, I thought microdosing might be beneficial for me. The comments I read seemed to describe my situation exactly.

I had never tried LSD before, but yesterday and today, I took 1/16 of 200 µg LSD. I spent my day at home yesterday, so I didn't have the opportunity to observe its positive or negative effects. Today, I went to the office, and it was one of the worst days of my life.

As a regular user of Concerta, I decided not to take it today in order to better understand the effects of microdosing. I began the morning working with some attention deficit. I struggled with my work but didn't experience any major problems. However, in the afternoon, my depressive episodes started to intensify. I didn't want to communicate with people. I wanted to distance myself and rest. Thoughts of suicide were circulating in my mind (I have never planned or attempted before or today).

Eventually, I realized I couldn't stand it any longer and returned home. After getting some sleep, I began to feel slightly better. Still, I feel worse than my normal state.

What i felt was a mood lift forsure.. 
my mind wasnt clogged? Is that weird to say? It was almost ‘clean’ of all the unecessary things filling it up on a daily basis. It felt weird almost but in a good way. Weird that i didnt feel the negativity i once felt for 18 years in that one day of microdosing. 
I was able to communicate exactly what i had in my mind without cutting corners and not being able to express myself fully due to brain clog.

I took my first pill around 50 minutes ago. After maybe 10 or so minutes, it HIT. It was a little like id done some weed, the first 'peak' of sorts. I felt good about things, some things slowly started connecting... Then it kinda faded within 20 minutes or so.

2023-06-05 12:58:43,First time micro dosing yesterday,"So a few months back I got 7 grams of golden teachers and a 3.5g psilocybin chocolate bar. I dipped my toes a little with the chocolate bar and didn't feel much of anything but at the time I was still tapering off my ssri. Fast forward to yesterday morning we were getting ready to take the kids (4) to the lake and I decided that would be a good day to try the golden teachers. I took .3g cut up in some yogurt and off we went. Typically I'm almost no fun in that situation, our kids are 11, 5, 3 and 18months and to say it can be stressful is an understatement. After about an hour at the beach I realized that tension in my gut had released and I was just enjoying spending time with my kids, teaching them to swim and be more comfortable in the water. I felt almost no intoxicating effects at all but nothing got me upset or stressed. My kids and wife all noticed the boost in my mood and overall we had a really great day which is kinda hard to come by sometimes when there's 4 screaming kids lol. I'm going to try every other day this week or maybe every 3rd and see if the effects are lasting. I'll take any tips or suggestions I can get on how to keep this going long term.",33,1181,5,236,0
2023-06-05 12:11:07,Abstract; Conclusion | Is Microdosing a Placebo? | PsyArXiv Preprints | OSF: Center for Open Science [Jun 2023],"# Abstract

>Some recent research and commentary have suggested that most or all the effects reported by people who microdose psychedelics may be explained by expectations or placebo effects. Here we step through all the available evidence from dose-controlled studies that have investigated the effects of low doses of LSD and psilocybin. We suggest eight reasons why current claims that microdosing is predominately a placebo are premature and possibly wrong:  
>  
>1) there have been only a small number of controlled studies;  
>  
>2) studies have had small sample sizes;  
>  
>3) there is evidence of dose-dependent effects;  
>  
>4) studies have only investigated the effects of a small number of doses;  
>  
>5) the doses investigated may have been too small;  
>  
>6) studies have looked only at non-clinical populations;  
>  
>7) studies so far have been susceptible to selection bias; and  
>  
>8) the measured impact of expectancy is small.  
>  
>Considering the available evidence, we conclude that it is not yet possible to determine whether microdosing is a placebo.

# 4.9 Conclusion

>So, is microdosing a placebo? This is a question that seems to evoke strong opinions amongst psychedelic researchers. A microdosing sceptic will look at the results in Table 1and argue that all or most of the effects that have been reported are due to expectation and placebo effects. Ultimately, that may turn out to be correct. However, we argue that based on current data, there is not strong evidence for a placebo interpretation of the effects of microdosing. Specifically, there have only been a small number (Section 4.1) of low powered studies (Section 4.2), with methodological concerns including selection bias (Section 4.7) and problematically small doses (Section 4.5). Additionally, most research has looked only into the acute effects of microdosing in healthy populations – almost nothing is known about the sustained impacts of a course of microdoses in a controlled setting (Section 4.4), and we have no data at all on potential clinical effects (Section 4.6). These issues mean that research to date may not have been sensitive enough to detect subtle pharmacological effects of low doses. Nevertheless, even within this restricted set of data there is considerable evidence of dose-dependent changes that do suggest microdosing drug effects (Section 4.3). Finally, studies that have directly investigated the role of expectation have not found consistent evidence that participants’ beliefs are the primary driver of outcomes (Section 4.8), undermining the case for a placebo interpretation.  
>  
>Overall, in light of consistent reports of benefits from self-report studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2019; Cameron et al., 2020; Hutten et al., 2019b; Lea et al., 2020c; Polito & Stevenson, 2019; Rootman et al., 2021, 2022) and lack of clear evidence on the role placebo in controlled studies to date, further microdosing research is warranted. To definitively determine what is driving the positive effects reported by microdosers, we need well-powered, longitudinal studies across both healthy and clinical populations.

2023-06-04 23:26:16,Differences Felt Between Microdosing LSA from Morning Glory Seeds and Psilocybin in Magic Mushrooms.,"I have been eating around 8 seeds of Heavenly Blue(Ipomoea Tricolor) raw(chewed) on a emptier stomach every other day or so(every third day now) for a few weeks. Toss and wash nothing special. This was a switch from intuitively microdosing Psilocybin mushrooms off and on for the last 4 years, with the last year or so being ""ON""(0.17g my MD). A typical microdose for these seeds is said to be from 5-15, along the typical 1/10th micro amount vs normal dose with average(ime) psychedelic doses starting at 100-150 seeds. I am finding I want it more than the mushroom which is very surprising. I take doses I can JUST feel and JUST see, no semantic wars please.  
\-I notice a vibrancy much like but different than psilocybin, like if psilocybin is making you see better detail then the LSA is really just a shift in saturation. The closer I look at things on Psilocybin, that higher definition look to textures is still present, while upon closer inspection on LSA things just look more ""normal"" within that vibrancy if that makes any sense at all.   
\-I feel a psychedelic energy like Psilocybin but it has less DEEP elation, less cosmic laughter or chuckles. Body feeling is like a pleasant rolling feeling, more chemical than Psilocybin but still pleasant.    
\-Instead of ""wow, this is life how amazing to be here"" it feels like "" yup what a trip were all here, now what?"", a kinda of ""moving on..."" ""and??.."" to things, a sense of urgency or alertness I don't notice with Psilocybin.   
\-I notice longer after effects, this is a huge one. The vibrancy seems to stick on days off more, no trails but a definite boost in saturation day to day. This is likely why I am wanting them dramatically less than Psilocybin, intuitively through experience my body is telling me to slow down with these, that there is higher chances of HPPD or other lingering effects if used every day. With Psilocybin I wake up the same on even light doses, with LSA there is a definite ""afterglow"" to microdoses not like Psilocybin.  
\-No ""backwards thought processes"" as I explain them on psilocybin. On Psilocybin I notice I will ""rethink"" something and become very satisfied with this new way of doing or thinking of something. This usually entails just skipping-combining steps, rearranging orders of things and then amazement when it ends up in the same place/thing. No new amazing insights or the feelings of epiphany!(I have a theory on the reasoning for this feeling on psilocybin). More of a ""This is it"" feeling similar to LSD, being DEEEP in the moment, an almost stillness.  
\-slight upset stomach first hour from toxicity of seeds which passes. Compared to mushrooms this is a major downside. It wont make you throw up but you will notice a swimmy head and upset stomach for a good 15-20 minutes.  
\-Onset is longer but not enough to mention given the low effects. A ""change over"" visually happens that is more noticeable than Psilocybin but nothing major. Again the vibrancy is noticeable on microdoses.   
\-Ability to concentrate is good but a bit scattered at times, although you are brought back instantly there is a daydream like ability at all times to fall out of what is going on. I arrive in a little pleasant spot, like a place within yourself(Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich) almost in a dissociative way. Maybe this is the lower level sedative effects of the seeds playing out on a fractal micro scale? idk. Not bad but present.  
\-I feel slightly less creative but more constructive with the seeds, there is a push to completion just to complete things, to then move on. Ideas become ""old news"" quickly, crafts or art becomes boring a bit quicker it seems.  


They feel like they lack the same ""magic"" of magic mushrooms but have something else the mushrooms are lacking, a kind physical quality that makes them workable in some way I cant put my finger on. Opposite in the way mushrooms feel almost symbiotic, an extension of ourselves unlocked with their use, the LSA feels more like an actual tool. The seeds to me are like a Gaian Pocket Calculator, best way I can describe it. It feel like something you can work WITH as YOU.   


The feelings-insight!-visual, easy digestion and lack of lingering effects in small doses make Psilocybin the usual winner in most areas, but there is something magical about the feeling on LSA that tells me keep eating them. Another thing is the desire to tell others about it, that this seed is available at any garden center for under $3 per pack and would supply you with 5-10 microdoses. It really amazes me few talk about it.   


Hope to share more in the future, really hope others chime in with their experiences with LSA in lower amounts like this! Thanks for reading I appreciate you being here for me!",100,4761,14,826,0

2023-06-04 13:51:19,My plans for micro dosing K. Asking for feedback/tips,"Hello all,


I am about to embark on a self administered Ketamine therapy and I wanted to run my approach by the group to get feedback and tips. I'd like to know that I'm on the right path.

A little back story. I suffer from depression and anxiety. I tried Effexor before which was awful and I quickly abandoned. I have also micro dosed LSD and taken LSD recreationally. Recreationally was effective (of course), while micro dosing didn't do much for me. I haven't done K in years after going into a bad K hole at a club and swearing it off. But after hearing the positive effects macrodosing it can bring, I would like to try again.

Where I live, ketamine is only available with private insurance and too costly, so I will be purchasing it in powder form from a reliable contact and administering it myself (snorting). In my research, I've gleaned that the ratio, for a sub-perceptual dose,  should be up to 0.2 mg for every kg. I weight roughly 64kg, so my maximin dose then would be 12.8 mg, but will start smaller for my initial dose. I intend to dose every 5 days or at least once a week.

So how does this sound, Redditers? I'm fine with not feeling immediate results and allowing this treatment to work over time. In other words, I don't wanna trip and certainly am not looking to go into a K hole. Are my doses too little? Too much? And is the amount of time I'm taking in between doses too long? Too short?

Happy to read all your feedback. Thanks very much!",53,1469,9,274,0

Today I felt super motivated but then after a few hours I felt tired and foggy. It was like I could feel more.

Now I'm just curious, because the anxiety is kicking my ass lately, should I still start MD'ing before then? Will it affect the hero dose in any way? Or might I build up a tolerance thereby lessening the hopefully positive effects of a hero dose? Also is there any specific strain anyone would suggest for anxiety specifically?

2023-06-03 12:51:47,"First Microdose, felt great, but woke up drenched in sweat hours later","Hey all,

My buddy and I recently ordered some Mr Mushies bars to try out microdosing.  Yes, I ordered from correct place, and verified the QR code. For those unfamiliar the bar is 4 grams, sectioned into 10 squares.  Assuming that makes each square .4 I tried two yesterday for the first time.   First, correct me if I’m wrong but is that is more of a macro than a micro dose no? 

Either way, I took it around 12pm, around 45 minute mark it started to kick in.  I made sure I took it on my day off, after all my adult duties were done, just in case lol.  Once it did kick in, the first hour was a bit more intense than I expected.  Not bad by any means, I was functional, but not something I’d want to be at work during.  After that initial rush, things got great.  Weather was perfect, Took my dog for a two mile walk, everything just felt good.  Afterwards ran a few more errands and it was also great.  At this point anything from work, gym, conversations, etc would be a non issue, and probably improved.

** Here’s where this was possibly my fault -my wife had made us dinner plans at 7.  I knew this might be iffy that I’d even want to eat.  But by then I did have an appetite, and ate probably more than I should have - also had a mixed drink with dinner. **

Got home around 9:30 and I was uncomfortable full, and dead tired.  Played a few games of chess and passed out.  At around 3am I woke up and my forehead was pretty damn sweaty. The ac was on, room was a good temp.  I noticed something was off so I got up, went down stairs and grabbed a bottle of water. Didn’t drink much of it, but by the time I got back upstairs it was starting to subside a little.  It took me about 30 minutes to fall back asleep.  The sweating was still there, would come and go a bit, with the covers off it helped.  After I fell back asleep I woke up this morning fine.**

So, did I cause this with my dinner/drink plans even though it was 7 hours later, did I take too much to be a macro dose? Any input is appreciated, as this is a new thing for me.

Productivity maybe?,"Edit and important note: I know this is potentially unhealthy and unsafe and I would never ever consider a microdosing regiment like with psychedelics. I was more wondering about doing that like once in a while. Definitely not super regularly. 

Hi, I was just buying a few molly pills and before buying them I bite like 1/6 of one of them to make sure they taste like mdma and they did. :D so I bought them. And now I somehow feel a very small effect of it. It's a bit stimulation with a slight touch of the nice lovely feeling (I assume these pills are crazily strong, must be 300mg+ if I can feel this tiny amount).
I have a lot of experience with microdosing LSD and Mushrooms and I have ADHD and I used to take a lot of Ritalin (prescription) and a lot of other stimulants like amphetamine and many others (self medication). I don't so that anymore, I just microdose mushrooms here and there and I like to roll on Molly like twice a year.
So now I'm wondering about that Molly. Would it be ok to microdose it here and there as a form of ADHD medicine and to improve productivity? Like kind of a substitute for amphetamine or Ritalin? 
Or is it too unhealthy and not a smart idea regarding what it does to the serotonin system?

2023-06-02 20:50:30,200 mg Amazonian Effects..,"Hi beautiful people! 

I am not sure if anyone has taken a 200 mg Amazonian but for me it doesn’t do anything 😕 I just get anxiety and jitters as well as sleepy like I yawn a lot for the come up and very very mild visuals but I don’t see a difference in my mood being elevated or an increased focus or happiness etc and I feel sad ngl. 

I decided to microdose to help my ADHD, anxiety and depression to get better and for me to have better focus, be happier and creative.

Any suggestions? Should I up my dose or change the strain? I did it for 3 days.

I still want to believe in the healing and positive effects of it and I am determined to allow it to happen but at the same time I don’t like to fake positivity or bs myself and pretend that it’s helping simply because it helps a lot of people. I dont want to lie to myself and I actually want to feel the benefits without forcing myself to believe they are working. I have taken higher doses before and most of my trips were great (2-2.5 grams).

2023-06-02 17:24:35,Do I REALLY need to taper off SNRIs before micro/macrodosing?,"Hi

I'm 40 yr old male currently on 300mg venlafaxine (Effexor) (8 months, switched over from 40mg citalopram 7 months ago) & 30mg mirtazapine (Remeron) (4 years). It is to counteract severe depression which currently hovers on border of suicidal. Also have complex PTSD. Fun. 
I need to start microdosing to help me deal with causes of depression/trauma rather than mitigating the symptoms with antidepressants. However it will be very risky tapering off the venlafaxine/mirtazapine as they are currently holding me fractionally above suicidal.
Unsure what to do. If I micro/macro dose now I’ll crank the doses to overcome receptor blocking effect of antidepressants, thereby run risk of seratonin syndrome. Whereas if I taper off I run risk of falling into ‘better off dead’ mode. Stalemate.
I’m otherwise healthy - eat v well, high physical fitness etc.
Does anyone have any experience & suggestions having tried psilocybin when on these drugs & doses?

2023-06-02 16:04:51,Microdosing for cocaine use and nonstop sensation in nasal cavity,"I recently started microdosing and I've done mushrooms many times before but I never noticed the weird sensation in my nose and nasal cavity. I've only noticed it since microdosing. I will say I've been dealing with some cocaine substance abuse and more than I'd like myself to be comfortable with. This is one of the reasons I wanted to start microdosing and it's been great. I have no desire to do more and even cut down on smoking. It didn't hit me until today that maybe the microdose is causing the sensation in my nose, I know its from the microdose but originally assumed it to just be extremity tingling sensation but it's the same areas that swell when I do too much blow. It could totally all be in my head but it's been consistent every dose and it's how I can tell my microdose is starting.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could this be related to the cocaine abuse or just a normal tingling extremities type of thing? I used to always get that tingle in my finger tips before I tripped with larger amounts and wasn't expecting any type of sensation for microdose. I'm only taking .1 but the feeling in my nose is prominent. I low key hope it's like my nose neurons firing and like growing back lol.

2023-06-02 09:12:46,Psychedelics reduce brain activity - not the other way around.,"*""Although the prevailing view has been that hallucinogens work by  activating the brain, rather than by inhibiting it as Huxley proposed,  the results of a recent imaging study are challenging these conventional  explanations.*"" Quote from [this study](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-psychedelics-expand-mind-reducing-brain-activity/)

This is no longer news, but it's a long way from being broadly recognized due to scientific reluctance. Studies have shown since 2015 that psychedelics/entheogens *reduces* brain activity. Earlier it was believed that they lit up the brain like a christmas tree, which is the knee jerk reaction to effects so monumental, rich and life changing. 

Now it turns out it's almost the complete opposite. Philosopher and computer scientist Bernardo Kastrup, who has done extensive experiments on himself with high dose psilocybin, speaks on the correlation between ""brain shut-down effects"" as seen with e.g. asphyxia/strangulation, G-force induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) in pilots, death/near death experiences AND psychedelics, and the complexity of experiences that follows from it. Kastrup points out that this makes psychedelics [the best ""death simulator""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpYdiYvL0s) we have access to (I highly recommend the video linked). 

In short: when our brains shut down, the experiences gets infinitely richer, as if the brain itself acts like a reduction valve between us and the absolute reality out there; when the brain gets out of the way, reality as it really is, flows in. 

Now a new study shows the same. What was earlier interpreted as increased brain activity, now shows that what really increases is ""noise"", not coherent activity, ref [the article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-psychedelics-expand-mind-reducing-brain-activity/) quoted in the beginning here.

My mushroom microdosing is going well, but recently I decided to take my first break for 2 weeks. I have to say, it's been way harder than anticipated. Which brings me to my question about ketamine. 

I've actually considered ketamine therapy before, but it's crazy expensive where I am. After feeling like crap mentally these past few days (only about a week into my shroom microdose break) I started thinking about microdosing ketamine. And, it just so happens we had some around. Yes, I've used it a few times recreationally, but tbh I don't really love it, and I know how bad it can be to use often and/or to use large doses. Yet, I find the few days after I have used ketamine I feel so much better mentally. I actually prefer the afterglow over the initial high. 

I'd still like to continue microdosing mushrooms (currently 100 mg dose) but I'm wondering about possibly taking a microdose of ketamine (say 5mg) once a week or so on my off days of mushrooms. Does anyone have experience doing this?

I still have A LOT of mental problems. I suffer from GAD, social and health anxiety, emetophobia, OCD, ADHD…

I did a lot of microdosing and psychedelics study and decided to grow my own mushrooms and try to MD. I first tested my batch with small trip (1g) to test how potent they are. It blew my mind how hard i tripped. 

Started my MD with 50 mg, 1 day on 2 days off. Didnt feel any major shift in how i feel. 

Then i upped the dosage to 90mg. Still the same. 

Last week i tried 150mg, 4 days on, 3 days off. Omg. For the first time in a while my mind wasnt racing, i was being productive at job. Even my coworkers asked me if anything good happened to me, cuz they noticed i am smiling and being in good mood! Major reduction at anxiety and depression. 
 
The problems comes in when i have day off MD. It seems like i am back to my old self or even a bit worse version. Very unmotivated, anxious and depressed. 

How smart or safe is it to take MD everyday? Or are moods on day off just something i need to work on and try to make it work.

2023-05-31 07:27:45,microdosing changed my life,"for background basically had a really awful childhood with severe trauma & abuse from both parents, so i’ve got a good mix of mental health issues lol. 

of course, i’ve always just accepted that i’ll always be “unwell,” that the deepest lows will always return. 

for the first few months of mding, i couldn’t tell much of a difference. if there was any change it felt insignificant. i’m no stranger to spiritual awakenings and was probably expecting one big moment instead of just many many small moments. little mini spiritual “aha moments.”

on antidepressants, i finally felt like i loved myself. but i still didn’t face my demons. i wanted deeply to feel the fear, feel the pain so that i could alchemize it into something else. i think this small seed of a desire grew into the healing journey i find myself on now. 

i still love myself — but it’s a journey. it’s complex. self-love is action. love is action. 

 i feel like i’m learning so much about myself and who i want to be and who i’m supposed to be. i simultaneously feel lost & found. i’m restless yet content. 

i know it’s not for everyone and it’s certainly not a miracle cure. i still have so much to do! but these lil guys have helped me realize, the healing is in the “doing” part, and that i am equipped with the tools to feel & heal — for real.",27,1319,4,243,0

2023-05-31 00:13:07,Does microdosing help/aid very embedded anxiety disorders,"Hi,

Bit of context: I'm very stricken with complex anxiety problems. 
My problematic anxiety is debilitating to everyday life and always has been. 
I've gone through every single treatment you can think of; ssris, snris, beta blockers, benzodiazepines, all sorts of therapy and a bunch of other things. Of course I still expose myself to anxiety inducing experiences constantly and on a daily basis in aid to get myself comfortable to situations, but I cannot ease it.

I have about 25g of GT which I grew about 9 months ago stashed away and all sealed up which I only experimented with once as a 3-4g trip.

I'm now considering attempting microdosing using this supply to aid with my anxiety.

Does microdosing psilocybin assist with anxiety disorders? If so, what sort of dosage would I be looking at?

Please provide your experiences if possible

2023-05-30 23:19:16,I fucked up and accidentally did the meme,"Decided to try microdosing. I did the initial setup a week ago, and forgot that I had it so that 1ml = 5mcg. So I went to take 10mcg, and my dumbass accidentally took 10ml thinking it was 1ml = 1mcg.

So off I go to work, blissfully unaware that I'd just dosed myself with 50ug of LSD. 

I got to work as my stomach felt unhappy, and that's when it began to hit. Everything quickly seemed unusually funny. I do a lot of math, and the math just seemed more interesting yet more frustrating than usual. The screen became hard to focus on. I began having those waves through your body that make you breathe.

It was then that I suddenly realized what the fuck I'd done wrong.

2023-05-30 02:20:48,Today was a good day,"I don’t remember the last time I’ve actually said those words after struggling for years with crippling depression. Every day was a struggle, I hated waking up. Every day I was drudging along, just looking forward to crawling into bed and closing my eyes, hoping I wouldn’t wake up. 

It’s been about a month since I started microdosing psilocybin, although consistently the last 2 weeks. 
Today just felt different for some reason. Almost like light and floaty the whole day. I’ve been trying to be more active for my mental health, walked about 7 miles and then rode my bike for 22 miles, I was cruising along, listening to music, smiling at people on the way ( this never happens). I later spend few hours with my nephews. Normally their exuberant energy is extremely draining to me and after an hour, I feel the need to withdraw. , but today we built 3d puzzles, made bead bracelets and went on a trail walk. I told them about different plants and mushrooms we saw along the way. For the first time, I really enjoyed spending time with them. 
After, I went home and made a nice healthy dinner while listening to music and singing along. I even had the energy to clean the house after. 
One thing about depression is it leaves you mentally and physically drained for no reason. I just felt like moving today and I didn’t even have caffeine which I typically heavily rely on.

I chopped up the mushrooms, put a little bit a of water and heated it for 5min. Passed it trought a strainer and then let it sit a little bit. I ate my lunch and then took the mushroom tea.

True Albino Teacher is a little bit more powerful than normal cubensis, and when you recently harvest them they are the most potent. 

For context: I have a scale but I was in a hurry and didn't saw the numbers correctly. I tought I was having a 125mg ou 150mg. Later on I remembered what I took. But still it wasn't a big difference up to 180mg, right?? NO!

It took around 1h to 2h for it to start kicking in. I had anxiety kicking in, a feeling of a upset stomach, and a cold sensation followed by a hot sensations. It was crazy. 

I am a experienced tripper, already took up to 3g-4g of dried mushrooms, so I know how to stay calm and just let go of trying to controll the experience. 

But I was baffled, I started to have some visuals, and then I remember thinking ""was that a microdose or a macrodose??"", ""did my stupid brain didn't see that I took 10x what I supposed to take?"". 

I didn't even think the tea would work to begin with. I heard about psilocybin breaking up at high heat. So yeah I was surprised. 

The most amazing thing about this experience was having the visuals. I was sure I couldn't have that type of hallucinations on a microdose. But well, we learn something everyday. 

My visual was like 30% of what you are seeing in the picture above, so yeah, not a big of a deal. But still crazy in my opinion. 

Also, I wasn't very good emotionally in this day, a lot of things happened that I won't get on details here. But yeah, after all it was all good.

2023-05-28 22:41:34,Allow microdosing’s place in your life to change over time. You may not need it in the same way forever.,"Hey all, I’m a long time follower of this community and wanted to share something I learned over many years of personal experimentation.

I’ve had times in my life where microdosing was the biggest deal ever - you could not convince me to not microdose, because it was saving my life after all! All I was doing was thinking about microdosing, sharing it with people, and really diving into the whole culture and science. 

I’ve had other times where I took it regularly, but it wasn’t nearly as important, and I took it in the background as if it was a vitamin. I would sometimes forget to take it and not think much of it. 

And now I’m living in a time where I just take it as needed, usually 2-4 times a month recently. And that’s just perfect for me. After all, i have to honor all the personal growth & healing psychedelics have given me by not needing to use them as much! 

Who knows about next year? Maybe it’ll be the perfect time to take it very regularly, following one of the popular protocols in this community. Or maybe I’ll throw my whole stash away and use a different method of healing. 

-

My point is that microdosing is highly individualized, and highly seasonal. Especially if you combine it with other methods of healing/awakening like meditation, yoga, therapy, or journaling - you shouldn’t be surprised if you don’t need microdosing in the same way anymore. 

I am personally skeptical of cases where someone takes them most days for many months or years. However I want to keep an open mind about it all. I had seasons of my life where I took large doses monthly, or other seasons where I use high amounts of THC or CBD to guide my journey, and others where I’m sober. We all just have to listen to our own body and inner voice. Don’t get stuck in a new rut! Don’t get trapped in “oh god I won’t be okay if I can’t microdose like this forever”. Spread your healing across many methods. 

Hope that’s helpful, what are you reflections?",104,1961,20,359,0
2023-05-28 22:40:34,First psilocybin microdose: Honest mistake = honestly tiring experience :),"Hello everyone.

After extensive researching, years of prepping myself mentally, and multiple Reddit posts in search of advice… I finally took my first micro dose and made an honest mistake.

For starters, I thought I was being “smart”. 
Turns out, I had the wrong scale to get the exact desired measurement. For being a newbie, I tried to play it really safe. 

The setting was an empty house where I had the whole day to myself. Very calm and peaceful, honest intentions with the desire to continue my own inner journey. I’ve been following my own spiritual journey for awhile and just started incorporating micro dosing into it.

I also have been taking suntheanine L-theanine, lions mane, flush free Niacin, and magnesium as directed.


So setting was good.
Intentions: honest and pure.
Headspace: a little anxious but also excited.
Measurement: … I was a little off.

I acquired some golden teacher strain from a reliable friend.

Ground it up as close to a fine grain as I could.
Even put into a vegan capsule and paired it with Lions mane. Chased both with coconut water after my morning breakfast.

My mistake… I accidentally measured 0.10 grams instead of 0.010. 

My mistake was that I have been hearing how 100 miligrams was considered a microdose and wanted to do 1/10th that. 

I didn’t realize my scale only measured to 0.00 grams. So I have now ordered a proper scale for my desired measurement.


So how did precisely 100mg feel for a first time? 

It honestly wasn’t bad at all.

I went into a deep meditation shortly after taking and wound up laughing at a bunch of memories of doing stupid stuff as a kid. Memories I wasn’t even aware I had. It was like as if I went into a calm, child like state of mind. It felt pretty positive. Shortly after, about two-three hours in, I fell asleep and was able to take a nap for the first time I can remember in a very long time. I didn’t feel the need to be on guard and was able to relax. It left me feeling really tired but also in a very positive mood where I couldn’t stop smiling. My partner even commented later that evening on my mood and was happy for me. She even tried to convince me to take another micro dose today, due to how happy and relaxed it left me feeling.

Little backstory:
I’m a US Army vet who has struggled with ADHD, PTSD, OCD, and some physical health conditions for years. I’ve been on and off meds since I age 7. Have been going to the VA since 2015… needless to say I have tried everything that was there to offer including more meds and “treatments” then I can count.
I’ve explained it in a prior post on this thread.


I believe the micro dose helped to bring down my defense walls a little and it left me feeling pretty exhausted afterwards. I took the micro dose yesterday and still feel pretty tired today from it. 


My question to you is:

Is it normal to feel tired? Or exhausted, especially for a first time?



I definitely will dial it down next time and have purchased the correct scale lol. So I have learned my lesson.

I just feel tired as if I just went through an intense therapy session. In a good way though.

Im trying to work through my own traumas and depersonalization derealization. I have nothing but positive and honest intentions with this. I am just learning my way through this process.

P.s. I have tried searching up clinical trials, self help, and have even tried to seek out guides with very little help. As explained in a prior post, I have been feeling a calling to try this for years now. I just so happened to finally take the leap and may have taken a bit too much.
I will dial it down much lower next time.


Hope you are all well 😊
I promise I didn’t mean to take that much but sometimes we live and learn. Either way, I do not regret at least trying it.


Again, is it normal to feel tired? Or exhausted, especially for a first time?


Thank you.",74,3875,10,713,0

Monday: 0,5g and felt better
Tuesda: 0,8g and felt better + no fever
Wednesday: 0,8g no fever
Thursday: 1g no fever
Friday: 0g + fever again
Saturday: 0g fever
Sunday: 0g fever and 39,7 °C

I stopped drinking alcohol just over a month ago and haven’t yet noticed a any improvement (I was a weekend binge drinker). I’ve been physically fit all my life and don’t smoke so I kind of feel like I’ve done everything I can to look after myself and I still feel like death every day.

and am keen to try.

I think I understand that starting dose should be 0.03. I think you need to take the dose daily but my query was what if I need to take a week’s break from dosing here and there? Would I experience unpleasant withdrawal type symptoms? I need to travel abroad for a week here and there by plane - between the UK and Europe and the US.

2023-05-27 23:28:21,Research {Microdosing}: Abstract; Conclusions and discussion | Unlocking the self: Can microdosing psychedelics make one feel more authentic? | Nordic Studies on Alcohol and Drugs (NAD) [May 2023],"# Abstract

>**Background and aim:**  In the present study, we focus on the relationship between state  authenticity – the experience of being true to oneself in a particular  moment – and microdosing – a practice that implies repeatedly ingesting  very small doses of psychedelics that do not reach the threshold for  perceptual alterations. We propose that microdosing could increase state  authenticity through influencing people's mood and the number and  satisfaction with daily activities.  
>  
>**Methods:** We used  self-assessments of state authenticity collected from 18 microdosers in  the Netherlands across the period of 1 month for a total of 192  observations.  
>  
>**Results:** We found that on the microdosing day and  the day thereafter, state authenticity was significantly higher.  Furthermore, the number of activities and the satisfaction with them  were higher on the day when participants microdosed, while the following  day only the number of activities was higher. Both the number or  activities and the satisfaction with them were positively related to  state authenticity.  
>  
>**Conclusion:** We propose that feeling and  behaving authentically could have a central role in explaining the  positive effects of microdosing on health and wellbeing that are  reported by current research.

# Conclusions and discussion

>In the present study, we set out to make explicit  and to test the relationship between state authenticity and microdosing  practice. Using self-collected data from 18 participants over 30 days  and 192 observation days, we derive the following key conclusions.  
>  
>First,  we found that on the microdosing days as well as the day after, state  authenticity was higher; this effect was almost double in strength on  the microdosing day compared to the next day. Our findings provide a  first empirical test of a relationship that was hinted at in various  qualitative studies ([Andersson & Kjellgren, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr3-14550725231175353); [Ferenstein, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr8-14550725231175353); [Grusauskaite & van Eijck, 2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr11-14550725231175353)).  Furthermore, state authenticity but not trait authenticity was also  related to an item assessing the global reported daily satisfaction  (results presented in the Supplementary file), which, taken together  with results of previous research ([Lenton, Bruder, et al., 2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr20-14550725231175353)),  emphasises the importance of this construct for the wellbeing of  individuals. The fact that we found empirical evidence for the  microdosing practice as a contributor to an increased sense of state  authenticity is a novel finding within the literature examining the  precedents of state authenticity.  
>  
>Second, by  reviewing the literature on emotions and authenticity as well as the  literature on microdosing psychedelics, we made explicit two potential  mechanisms at work: the first pointing toward the role of mood as  eliciting higher states of authenticity and the second pointing towards  the microdosing practice as providing a supporting context for  value-aligned behaviours that we translated into more daily activities  and a higher satisfaction therein. Regarding the role of mood, while we  could replicate the results by [Lenton, Slabu et al. (2013)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr22-14550725231175353),  which found state authenticity to be related to both positive and  negative mood, our results did not provide support for the role of  affect as a mediator between microdosing and state authenticity. In  fact, the magnitude of the effect of the mood variables on authenticity  turned out to be quite small in comparison to the overall effect of  microdosing, that is after accounting for microdosing days, only daily  average negative mood was linked to decreased state authenticity.  Regarding the role of microdosing for mood, our results add to the mixed  reports from previous qualitative studies, i.e., microdosing practice  has been shown in some cases to improve mood but also to increase  certain negative emotions or decrease certain positive emotions ([Anderson et al., 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr2-14550725231175353); [Johnstad, 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr15-14550725231175353); [Pop & Dinkelacker, 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr27-14550725231175353)).  Regardless of the relationship between microdosing and emotional  states, suffice it to say that we did not find evidence supporting the  idea that it constitutes a path linking microdosing to state  authenticity.  
>  
>Regarding the second mechanism  that we proposed, when examining aggregated measures of the number of  activities and of the satisfaction with them, we found that both these  measures were higher on the day when participants took a microdose,  while the following day only the number of activities was higher. When  we disaggregated these measures and we looked at particular types of  activities, we found that the satisfaction with activities that reflect  chores and work (have-to's) and activities that reflect relational  aspects as well as health- or hobby-related activities was higher on one  or the other of the 2 days when an effect of microdosing is likely to  manifest. In addition, we found that on the day when participants have  microdosed they more likely engaged in chores and/or cooking and  hobbies/reading/writing.  
>  
>These results echo findings from qualitative studies, e.g., the study by [Andersson and Kjellgren (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr3-14550725231175353),  where the authors conclude that “it was described how the urge for  unhealthy habits lessened significantly while the motivation for more  exercise, healthier food, and less habitual use of social media was  premiered. Also, users reported less procrastination and a spontaneous  impulse to clean the house, tidy drawers, pay bills, or address other  postponed or neglected tasks.” (p. 5). While not directly testing this,  our findings could reflect a supportive context created by microdosing  in the sense of increasing energy, focus and creativity, decreasing mind  wandering and increasing mindfulness and the quality of being in the  present, as reflected by previous studies ([Polito & Stevenson, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr26-14550725231175353)). Furthermore, they could also reflect the two-step process that was uncovered by [Andersson and Kjellgren (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr3-14550725231175353),  i.e., gaining insights and follow-up desire to act according to these  insights. All the above mechanisms could explain the relationships found  between microdosing practice, number and types of activities, the  reported satisfaction with activities and, ultimately, the level of  state authenticity. Since we did not directly test these mechanisms,  future research is warranted.  
>  
>Generally, our results put previous findings on state authenticity into perspective: while [Lenton, Slabu et al. (2013)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr22-14550725231175353)  argued that judgements of our own authenticity are made in the moment  using general emotional state as a heuristic, our findings imply that  improving mood may not be the only avenue to increase authenticity.  Specifically, it may be even more fruitful to be engaging in valued  habits that are “objectively” good and experiencing satisfaction with  them (i.e., a cognitive form of appraisal), rather than only feeling  good. Therefore, the memorable phrase by [Lenton, Slabu et al. (2013)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr22-14550725231175353)  “I feel good, therefore I am real” might be altered to “I do what is  important to me and I am satisfied with it, therefore I am real”.  
>  
>While  the above findings are compelling and in line with qualitative  research, we note that the full causal chain was not tested. For  example, we were not able to examine the impact of the microdosing  practice on mind wandering and absorption, or the alleged effect on  facilitating insights on what is important for individuals, their core  values. This has to do with the availability of the data and constitutes  a limitation of our study. However, it also offers a possibility for  follow-up studies that will examine the step-by-step causal chain that  we spelled out as well as other potential mechanisms at work. The  benefits of future research on this topic are evident as it will  directly contribute to the better understanding of how microdosing could  influence behaviour and by this could translate in a higher felt  authenticity, with follow-up effects on wellbeing. A second limitation  of our study is the sample size of participants. This deficiency was  compensated by the time interval across which we collected data as well  as the number of observation days. We also note that simulation analyses  have shown that even with such low sample sizes the regression  coefficients and their standard errors are only negligibly biased ([Maas & Hox, 2005](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr24-14550725231175353)). A larger sample size covering a more diverse population is certainly needed to increase the robustness of our findings.  
>  
>Another  limitation concerns the potential placebo effects that cannot be  addressed with these data. This, combined with the variability in doses  and regimens for microdosing, makes it impossible to distinguish between  genuine drug effects and placebo effects. While genuine drug effects  are undoubtedly relevant to our understanding of microdosing, our study  takes a different approach. Our study aims to capture the effects of  microdosing in a natural setting, where variations in factors, such as  dosage and regimen, are expected. This approach increases the external  validity of the results, reflecting real-world conditions in which  individuals are likely to have different practices, sensitivities to  substances and goals for microdosing.  
>  
>In  conclusion, we have found evidence that the microdosing practice was  related to higher ratings of state authenticity and that a behavioural  mechanism is most likely at work. Our study opens the door to a new line  of research as we propose that feeling and behaving authentically could  have a central role in explaining the positive effects of microdosing  on health and wellbeing that are reported by current research. In  addition, our data collection design captures the effects of a  microdosing practice in a natural setting. It embraces the inherent  variability in regimens and dosages while ensuring a common  understanding of microdosing among participants. This approach enhances  the external validity of our findings and reflects real-world  conditions. Furthermore, our study is a positive example of the use of  experience sampling methods with the use of a phone app, and an  invitation for researchers to further explore this methodology.

2023-05-27 22:09:44,Microdosing LSA from Morning Glory Seed,"I have been microdosing psilocybin fairly regularly for the last few years and recently switched to LSA via raw Morning Glory(heavenly blue, Ipomoea Tricolor) seeds. The difference is noticeable and figure it needs mentioning.

My normal micro of Psilo was around .17g, I would take this a few times a week with no fixed on or off days, at this point integration is a constant work in progress you could say. A few weeks ago I switched to LSA which I am not new with, having had my first psychedelic experience with them 20+years ago and occasionally come back to. My dose is 5-10 seeds toss and wash on an emptier stomach. I have no hard fixed amounts and go by how I am feeling and how the seeds look to me that day, not weight. I feel very little upset stomach with eating raw seeds in this amount but I do still notice them 10-20min within the first hour, very light but surprisingly still noticeable at this low amount. I get vibrancy and visual improvements much like a higher microdose of Psilocybin mushrooms, say .3g at this dose believe it or not, a feel good elation much similar to but without the occasional cosmic belly laughs Psilocybin has. No real trails with even cannabis just a vibrancy and psychedelic energy much like Psilocybin mushrooms. The benefit I have found that personally stick out in the seeds is the focus the seeds seem to give me, an assertiveness not present in the mushrooms. I do not take LSD but have, and know many use it to actively ""retrain your mind"" in a more literal sense and this is what I think I am feeling with LSA. Trying(poorly) to quantify it and it basically feels like Psilocybin dissolves and combines things(rearranges), ideas and thoughts and the Lysergics in the seeds seems to help me actually pilot my mind, if that makes any sense.

2023-05-27 15:51:30,1st week is uncomfortable,"So. I have completed my first week microdosing 100mg GT, 1 day on 2 days off. My objectives were to find some relief for my CPTSD and social anxiety. 

On my 1st dose, I felt some nausea for an hour or so. By the end of the week it wasn't too bad. 
The major side effects I've had are  nightmares and fatigue. Somehow, I am so much more tired than my usual self. I feel the urge to just sign out and nap way more often. Since I started microdosing, the dreams and the sense of intensely missing my ex when I wake up has returned. (It's a difficult breakup for me but, I was doing better before microdosing.) I wake up feeling anxious and lonely. Every morning has been like this. Now, I know that microdosing is not a magic pill and that it will bring uncomfortable things to the surface, but I do feel a bit discouraged. I go to the gym. I meditate quite often. I'm in therapy. 

On a side note, I crave being outdoors and I feel calmer when I am. I find it slightly easier to focus on a task. I crave new foods, new experiences.

I do feel like my intuitive voice is ""louder"" per se and at the same time, I can genuinely feel so much resistance within me to this very intuition. Oof. 

It's a very conflicting and uncomfortable experience, right now. It is supposed to make me feel worse before it gets better? What does it mean to work WITH it? 

Everyone seems to benefit from microdosing since day 1, I feel a bit at odds here.

2023-05-27 09:13:37,Starting microdosing to deal with major life change,"Hi all,

I’m just about to start my first ever schedule on monday- a bit of background, i recently moved to Thailand to work in psychology and found the whole experience to bring up a lot of things in my personal, social, working, and general life which i was not confronting in my old environment. This move has caused me to have a few months of more acutely severe depressive/anxious episodes, which looking back are probably symptomatic of longer term issues. For context, I’m 22, recently graduated, and definitely always been a doer rather than a feeler, which seem to have resulted in a lot of repressed feelings.  

I know that this massive life change is obviously having an impact, but still want to do extra things to have an impact on my low mood and lack of motivation. I’m definitely not starting SSRIs because i already have an issue with feeling numb and friends on them have said that this can get worse on some SSRIs. So MD it is!!! (im also getting back into running, reading, travelling, and hoping the MD might give me a push to socialise more again)

So questions: 

1. Which protocol should i follow- Stamets or Fadiman? I have all the extras for stamets that i’d like to take anyway for the brain fog from depression but any preference for either protocol?
2. Start off with 0.1 per dosing day?
3. I’m using GT as my MD but also got 1.5g of a mushroom labelled RR - id quite like to start my journey with a medium trip on sunday night. Anyone know what these are? Should 0.75 be a good experience as a newbie?

Hello everyone, I'm just about to begin my ""microdosing journey"", and I'm super excited as this is something I've wanted to do for a long time and finally have the means to do so.

I only need to ask this question. I did try to search for the answer first but I'm not great at navigating old Reddit posts.

What is a good way to store/dose/etc. your ground mushroom? I've already ground up some and currently have it in an airtight mason jar. I know some people (a lot of people) put their powder into capsules and keep them that way. At least for now, I don't want to do that. I also do not have a reliable scale - I used the ""1/4tsp = 0.5g"" method, but do not have smaller teaspoons than that. Is there an alternate method that anyone does?

TL;DR - I have 0.5g ground mushroom that I want to divide into 0.1g and store them so I can take those doses throughout the coming week(s) without needing to measure them every single time I want to take a dose. And I would prefer not to use capsules like I know a lot of people use.

I’ve always been an active person but recently went on a small vacation and was struggling with hiking and biking I used to do with ease. I started mding psilocybin 2 weeks prior to this. After that experience I decided I needed to change my habits. Since I’ve been taking it consistently, I noticed my thought patterns have changed and I don’t want to snack or overeat between meals like I used to. I realized it was mainly eating not because I was hungry but because I felt depressed and stopped caring what I looked or felt like because I thought nothing would ever change. 
Since coming back from my trip, I started walking a lot more ( between 5-7 miles a day) and riding my bike, few times a week, at least 10 miles. Plus hiking on weekends. I don’t feel exhausted anymore, like I used to after carb heavy meals and I’m down 5 lbs in 2 weeks. I have a cupboard full of snacks and have zero desire to eat them, instead I went to the store and got lots of greens, berries, protein, Greek yogurt, eggs, etc.

2023-05-25 15:02:47,Abstract; Conclusions and discussion | Unlocking the self: Can microdosing psychedelics make one feel more authentic? | Nordic Studies on Alcohol and Drugs (NAD) [May 2023],"# Abstract

>**Background and aim:**  In the present study, we focus on the relationship between state  authenticity – the experience of being true to oneself in a particular  moment – and microdosing – a practice that implies repeatedly ingesting  very small doses of psychedelics that do not reach the threshold for  perceptual alterations. We propose that microdosing could increase state  authenticity through influencing people's mood and the number and  satisfaction with daily activities.   
>  
>**Methods:** We used  self-assessments of state authenticity collected from 18 microdosers in  the Netherlands across the period of 1 month for a total of 192  observations.   
>  
>**Results:** We found that on the microdosing day and  the day thereafter, state authenticity was significantly higher.  Furthermore, the number of activities and the satisfaction with them  were higher on the day when participants microdosed, while the following  day only the number of activities was higher. Both the number or  activities and the satisfaction with them were positively related to  state authenticity.   
>  
>**Conclusion:** We propose that feeling and  behaving authentically could have a central role in explaining the  positive effects of microdosing on health and wellbeing that are  reported by current research.

# Conclusions and discussion

>In the present study, we set out to make explicit  and to test the relationship between state authenticity and microdosing  practice. Using self-collected data from 18 participants over 30 days  and 192 observation days, we derive the following key conclusions.  
>  
>First,  we found that on the microdosing days as well as the day after, state  authenticity was higher; this effect was almost double in strength on  the microdosing day compared to the next day. Our findings provide a  first empirical test of a relationship that was hinted at in various  qualitative studies ([Andersson & Kjellgren, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr3-14550725231175353); [Ferenstein, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr8-14550725231175353); [Grusauskaite & van Eijck, 2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr11-14550725231175353)).  Furthermore, state authenticity but not trait authenticity was also  related to an item assessing the global reported daily satisfaction  (results presented in the Supplementary file), which, taken together  with results of previous research ([Lenton, Bruder, et al., 2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr20-14550725231175353)),  emphasises the importance of this construct for the wellbeing of  individuals. The fact that we found empirical evidence for the  microdosing practice as a contributor to an increased sense of state  authenticity is a novel finding within the literature examining the  precedents of state authenticity.  
>  
>Second, by  reviewing the literature on emotions and authenticity as well as the  literature on microdosing psychedelics, we made explicit two potential  mechanisms at work: the first pointing toward the role of mood as  eliciting higher states of authenticity and the second pointing towards  the microdosing practice as providing a supporting context for  value-aligned behaviours that we translated into more daily activities  and a higher satisfaction therein. Regarding the role of mood, while we  could replicate the results by [Lenton, Slabu et al. (2013)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr22-14550725231175353),  which found state authenticity to be related to both positive and  negative mood, our results did not provide support for the role of  affect as a mediator between microdosing and state authenticity. In  fact, the magnitude of the effect of the mood variables on authenticity  turned out to be quite small in comparison to the overall effect of  microdosing, that is after accounting for microdosing days, only daily  average negative mood was linked to decreased state authenticity.  Regarding the role of microdosing for mood, our results add to the mixed  reports from previous qualitative studies, i.e., microdosing practice  has been shown in some cases to improve mood but also to increase  certain negative emotions or decrease certain positive emotions ([Anderson et al., 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr2-14550725231175353); [Johnstad, 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr15-14550725231175353); [Pop & Dinkelacker, 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr27-14550725231175353)).  Regardless of the relationship between microdosing and emotional  states, suffice it to say that we did not find evidence supporting the  idea that it constitutes a path linking microdosing to state  authenticity.  
>  
>Regarding the second mechanism  that we proposed, when examining aggregated measures of the number of  activities and of the satisfaction with them, we found that both these  measures were higher on the day when participants took a microdose,  while the following day only the number of activities was higher. When  we disaggregated these measures and we looked at particular types of  activities, we found that the satisfaction with activities that reflect  chores and work (have-to's) and activities that reflect relational  aspects as well as health- or hobby-related activities was higher on one  or the other of the 2 days when an effect of microdosing is likely to  manifest. In addition, we found that on the day when participants have  microdosed they more likely engaged in chores and/or cooking and  hobbies/reading/writing.  
>  
>These results echo findings from qualitative studies, e.g., the study by [Andersson and Kjellgren (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr3-14550725231175353),  where the authors conclude that “it was described how the urge for  unhealthy habits lessened significantly while the motivation for more  exercise, healthier food, and less habitual use of social media was  premiered. Also, users reported less procrastination and a spontaneous  impulse to clean the house, tidy drawers, pay bills, or address other  postponed or neglected tasks.” (p. 5). While not directly testing this,  our findings could reflect a supportive context created by microdosing  in the sense of increasing energy, focus and creativity, decreasing mind  wandering and increasing mindfulness and the quality of being in the  present, as reflected by previous studies ([Polito & Stevenson, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr26-14550725231175353)). Furthermore, they could also reflect the two-step process that was uncovered by [Andersson and Kjellgren (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr3-14550725231175353),  i.e., gaining insights and follow-up desire to act according to these  insights. All the above mechanisms could explain the relationships found  between microdosing practice, number and types of activities, the  reported satisfaction with activities and, ultimately, the level of  state authenticity. Since we did not directly test these mechanisms,  future research is warranted.  
>  
>Generally, our results put previous findings on state authenticity into perspective: while [Lenton, Slabu et al. (2013)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr22-14550725231175353)  argued that judgements of our own authenticity are made in the moment  using general emotional state as a heuristic, our findings imply that  improving mood may not be the only avenue to increase authenticity.  Specifically, it may be even more fruitful to be engaging in valued  habits that are “objectively” good and experiencing satisfaction with  them (i.e., a cognitive form of appraisal), rather than only feeling  good. Therefore, the memorable phrase by [Lenton, Slabu et al. (2013)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr22-14550725231175353)  “I feel good, therefore I am real” might be altered to “I do what is  important to me and I am satisfied with it, therefore I am real”.  
>  
>While  the above findings are compelling and in line with qualitative  research, we note that the full causal chain was not tested. For  example, we were not able to examine the impact of the microdosing  practice on mind wandering and absorption, or the alleged effect on  facilitating insights on what is important for individuals, their core  values. This has to do with the availability of the data and constitutes  a limitation of our study. However, it also offers a possibility for  follow-up studies that will examine the step-by-step causal chain that  we spelled out as well as other potential mechanisms at work. The  benefits of future research on this topic are evident as it will  directly contribute to the better understanding of how microdosing could  influence behaviour and by this could translate in a higher felt  authenticity, with follow-up effects on wellbeing. A second limitation  of our study is the sample size of participants. This deficiency was  compensated by the time interval across which we collected data as well  as the number of observation days. We also note that simulation analyses  have shown that even with such low sample sizes the regression  coefficients and their standard errors are only negligibly biased ([Maas & Hox, 2005](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14550725231175353#bibr24-14550725231175353)). A larger sample size covering a more diverse population is certainly needed to increase the robustness of our findings.  
>  
>Another  limitation concerns the potential placebo effects that cannot be  addressed with these data. This, combined with the variability in doses  and regimens for microdosing, makes it impossible to distinguish between  genuine drug effects and placebo effects. While genuine drug effects  are undoubtedly relevant to our understanding of microdosing, our study  takes a different approach. Our study aims to capture the effects of  microdosing in a natural setting, where variations in factors, such as  dosage and regimen, are expected. This approach increases the external  validity of the results, reflecting real-world conditions in which  individuals are likely to have different practices, sensitivities to  substances and goals for microdosing.  
>  
>In  conclusion, we have found evidence that the microdosing practice was  related to higher ratings of state authenticity and that a behavioural  mechanism is most likely at work. Our study opens the door to a new line  of research as we propose that feeling and behaving authentically could  have a central role in explaining the positive effects of microdosing  on health and wellbeing that are reported by current research. In  addition, our data collection design captures the effects of a  microdosing practice in a natural setting. It embraces the inherent  variability in regimens and dosages while ensuring a common  understanding of microdosing among participants. This approach enhances  the external validity of our findings and reflects real-world  conditions. Furthermore, our study is a positive example of the use of  experience sampling methods with the use of a phone app, and an  invitation for researchers to further explore this methodology.

2023-05-25 13:42:40,Microdosing and feel overly hyper,"Hello
I experience very high generalized anxiety, over thinking, depression in life. Therapy, psych meds and the like have never really helped.

I've microdosed on and off in 2018 and again this year. I noticed this week (and it's happened before), that I become extremely hyper from microdosing. It's magic mushrooms and honestly the smallest quantity I can measure out (0.03g). I take it at 6am. By like 3pm the same day for the next 48 hours it feels like I've drank pots of coffee. My anxiety feels substantially reduced but it's almost like too much energy coursing in me. I'm currently going through a hard breakup that the day before (non microdosed) was leaving me crying for hours. The day I microdosed, I saw this person and it had absolutely no effect on me and I couldn't even emotionally connect to what they're saying.

Curious if this is a normal response or if there's a way to tamp down the hyper. Thanks",33,921,5,163,0

2023-05-25 07:11:56,Took my first 0.9 gram dried dose.,"So I’ve been depressed for a good while, maybe 6 months since I had long Covid (thankfully that is over). I had a bad break up recently and have not been able to stop thinking obsessively about my ex, and have basically been by myself, ruminating, crying and feeling sorry about myself.

Anyway, I ordered 4 grams of cubensus off a dark market, and weighed my 0.9 grams out and within half an hour, I was dancing and felt love in my body. I looked outside at a tree that’s in bloom and I was shocked at how beautiful it was. I then was able to get started cleaning my apartment. 

Have a good day!

EDIT: typo! Was 0.09 grams!

UPDATE:

Took another microdose the day after. Similar feeling but had to work, was very tired and there was anxiety about the work and I just didn’t really care enough about it.. so maybe I think 0.1 grams could be too much for working/

However, something else I have noticed.. MY DREAMS!  My dreams recently (before microdosing) have been horrendous and disturbing.. the past two nights my dreams have been beautiful.. last night found a secret beautiful beach by my hometown (which isn’t by the sea btw) and literally just went sunbathing for my whole dream with my dad.

Apologies for the long post. I am ready to start micro dosing and need a wee bit of guidance, pls.  

 I have been sober 25 years and the only pharma drugs I’ve ever taken has been in the last two years for menopause (estrogen and progesterone), and I balked on that for the 2 years prior until extreme thoughts invaded. I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD that has really escalated since this stage of life with some memory issues scattered about. I don’t recognize myself in many ways and truly believe I can get back to a more authentic Self through psilocybin. 

I acquired an ounce of mushrooms from a coworker who had great experiences with this strain, but both of us are unsure what kind they are. :/  Until I am able to cultivate my own in 5 months, this is what I’m using. I’d like to take a lower-than-average dose to start given what I shared with you and will do Stamet’s protocol, just not so many days in a row. Not sure I want to take the niacin due to all the hot flushes I'm trying to keep at bay.

What dose would be ideal for me to start and which size capsule for that dose? 

Approximately how long should this ounce last if dosing 2 to 3x weekly (bad at math).

Was it but a Panic attack? First thing that went through my head though was a bizarrely delayed truffel come up.

It's just weird because normally I have a fast metabolism, so I wouldnt expect a delay. And there is absolutely no reason for me to have a panic attack at this point in my life, if it's that.

A week ago I finally decided to stop my SSRIs and I began to md 2 days ago. I'm trying to follow the stamets stack (though I haven't been able to add the lions mane or niacin just yet so I'm basically just using the time line of on for 4, off for 3). 

I utilize premade chocolate bars that use 3.5 grams of Golden Teacher Magic mushrooms. I take about .58 g because I've heard the bars aren't as strong as just straight mushrooms, but I'm also not sure that's right. I don't feel any effects on this dose, but I also know it takes about 2 weeks of being off SSRIs for them to stop dulling the effects. 

I'm really unsure about this dosage, but I also have no idea how many weeks to keep up this regimen or how long to break for. 

Any tips would be much appreciated.",19,1104,4,206,0

2023-05-23 07:12:47,"Need guidance : Microdosing for ADHD, anxiety and depression (asking for a friend)","Hi everyone,

First, thank you for taking the time to read that long post and for your help

\- About my friend :  
He's 42, from  the country of croissant and baguette, diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety disorder, got prescribed ritaline to manage the symptoms, considers Psylocibin MD instead.

\- Background :  
He's been unemployed for 2 years after a burn-out but since one and half year he's working as a System windows administrator full remote (before he was more like an IT Coordinator supervising the workload, the request and incidents in a ITIL process, so less technical)He's not very interested in this field and has a hard time keeping his jobs (3 in one year), because he can't handle the stress, the owerwork, the understaffing and overall bad environnement.  
He also have a lot of trouble to acquire the new technical knowledge needed, especially powershell scripting cause like he's used to say 'I don't have a math mind' (He thinks he probably suffered from dyscalculia as a child  which seems pretty obvious looking at his school reports)  
This leads to excessive stress, overwhelming emotions, procrastination, analysis paralysis and low self esteem.It's because of his feeling of boredom, impulsivity, and inahability to focus on tasks he doesn't like that led him to be tested for ADHD.  
He was prescribed ritalin by his doctor who is a reference in the field in our country but it seems to increase his anxiety a lot as he feels it constantly and had a panic attack for the first time a few weeks ago.  
That doctor doesn't do the medical follow-up so he's activily loooking after another psychiatrist to find the right medication and dosage but none are available for new patients before months.He feels stuck and depressed, he's trying to do everything the right way but the process is slow and he is afraid of losing his job again or to quit impulsively again.  
He works out 4 times a week, hike in the forest, tried supplements, meditation, and started cognitive-behavioral therapy, everything that can help he does.

After taking informations here on Reddit, youtube, podcasts, reading the protocols etc, he's considering Microdosing psylocibin truffles with the hope of being able to feel a bit of relief and get out of that spiral.From what we undestand, where we live, we dont have access to psylocibin capsules like we see from a canadian brand but only fresh truffles sold in vaccum sealed portion of 1gram from Nederlands.  
He's a bit worried of trying Microdosing, he never used any drugs of any kind in his life (scared of bad reaction)

\- In conclusion, he would like to know if microdosing psylocibin truffles could help him manage all the stuffs explained above and which protocol and products would be better for him.

Thanks again for your time and help :)",82,2802,13,474,0

I have a high alcohol tolerance, but a low drug tolerance so I’ve always felt stronger effects compared to my friends when taking different kinds. 

I deal with daily anxiety, and I’d try weed but a very limited amount and I’d always find myself spiraling and not enjoying the trip as much as I should. I thought it was normal.

2023-05-22 17:21:24,Microdosing magic mushrooms vs anti depressants for anxiety,"How would you compare microdosing to anti depressants for anxiety?

 I’m growing mushrooms at the moment but struggling with anxiety and low mood. I keep telling myself I don’t want to go back on anti depressants. Only one has ever worked (venlafaxine/Effexor) but it had nasty - if manageable - side effects. I’ve also started it twice and come off it twice, so it’s familiar. The others either did nothing or the side effects were unbearable.

I’m also growing magic mushrooms. I have three small grow bags on the go. The first is in fruiting conditions but I’m not convinced it’s going to fruit. The last one (probably my best bet) was only inoculated last Wednesday. 

I could ring the doctor tomorrow and get a prescription for venlafaxine, but I’m basically guaranteed to feel awful for at least a week, and it’ll take several more until I feel better, if I do at all. There’s no guarantee. Maybe last time it was just a placebo. 

Or I could wait and hope that the mushrooms do grow and that they do help.

In the meantime I am doing other stuff to help - I’m eating and sleeping better, taking my multivitamin, and last week I even started meditating again. But I’m not consistent and I’m stuck in avoidant patterns and feelings of helplessness.

I know that my sense of urgency is the anxiety itself. I know that. But it’s hard to let it go.

A short, personal account of how this routine has changed (me) in my daily life.","For context: from late December: \[2019-2023\] having grown my own B+ shrooms taking doses of between 3 to 4 dried grams (with a gap of 5 days between consumption) I experienced ego-death on several occasions.

Now, in \[2024\] when I wake at around 8:00am I swallow (on an empty stomach) a single (250mg capsule) of: B+ powdered magic-mushroom (in capsule form) before going about my day. What I have noticed is that I'm a far nicer, better version of myself. This came to light in February this year when a woman in front of me (at a checkout) stumbled backwards. I caught her fall before she hit the deck - which any decent citizen would do. I apologized for having to touch her (during her fall) and said without having to think about it ""**I didn't want any harm to come to you**"".

The checkout line kept moving but the woman kept peering back at me with a look of kinship, warmth, and a focus in her eyes I'd never seen expressed by anyone - especially what with me being a perfect stranger (a nobody in reality to her). All I can think, is that she picked-up on the absolute sincerity of my soul-filled words (*if you will allow me to put it that way).* It was if, we instantly recognised the (inner being) of other. Prior to microdosing. I would still have caught the woman's fall but, the way I would have talked to her wouldn't have brought about a 'soul-connection'.

I'm thinking' that microdosing dampens the necessity for my (persona/ego) to be ***so,*** en-garde, -excessively defensive.

At work, the abrupt-sounding people I need to converse with are no longer able to rile me. I'm now able to converse in a ***new*** way that completely diffuses the friction they are carrying.

Throughout my day, I remain super-calm and have a newfound ability to talk to anyone regardless of how 'intimidating' they might appear or sound to: **non**\-**micro** takers. I'm not evangelising for microdosing - I'm simply explaining the profound effect it has had on me - which if I had to explain in a nutshell, is a **massive** increase in warmth and empathy to others regardless of what walk-of-life they come from.

\[Arguably, 250mg is a heavy dose but; I'm 6ft 3"" (200lbs) and this dose feels just right for me and B+ isn't a particularly strong strain of shroom\].

2023-05-21 13:03:27,In regards to the recent post about heart valve damage,"While there is no clear evidence microdosing can cause heart valve issues there is also no evidence proving the contrary. I’ve been saying it for a long time and most people seem to shrug it off but IMO microdosing for a period of two months can provide a total of 8 months of therapy. In the recovery world this is referred to the addiction interrupter. The rewiring of the brain from ibogaine lasts 6 months after the administration of the drug and through observation I believe 2 months of microdosing can do the exact same thing. 

I implore you all to consider the fact that microdosing does not operate in the same way that traditional medications do. Because the mechanism of action changes the way our brain talks to itself there is theoretically no need for prolonged dosing. I believe one 2 month session can provide years of lasting benefits and in extreme situations upkeep 1-2 month rounds of dosing after the 6 month interruption period are just as effective if not more effective than continuous dosing. Not to mention it could seriously minimize the potential risk related to heart valve conditions.",54,1115,10,192,0

This time, I was like.. ok, shit happens .. no big deal and I went on with my day. I realized it’s allowing me to step away and view things from a different perspective and making me really process on the sidelines before I react.

I've moved from LSD to psilocybin after a couple of months' break. I took .05 two days ago - didn't feel (almost) anything at all, so I took .1 yesterday - felt a touch more, had a little  emotional moment a little after taking it and a pretty nice day, although I'm not sure I've felt my state of mind being much different than usual, other than that moment in the morning (I'm generally very attuned to my conscious state, and aware of it being altered). 

Today I took .15 and didn't feel anything at all, aside from being a little tired, and a little surprised to realize it's actually Friday, because I didn't get the usual Friday vibe, bur I get tired often, and the Friday thing has happened more than once before 😅

I'm wondering how to proceed, thinking to maybe take .2 tomorrow?
I took LSD in the fadiman protocol, and was thinking to take mushrooms 4 on/3 off or something like that, but I've also read some opinions here about tolerance with that schedule.. 

I'm stacking it with 500mg lion's mane and a B-complex with 100mg if each vitamin. Is that a relevant amount of niacin, or should I increase it, and to how much?

2023-05-19 07:06:09,How Do You Know When To Open Your Mouth... Or Shut it?,"Hello all. So... I had a very interesting and kind of disheartening experience this week. I went to a new psychiatrist after my current psychiatrist referred me to a centre where I could get some counsellling, attend group therapy, and do some good work on myself while I'm not working. All that and a med review! I'm currently in the (painfully slow!) process of cutting down my meds, since all the bloody migraine drugs are seditives, and I'm always drowsy. I've had chronic migraines for four years. 

I have been microdosing now for a few months. I'm very lucky, my brother is involved with Health Canada, making a psilocybin product for sale (full spectrum extract, standardized psilocybin, psilocin and baeocystin), so I've been getting samples from him. Eventually I'll get back into growing, as that was my first real love. Ever since the very first time I took mushrooms, I've felt the desire, nay, the NEED to grow them! Everyone always said that mine were the best, after I fed them my special nutrient blend of gypsum, bee pollen, cocca, and more (have to look it up!) I've noticed that microdosing has had more positive effects on my mental wellbeing than the psychiatric meds I take.

I used to be such an easygoing guy, very chill. My head was always clear and full of facts before the migraines and all the meds, now I'm cloudy and anxious. The meds have made me ill, it seems, and the migraines and not working, combined with extreme stress of loosing my family in this time have fucked me up. I'm convinced that psilocybin will help my recovery!

I have had MANY psychadellic experiences in the past, just not in the past few years. Mushrooms, LSD, DMT, 5-MEO-DMT, 2-C-B, etc... I can't do it now, while I'm sorting my shit out. Too much rides on set and setting, I know that, and my set is fucked right now. A good trip may be just what the doctor ordered though, who knows!

So.... I went to this consult, and tell the new psych and the other team member everything. Full drug history is included in the intake, and I can see some judgement building in their eyes, but I don't think its that bad. In the past, I've been able to always justify my microdosing and tripping, and hell, my recreational""activities"" even with a whole hell of knowledge, confidence, and that's been that. Lately I've just been feeling down though, and my head has been cloudy, so that probably contributed to the eventual outcome...

I've always had a policy of never hiding anything from my doctor's. I've always been 100% open and honest with them, offering up more info than they ask, and this is the first time I've had an issue. After all the history taking I get to diagnosis. I'm diagnosed with every substance disorder under the sun! Stimulant use disorder, alcohol use disorder, hallucinogen use disorder (though I'm not using them to hallucinate!!!), I argue the point, but to no avail. Bah! I'm barred from entering the program too, because ""studies show that people on the amount of drugs your on can't take part in group therapy and gain benefit"", and ""the microdosing would have to stop"". WHAT? How the hell does that even affect what goes on in therapy?

Instead, they want to refer me to an inpatient treatment center for a 90 day stay, to wean me off my meds. Honestly, I'd be ok with that, as I'd get off these pharmaceuticals quickly, and I could get back to my dosing and personal journey of wellbeing! It would be a bloody hard thing to go through though...

Thanks for letting me rant. I've been away from this board for a while, and after today when I had this appointment, just had to get this out. Hope my story was an entertaining read at least.

2023-05-18 17:53:07,Can microdosing help my alcoholism?,"I'm an alcoholic who drinks daily. I use alcohol to mask my severe anxiety and depression. I had a really traumatic childhood that I consciously hardly remember. I also have ptsd from being shot as an adult and being a sex worker for all of my 20's. 


I really want to quit drinking but my anxiety is so bad everytime I try to quit, the anxiety overwhelms me. I have extreme social anxiety to the point of panic attacks in public. My husband is my only friend because I can't socialize with strangers very well.


 I have alot of tics like I can't maintain eye contact and feel like I go cross-eyed or I'm spitting when I talk or that I constantly have to wipe my nose because I feel I have something on my face. 


It's utter hell and I end up feeling very drained after even the slightest outing or talking to a stranger. I also have adhd and crohn's disease and likely ocd by my mild need to do certain repetitive things for personal reasons.


 My mom has severe ocd so I know the symptoms. Also everytime I've tried to whiteknuckle it and quit drinking my crohns flares up so bad I end up in the hospital because stress flares crohns up.


I also come from a family who has schizophrenia.  My mom's uncle killed his whole family and she was told her dad was pretty abusive and crazy himself. I know for a fact my mom is crazy. 


Which leads me to my question here. I know macrodosing mushrooms has been proven to help addiction however I accidentally took a macrodose of lsd at a festival a few years ago and I had the worst time of my life. 


I was very drunk at the time too. Days later I felt like I was going crazy and had a strong desire to hurt myself. It left me with prolonged fear of still being stuck in the trip and never making it out. I still struggle with the memory of it. 


I think I have schizophrenia tendencies and I don't want to unlock a door I can't close. But I'm so miserable with my alcoholism. I have tried so many different medications. Xanax. Wellbutrin. Ssri. Therapy. Cbt/dbt. Cbd. I can't take thc because it causes extreme panic. Now I'm taking hydroxyzine for anxiety but it doesn't help. I've tried meditation, yoga you name it. 


I take vyvanse for adhd and depression. Amphetamines seem to be the only thing that helps my depression but it also amps up my anxiety. Causing me to drink more alcohol. I've been stuck in this loop for years. 


So I decided to try microdosing mushrooms despite my traumatic experience with lsd. I grew golden teachers last year and started taking some however I stopped because I read a study about mushrooms affecting the rhythm of the heart. And wouldn't you know it but I also have an irregular heartbeat. 



But now I'm back to taking the golden teachers. I figured I can't keep living like this and the alcohol is gonna hurt my heart either way. Given my hereditary predisposition to schizophrenia and previous experiences with psychosis, is it a good idea to continue microdosing? 


Would I ever be able to macrodose? I just want to leave the trauma behind. Leave the paranoia and fear of everything and everyone behind. I want to not smell and look like shit all the time. I feel like a prisoner in my own body. I'm on a wait list now for mental health to try therapy again for the 100th time. But idk what else to do. Sorry this is so long.",35,3327,5,617,0

2023-05-18 13:09:33,Telling my new doctor about mushrooms,"I've previously experienced depression and mental health issues on and off over my life, and have been prescribed and taken various meds with some deeply unpleasant results, and participated in various talking and other therapies which have not been particularly successful, other than for depleting my savings.

And then I discovered microdosing both mushrooms and LSD, then therapeutic macro doses of mushrooms. All of which have had a profoundly positive effect on my wellbeing and transformed my life experience. They really do work for me and don't come with any dependency or side effect issues, as other drugs have.

So, I've moved towns and had to go to a new GP (MD). They wanted to review my health in general which prompted a discussion about my mental well-being, and so I was open about my occasional microdosing. My previous doctor was very open-minded and familiar with current research, and was actually supportive as mushrooms worked for me despite their illegally.

Oh my, I wish I hadn't mentioned it to my new doc. I felt so judged ... 
""Drugs are bad ... You don't know what's in them (yes, I do) ... You don't know there they've come from (wrong again, I picked them) ... They are illegal and you're breaking the law ... etc""

They were absolutely for me being drugged out on big pharma shit, completely disregarding my deeply negative personal experiences of meds and overwhelmingly positive experience of mushrooms. They weren't interested in research or evidence. Drugs are bad. You need to see a psychiatrist. You need to take other (legal) drugs (that don't work for me, when psychedelics do).

I live in a very small community with only one small medical practice. I'm upset at their closed-minded and judgemental attitude and, to be frank, really quite  angry. Grrrr.

I suppose I should have just kept my mouth shut rather than being honest.
This is just a rant to get it off my chest, just sharing, but what are your experiences?

I hope that you have more and better support in your microdosing wherever you are.
Big love to you ❤️

2023-05-18 12:54:43,My experience & can I use daily,"Hi all,

2 months ago an old friend who is into health and well being, crystals, sound healing, meditation type of vibe mentioned she could get some mushrooms, that I should try. So I bought 10 weeks worth which are broken down into 300mg capsules with the advice of every other day or 3 times a week. 

My reason for taking mushrooms was to see if it could help me change my mental state. I’ve historically had a problem with alcohol, gone through all manner of hell. Weed has helped me in between drinking to stay off it because I found it to be the lesser evil. However all of that needing some sort of buzz has had an effect on my central nervous system, my subconscious, and definitely my chemical balance. My attention span was awful, not bothered or interested in much and lacking any enthusiasm. Repeating the same things, like watching films I’ve watched before, or music I’ve heard, never wanting anything new. I never saw a doctor about it. Just got on with feeling not happy I guess. I’ve never wanted to do anything drastic, it’s just a low energy that only spiked when I had substances. So…

My experience with micro dosing initially was a bit tainted with apprehension, I’ve had other drugs in my time, usually only weed sober but everything else mixed with alcohol in a social setting. I started off with 100mg as a test day, and felt different, certainly less inward looking. I tried 300mg and could it was definitely more noticeable.

After weeks of on and off experimenting, I’ve found a nice little vibe I get from a smaller dose. At the minute I’m taking approx 50mg in the morning in my tea, mixed in with a little dash of lions mane tincture with some cordyceps also, and a touch of theanine. Then I head into my daily meditation and my day begins.

I find lions mane and the micro dose combo to be quite a nice stack, it definitely sharpens my critical thinking, and certainly not afraid to speak my mind, more social, emotional intelligence pretty sharp, and most importantly I wear a smile on my face and open a part of me I knew was there but was subdued. I’ve been meditating for about 6 months now, so my awareness levels have increased significantly, micro dosing with mushrooms has also led me to asking some serious questions, such as the noticeable difference of mindset when I start smoking weed, whether it’s worth it or not.

So far, my experience has been very positive.

So to my question.. can I sustain 50mg or similar a day continuously without break? I don’t feel like I have to have it each day, so taking a break each week is also fine, but wondering if any users have had long term experience with it.

I turned hypomanic without even realizing it and have ruined small bits of my life over these past two-three months.

I think mushrooms are incredibly healing, and amazing. However I think for Bipolar people, or people with PTSD, it is not a good idea. It felt amazing at first, and it felt like it was helping me out, but eventually I woke up one day in an incredibly depressive state without a real cause or reason besides mushrooms and being off of my meds.

Just writing this out to warn others with the same disorders as me. I could have really lost myself and ruined my life over the past few days. I felt like I was going to kill someone. I had dreams of it. I had thoughts about it. I won't be discontinuing my medication anymore. It may seem like it is helping at first, but it is not. I was already fine before trying mushrooms, there was no need for me to try and ""fix"" myself.

Of course, different person, different journey, different experience. This was mine. I have a feeling this happens often to more people. Stay safe...

2023-05-17 09:56:36,Microdosing reports: 8th cycle - From healing to growing,"Microdosing substance: 1P-LSD

Protocol: Fadiman, 1 day on 2 days off

Active administration: 4 weeks

Period of break after administration: 2 weeks

Other substances i take:

* *Ashwagandha* only during the break weeks (daily 300mg) + sometimes at need
* *Magnesium* daily
* *Caffeine + l-theanine* in the form of greentea once daily

I don't drink alchol and i don't smoke weed except for occasional CBD use now.

Currently on therapy:  psychoanalitic psychotherapy.

*Microdosing complete time since the beginning of the first cycle:* 63weeks, or 441 days.

> Please note that i'm writing this report a couple of weeks later from the actual end of the cycle, so this might not be 100% accurate.

# From healing to growing

What i'm finding out, especially in my latest cycles, is that i feel a complete absence of the anxiety or depression i felt before this therapeutic route. This is valid both for administration and pause days: while i would slip back into my anxiety-depression pit whenever i took a break, now i may feel a mild discomfort that is totally manageable: sometimes i might actually feel better in my pause weeks than during administration.

I'm not saying i'd feel completely okay if i stopped microdosing now, therapeutic effects are still there even if they are less perceived because the baseline is higher. 

*The process of healing is a process of transmormation, a process of growth itself.*

But anyway this balance and safety i feel now made my target shift in a new direction: from microdosing to feel better, to microdosing for growing!

## A powerful tool to change habits

Used the right way, and especially if you pair it with theraphy as i do, microdosing can help tremendously to change your habits.

In the end, when you heal, you are just changing some unhealthy patterns. If you want, you can create new patterns you decide!

In my experience a change happens by following this schedule:

1. Push into creating a new habit
2. Rest and completely surrender: accept wheter you cannot *always* stick with it (because you won't at first and you won't ever be ""perfect"") 
3. Normalize it.
4. Understand your ""blocks"".

Start back.

It is not really different from working out: you can't start to work out everyday and think you will stick with it, but you can try, then rest and most importantly not mortify yourself, then start again once you feel refreshed, after that you just need to feel that new habit as something normal (not as a novelty), then understand if there's something blocking you to keep practicing or practicing better.

### 1. Push into creating a new habit

Microdosing deactivates premade patterns: at first it will make you more conscious on what actually feels good and what doesn't, so it will also be easier for you to distinguish between what you *need and enjoy* to do and what you actually don't.

Sometimes we like or don't like something just because of preconceptions not based on the actual experience, or based on a wrong perception of the experience, microdosing removes this.

It really makes a difference thinking from
>""I am not a person who likes sport and i'm trying this new one to see if i can just be healthier""

To

>""I'm practicing this sport and it makes my body feel really good, even though i just started"".

After that you can start practicing, this will require work and time and it will get you tired after a while, this is normal.

### 2. Rest and completely surrender

At some point you will feel tired and you will need a rest from all the work you've been doing: wheter it is a mental rest or a physical rest, you will need it!

A mental rest could mean coming back to more reacheable (whether because familiar or easily available) sources of satisfaction, that doesn't imply a lot of work to be reached.

Everything can be an incredible place of pleasure if completely explored in its deepest meanings, but the human nature will always need to reach out for strongly pleasurable experiences.
In this process of transformation, especially at the beginning, it will be hard to find that needed satisfaction in a new habit.

You always need to find pleasure in things you do, not just work, and if that pleasure cannot be found enough, it is to be found somewhere else. And HAS to be found somewhere else at some point.

That feeling of needing to rest can also coincide with your breaks from microdosing, especially if microdosing lsd, as you'll feel a bit the lack of stimulation it adds.

### 3. Normalize it

This is another thing microdosing helps a lot with.

You know that feeling that makes you feel ""the type of person who doesn't work out"" coming back to our example?

The switch from ""i'm just trying a new sport"" to ""i am practicing this sport"" is much more reachable.

*It makes a new thing yours faster.*

Normalization deals a lot with self perception, that's why memes usually help normalize stuff happening in the world, because making something funny is a way of making it more familiar, therefore to find it near to our perception of selves.

How do i perceive this thing related to me? As something new and far or as something that is *part* of my *(personality, things i enjoy, things i love)*?

### 4. Understand your blocks

Whether it is lack of energy availability, time, organization, anxiety, people, situations, or every other possible reason, you will find blocks along your way.

This is, i believe, the most challenging part, because it comes to actual decision making and finding creative solutions to problems.

When something starts taking space in your life, there will be a moment where you'll have to decide what your priorities are and if you really wanna keep expanding or not.

Those blocks are limits that can really be represented by a lot of things, wheter they are phisycal or mental. This is the space where the 1-3 cycle can be expanded faster and way more far.

Taking the decision to prefer something over something else means taking a risk, and you always take a risk when changing.
Removing this blocks would look different for each of them. Maybe you decide to stop your current job to start working with your passion, maybe you need to leave a person or to find the courage to get in touch with another one, maybe you need to address the fact that your social anxiety regarding a new thing actually hides a fear of being rejected etc etc..

*But some limits need to be accepted...*

If you don't wanna remove that limit for whatever reason or you actually **like** that limit (in this case it's better to call it a *border*) that's good too, especially because we cannot be succesful in everything and there will always be a place where we cannot go. So accepting some limits (if they are impossible to change or simply we don't want to change them because they make us feel good) is a very fundamental skill too!

This is where real, long lasting change happens.
_

## Closing

This maybe went a bit beyond the scope of a microdosing report, but i found this tool to be incredibly helpful with this specific type of cyclic loop that i found a lot in my life.

I will definetly update and say if it is working well, but what i can say now is that by this mechanism i was able to start working out regularly, studying regularly, taking some care and responsabilities and being much more social and open!

2023-05-17 03:58:42,Irregular dose schedule: am I missing out on potential gains?,"Title basically says it all. I have been having a hard time remembering to take my MD some days, and thus my schedule is totally erratic. 

It was easier when i just took a capsule first thing, but it sometimes really upset my tummy... So i started making a ginger tea concoction, and taking it after I've eaten breakfast. Depending on my day, i sometimes just get distracted before i get around to this process. As a result, I've only been taking them 2-3x a week, and always in random days.

I definitely still feel a great effect in the day I'm taking them: happy, emotionally stable, motivated. However, I'm wondering if I'm going to be missing out on the cumulative effects... The comparison I thought of was with physical exercise: if you only do it sporadically, you may feel good after a work out, but probably not getting much in terms of long term gains.

Am i robbing myself of the full potential of this therapy by not sticking to a regular schedule? And if so, anyone have any pointers for how to be more consistent?

2023-05-17 02:38:51,Microdosing and edibles,"Hi gang! I have been microdosing for about 3 months. Prior to MDing, I used to consume THC edibles regularly, maybe once a week.

Due to my job situation, I wasn’t able to consume THC much in those 3 months, I have taken two edibles in that time. Each time I have felt I’ve been on the brink of losing my mind. I’ve had to call my friends in panic and I’ve prayed to GOD to keep my spirit safe. Last time I was on a walk and I felt like I wasn’t moving anywhere. 

Safe to say, I’m never going to consume weed again. However, I notice I’ve only had this reaction since I’ve started micro-dosing. Has anyone ever experienced that? What is the relationship between THC and shrooms? I’m curious so see why this is coming up.

2023-05-15 15:44:35,Back to SSRIs (sertraline) after failed microdosing attempt," I (27F) was on 50mg sertraline for around 2 years, which did a great job at helping me through depression, but I didn’t want to take it forever due to the lack of motivation/sleepiness that I felt while taking it. I tapered off and eventually stopped taking it in May 2022, but started to feel a bit of despair/depression creeping in again as winter approached.

Since I didn’t want to go back to feeling awful again, I thought I would try microdosing mushrooms. I started in November 2022 - I followed the Fadiman's protocol and took around 0.2mg for a while before going down to 0.1mg (0.2mg was too strong for me and made me feel ‘high’ in work, so lowering my dose and taking it after work seemed better).

Things seemed to be going well for a good few months. I felt noticeably less anxious, particularly in work, and definitely less depressed. I got through winter way better than I would have done otherwise, and managed to feel more motivated to exercise and think positively about my future. 

The problems began when I took my two week tolerance break and tried to restart my schedule again - around January/February. Everything seemed to be going okay, but I didn’t feel like I was functioning quite as well as I was before the tolerance break. Then, whilst on holiday with my partner towards the end of March, I had a panic attack completely out of the blue whilst in a restaurant. I felt completely overwhelmed out of nowhere, like the walls were closing in and everyone was watching me. 

I tried to return to work a few days later and had another panic attack, so took some time off. I’ve never had panic attacks before so it was pretty scary that they became a regular part of my life for a short while, to the extent that I had to change my role at work so that I wouldn't be around as many people for a while. I continued to microdose for a bit, but eventually started to realise that the microdose itself could be contributing to the overwhelming anxiety that I was feeling every day. I stopped microdosing and the anxiety/panic attacks continued. Around a month of ‘cold turkey’ passed before I decided that I couldn’t continue like this, so I went back to taking sertraline, which has very quickly helped me to return to a feeling of normality.

I should mention the obvious side notes: I have a very stressful and often depressing ‘social welfare’ related job that involves trying to deal with a lot of other people’s trauma on a very low income, and I’ve experienced a lot of heavy life things such as grief/injury/family meltdown/relationship issues over the past few years. I have seen a few therapists, and have more therapy lined up to start soon. 

I am trying to be kind to myself and understand that no one substance or medicine can really 'cure' me of all these things that I'm trying to deal with, but I’m sad that microdosing didn’t help me through it all in the end.

As for sertraline - like I previously said, I don’t want to be on antidepressants forever, but I’m so grateful that there’s something I can take in order to help me function like a normal human again. The positive difference in myself from just a few weeks of going back to SSRIs is completely mind blowing, and so far I haven't actually experienced the 'bad' side effects of SSRIs that I previously had, like tiredness/lack of motivation/no sex drive.",59,3355,8,602,0

2023-05-13 21:16:39,Governments Putting Big Pharma Interests Ahead of Citizens Well Being,"Psilocybin's benefits in treating addictions, which include withdrawal symptoms, have been known at least since the 1950s when it was legal and researched. It was found to be extremely effective in the treatment of depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and various addictions including tobacco and alcohol. Some things native communities had known for probably thousands of years.

LSD was liberated from the labs and universities in the 60s and young people began using them freely and openly. With some abuse and lots of political agendas psychedelics were reported as highly addictive, unsafe, both untrue, and made illegal by the early 70s, removing them from public use and any useful research and development as medicines. Thankfully (said sarcastically) we were allowed to have narcotics and other actually highly addictive but profitable meds. So for 50 years our all wise governments saved us from some of the most effective, safe, and inexpensive meds that are still growing wild all over the world. But Pharma is working on ways to own it.

Then about ten years ago some research in non-USA countries, and very quietly in a couple of US universities, started reporting ""surprising"" results, that these hallucinogens were showing promising effects on depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, some pains, addictions, and withdrawal symptoms. Often two to four times more effective for depression than the currently over-prescribed meds. That's not to say psychedelics cannot be abused. Anything can be.

Even though that research was highly stigmatized by the pharmaceutical and medical communities (surprise), in 2018 psilocybin was granted ""breakthrough therapy"" status. It's hard to ignore the benefits that are in plain sight and becoming more widely known daily, especially when there is a growing tidal wave of mental health issues in various countries, most especially in the US. It is now slowly gaining acceptance as one of the most effective and safe treatments for many conditions with more effectively treated conditions being discovered as more people try it to see how it can help them.

Even a few large cities have decided they will significantly reduce the priority or no longer enforce the laws against something that is helping so many people, like Denver, Oakland, Santa Cruz, Washington D.C., Somerville, Cambridge, Northhampton, Detroit, Seattle, Ann Arbor, San Francisco, Vancouver, and others. We just need governments to stop putting Big Pharma interests ahead of citizens well being.

Edit: It could be helpful if everyone who would like to see these meds decriminalized would write and/or call their state and federal representatives letting them know we want them to pass legislation that will get them out of the business of depriving us from the benefits of having these natural, effective, safe, and inexpensive home grown meds.",69,2853,10,449,0

2023-05-13 08:07:18,Which would have less side effects- Microdosing L or shrooms? (Acid reflux woes),"Been a bit since I've used either personally- though in particular shrooms way longer. In the past I've preferred L over shrooms as shrooms seem to not go good with me sometimes.  That said I'd imagine microdosing may be different.

That said- one thing that even made me think to ask this- my stomach has kinda gotten a little dicey over the years in the sense that I can easily get heartburn/acid reflux and I remember that being one annoying thing with L, and I think that may be true for microdosing too.

Would this be the case with shrooms too, could microdosing have stomach symptoms?

In the scheme of things it feels like a loss to not utilize them for these reasons but I don't wanna bug my body out. 

One thing tempting me tho is I could really use some kind of creative rejuvenation as a musician but I'm not gonna push it if it might mess with my acid reflux stuff. 

 Any ideas?

2023-05-13 07:51:42,Microdose Report Day 21-38,"**Warning: negative thoughts tonight.**

&#x200B;

Gambling Addiction:

I spend more than half the money I earn on gambling activities. There is an aversion to daily routine working (routine anxiety), so making a lot of money the easy way is very exciting. I hate the worry though... the back and forthness from going from +$10,000 to -$5000 in one week, and vice versa. I am severely in debt now, and my back hurts from all the sod work I've been doing (just to throw away the earnings). I can get back to net positive with time and effort, but it's hard to sleep at night stressing about random chance.

I want to make a lot of money so that I can get a place and get my love back. I would reconnect now, but I know deep down I need to support myself first to feel confident and to give her what she needs.

&#x200B;

be with my love <----- support myself and her <------- (make consistent money???)

&#x200B;

Stability In Career:

This leads to my ever growing motivation to practice programming to land a career. I am actually starting to feel sick having nothing to do, no friends, and no respect. I can't respect myself.

Besides my love, I also want: a real job, a new little motorcycle, a place to live with friends, cool traveling experiences, etc. Even if I did get rich gambling, I only really fulfill two of those, so it's not the right course.

&#x200B;

Masculinity Stolen:

My manhood was stolen when I was cheated on. I've yet to find it. Without it, it is hard to find a will. No human deserves to be cheated on. It breaks you. Every day I suffer thinking about her in hopes even though I understand logically.

A man like me just wants to support and take care of the woman he loves. It's a simple life. The thought of you needing anything (or our kids) is the ultimate motivation for me to get out of bed early in the morning. Without that, I don't have the fire. And even worse, its not that I don't have my love anymore, but that it ripped itself off my heart and ran away calling me terrible things. I would be my greatest self with my love, but now I'm too damaged to even find another. I'm a good guy, but every day the light dulls and I feel less good. I am getting disgusted with who I am becoming.

&#x200B;

Darkside Like Anakin:

I get more sad and frustrated every year. My wit is fried, and all the people around me treat me like a shell of my former self. No one ever hits me up on weekends anymore. I think about dying in random moments often, and cry daily. My care for society drops as I suffer more, and I notice myself bringing others down to my level so that they understand. If I'm being mistreated, I will let everyone feel it who is causing it (which is subjective and often completely wrong so I'm lashing out at good people). I am a piece of shit and a hypocrite to everyone I love.

I don't carry my own weight. My heart is sad about it, but it's not warm enough. And my memory is too fucked so the cycle repeats daily. I do things now that I can't even believe, and I can't consciously stop it. My moral wall is deteriorating. I don't even know if I can look at myself and say I'm a good person anymore, which is the one thing I always could rest my head back on even if I had nothing else. When I give, it's only so I feel happy. When I take, I don't even consider the work the other person did. I think about all the good ways to help those around me late at night, but when the time comes I only say pessimistic things in a bad fuzzy mood, and often time leave them upset with no progress. It creates a lot of guilt as you watch their lives go by and they grow more distant from you.

&#x200B;

Baby vs Adult:

The matureness in me wants to spread love and freeness and joy, but the hurt part of me (the baby) is so frustrated and sad that it lashes out. Both view reality through completely different moral lenses, and the functioning patterns of my brain seem to shift constantly.

&#x200B;

When a baby is separated from his mother and not shown the love it deserves, it is never the same. I think my first love was somehow put into the ""caretaker"" role in my brain, and left me, so now I feel abandonment issues. I feel like I can't handle direct love without wanting to run and do things on my own. I constantly try to figure things out on my own (rather than listen) because the love/trust/understanding/safety teased me so many times.

&#x200B;

Mushrooms:

It seems like ever since I started microdosing, my reality has been warm and fuzzy. It's nice in a way, but time is slipping away very quick and my memory is even worse.

2023-05-12 13:55:46,Can microdosing help me quit weed smoking?,"Hi everyone! 
I’ve been a heavy weed user many years. Initially weed was helping with my depression and anxiety and everything was great, but then after having some personal problems the depression and anxiety came back stronger than ever so I had to start taking antidepressants and been taking them alongside with smoking cannabis for the last 6 years.
Now already 3 weeks I’m off the antidepressants, but anxieties and sometimes depression is back. 
I think a big part of that is due to my heavy weed use (already 20 years) and I’m looking for an alternative for the both weed and antidepressants. 
My plan is to wait another month or two to clear my system from the medication and start micro-dosing firstly magic truffles and later own grown shroomies.

So my question is can micro-dosing give me the strength to quit weed?

I’m completely new to microdosing. I’m looking to do some work to help me have a more positive outlook on life, open my mind, bring some creativity in, etc.

I started microdosing last weekend and did 0.05g of psilocybin via gummies for 4 days (now in 3 days off).

I didn’t perceive anything outright though it’s possible my mindset was improved, but I noticed on the days that I microdosed (usually taken in the morning), my sleep was really disrupted. I don’t usually remember my dreams, but they were certainly more lucid than normal on the dose days. 

A bigger problem is that I kept waking up in the middle of the night and being unable to get back to sleep for at least and hour or two.

My girlfriend is also doing this with me and also had sleep issues though not as severe as I did.

I tried to see if this came up a lot for other people and so far it doesn’t seem like it’s common. I’m curious to know if others have experienced this and if it eventually works it’s way through.

>This paper presents a critical re-examination of the conclusions drawn  from Szigeti et al.'s (2021) “Self-blinding Citizen Science to Explore  Psychedelic Microdosing”. The current article’s approach was to a)  examine the utility of the guess and expectation variables from the  original research, b) explore if drug intensity plays a role in the  outcomes, and c) test for within-person variability in the outcomes and  effects. Reanalysis and reinterpretation finds that while the original  conclusions were partially supported, there are certain conditions for  subgroups of the sample which elicited positive psychedelic microdosing  effects when compared to placebo. More specifically, we find that there  are identifiable microdosing effects for participants who a) received  both the placebo and treatment during their trial (in terms of affective  benefits), b) felt some level of intoxication (instead of  sub-perceptual doses), c) can correctly identify placebo from treatment,  and d) participants with at least mild depression. ***This reinterpretation adds to a growing body of evidence that there do appear  to be certain benefits found for the use of microdoses of psychedelics.***

>first draft of a microdosing paper. It critically re-analyzes [@psybalazs](https://twitter.com/psybalazs), [@RCarhartHarris](https://twitter.com/RCarhartHarris) claim that microdosing is mostly placebo. I argue their own data shows microdosing superior to placebo for some individuals on some metrics. **feedback is welcome**

>2). if we just look at individuals who received both placebo and microdose, the psychedelic is superior to placebo for affective tests (mood) but not cognition. In the chart, the distribution of placebo outcomes should be different than zero:

>3). I think [@psybalazs](https://twitter.com/psybalazs) et al do reasonably cast doubt on [***subperceptual microdosing***](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/xvhup3/subperceptual_or_subhallucinogenic/)***.*** I think people might need to feel a little “high”. For participants who had perceptual experiences, the effect of microdosing is higher than placebo (the right blue square)

>4). The major problem with the original paper is that it overlies on participant ‘guess’ as a proxy for placebo. When folks have a particularly bad week (low mood), they’re going to guess they got the placebo. It’s impossible to disentangle guess from outcome.  
>  
>5). I disagree with [@psybalazs](https://twitter.com/psybalazs) that it’s possible to do blinded microdosing. Microdosing takes skill. Folks often need to be aware of an altered state and use proven therapy strategies like CBT. ***Psychedelics are not like antidepressants ; can’t just pop a pill without work***

>6). To [@psybalazs](https://twitter.com/psybalazs), [@RCarhartHarris](https://twitter.com/RCarhartHarris) credit, they did prove that some individuals are clearly delusional. Some report feeling ‘high’ and having a better week when they actually got a placebo. And it’s hard to know when someone is delusional or is really benefiting from psychedelics

I’m a reasonably seasoned tripper, although I haven’t tripped for a good 8 months now. Since my last trip I’ve had a real downward turn and have been experiencing very frequent anxiety and panic attacks. I am considering microdosing to help this as I have some GT’s and I don’t think I am mentally prepared for a genuine trip at the moment.

I’ve never microdosed - my concern is that a microdose would play out along the same timeline as a big trip, 2 hours of anxiety followed by 4 hours of positivity. Im worried that a microdose could set me off on a panic attack during the early stages.

Anyone have any experience with this?

Anyway she has been a long time wine drinker and decided enough was enough.

After her 3rd day of microdosing she realized that she hadn't even thought of her wine and now she is continuing her program and couldn't be happier.

I took 1/4 of a gel tab. Was able to go to work and felt absolutely amazing. Information was so easy to process. Everything looked amazing. Especially outside. I also used it to aid in suboxone withdrawal. Took Clonazepam well clear of the microdose on either end of the dose. Also took 1 to 2 15mg Adderall ir's a day depending on work and if I had to do stuff during the day. I work overnights. But I've been thru every kind of opiate/opoid withdrawal. Nothing will ever touch fent. Did it cold turkey and it was hell. Also switched up days microdosing shrooms as well through the worst part of the sub withdrawal. 10/10 would recommend. Ask me anything I'm here to help. 8 months clean from opiates and Crack. Now off subs 10 days. Feeling great. Also got my testosterone checked today.

2023-05-11 10:25:16,My initial experience with microdosing,"I got my hands on some pre made 0.2 capsules of koi samui. I have scales so I double checked the correct dosage. My intention for MDing was to become a happier person, reduce my anxiety & irritability. I spaced my doses out so 3x per week e.g Saturday, Monday & Wednesday. 

0.10- Took in the morning on an empty stomach & went for a walk after. Felt nothing at all except tiredness.
0.14- Took in the morning after eating & felt nothing again except very sleepy. 
0.2 - Took in the morning with food, felt nothing but was incredibly tired.

The next morning after a 0.2 dosage, I could barely get out of bed & felt very groggy, with brain fog. I kept mixing up my words & could barely focus. 

I think I might try taking it before bed or taking it in the day and upping the dosage. I know it’s trial & error I guess, but I read about others having such great experiences on low doses - so I wonder why I’m not feeling any mental effects.

The TLDR is, Should I wait until I have nothing going on with those serotonin receptors before going deep into microdosing or are they not affected by the other drugs like a macro dose would be? My attempts at low macros have been pretty bunk so far.

I was clean for 6 months but now back on the kratom. I really dont want to do another 'flood' dose of ibogaine, (that shit is miserable) so was wondering if micro dosing Iboga would be an alternative? Also, the post acute withdraws are what drag me back into using kratom, I have no energy & feel like a lazy POS so start using again to get work done.

2023-05-10 09:42:14,1 Month Review Microdosing 1P LSD,"Hello everyone. First I will apologies for my bad English, but it isn\`t my native language. I\`ll try my best to be understood.

I did microdose for a month (10 cycles), 7 ug with 1P LSD following this protocol: 1 day microdose, 2 days off, the 4th day microdose again.  From the beginning I can say that I felt more grounded, contemplative, opened and empathic. Almost all of the times, the next day I had the afterglow effect, and I felt energized with a general mood of being content, optimistic and being friend with.. the concept of joy. 

I realized  I had more initiative in starting new activities, projects, I started searching more for events on FB, going on mountain hikes every weekend . Most important, my previous general feeling of being engulfed when I was speaking with someone new has vanished or diminished considerably.

On microdose days my sleep was affected in the sense that I had some trouble falling asleep but nothing serious. I always microdosed first thing in the morning.

Another important aspect that I noticed is that somehow, to some extent, sometimes I had this kind of new patterns of thinking, metacognitions maybe, especially when I was contemplative, walking in nature. I also notice that I begin to be reconnected with some old traits of behaviour as in I begun to be more playful and spontaneous in talking with people. I also noticed a remarkable connection that I had with my 3 years old nephew, playing and having fun. Everything was natural and easygoing.

From the sexual point of view I had this subjective feeling of a diminished libido, even thou the orgasms itself were somehow more intense.

Overall I say it was a good experience, nothing spectacular but definitely something to be remembered and repeated. (I didn\`t do this because I needed it - no depression, no anxiety)",33,1827,6,313,0

I would like to keep it to 1-2 drink.

So my purpose to MD is to extend my feel good Time without having to knock myself out with alcohol. BUT, i do love wine and i wish i could appreciate both…

I'm an experienced passionate Psychonaut who can differentiate even the tiniest difference in bodily sensation and effect on my mind. But, this trip felt like it was only 20% effective compared to my previous 1x LSD trip.

Should I consider this as any of the following?

1. Microdosing built tolerance towards LSD.
2. Bad/less potent LSD Blot.
3. Less energy in body.

On my dosage day (0.17-0.20g of golden teacher shrooms) I often feel quite lethargic and a bit dead mentally - not really interested in making conversation with others and feeling overall pretty quiet. 

However the day after I feel incredible. So much energy and focus, I feel sharp mentally and my mood is pretty good. 

Is this normal? Is there a way I can counteract the negative feelings on my dosage day? 

Taking a lower dose isn’t really any option to explore, as I tend to not feel much of anything if I go below 0.17g",29,597,5,108,0

2023-05-09 16:10:42,First time microdosing today.,"So I took my first capsule well, have a capsule 0.1 and felt pretty good for a good 4 hours then felt it subsiding…I came to the realisation a few weeks back that I have OCD and I don’t have compulsions such as cleaning hands or such. 

But I constantly ruminate over ruminating from being young if that makes sense. I’m dwelling on something from way back that I can’t let go. Yet when I try to think hard about what the actual fear and thought is…I’m lost and can’t find anything. I tell myself there’s no threat but yet I still ruminate.

That being said for that little brief window I felt quite at peace with it. And that for me is enough. I can see that over a period of time by sticking to a protocol such as 6 months I would see a difference. The provider I got my Shrooms from says on the packet 2 days on 1 day off. I’m not sure what other people’s opinions are. But now that I have taken the plunge, should I stick with the packet or do what my body feels right with?

2023-05-08 22:10:50,Microdosing lsd to help fix my brain,"So I’m going to start this out by saying that for the majority of my life I have had pretty severe anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder and I’ve tried therapy along with multiple different types of medications and meditation and journaling (journaling helps a decent bit for getting things out of thought loops but that’s about it) as well and none of it really seemed it help no matter how much I stuck with routines or any of it. I felt hopeless

Well, time goes by and I had already tried acid three times by this point and it was my favorite of the large list of drugs I had tried but I still didn’t use it often as I was worried of the dangers it could bring to my bipolar disorder in terms of throwing me into psychosis or something along those lines yet I have not had that happen to this day. Now I’ve done it around 15 times and one of those was the best drug induced experience I’ve had in my life and so far the most “I was in the presence of god” or any of them as well. 

On my mental illnesses: I’ve dealt with general anxiety and panic disorder for the vast majority of my life but mostly when I was in lower elementary grades and high school as in the mornings when I’d arrive at school I would have a panic attack nearly every day and have to go to the bathroom and just wait it out. In junior high I began smoking weed because I knew it could help and it did for a while but then it just stopped helping as much even after two month tolerance breaks and such. Now depression is definitely and always has been very much so helped by weed and I will stand by that until the day I die. Without weed I wouldn’t shower every day or brush my teeth or care about the cleanliness of my room or anything like that, I can do those things on my own but weed definitely helps manage when needed (not all day every day). With my bipolar disorder I deal with mania and weed lessens the symptoms of that as well and I have psychosis occasionally which I pretty much just have to deal with but that’s okay and then delusions from that which are quite intense and I won’t get into them but they have caused the most problems for me and the issue is I know they’re delusions but I can’t figure out how to stop them and now here’s where the acid comes in. 

I decided that I was going to do 4 days of micro dosing with 3 days in between each so I did Monday, Friday, Tuesday, Saturday  and each day I took 56.25mcg along with meditating some and playing guitar/ singing and writing and learning by reading or watching a podcast that I enjoy from someone named lex Friedman who I highly recommend checking out if you have not already, I also threw some rogan in there haha. Went for a walk one or two of the days but the others it was raining unfortunately. The first day I noticed with my delusions that I was able to stop and realize it was a delusion and then deconstruct it and understand where it was coming from which sent me into a whole introspective thought pattern about why and where it was coming from which has so far helped get rid of them a bit because I worked with that each of the other three days as well. 

In terms of anxiety, well fuck I haven’t had any ounce of panic since before I did those four days and it’s made me cry happy tears because it’s been so long since I’ve had a whole day without at least one minute of panic. I haven’t been really worried about much either which has helped in general. 

Depression seems nonexistent now honestly and there isn’t really much else to say about that 

Aside from the things I was going into it wanting to work on, another thing that came out of it is a new view on the world and the people and things in it. The profound realization of connectedness makes you obvserve life so much differently. It made me more aware also of each individual persons overly complex life just as my own. It made me realize that even animals and every other life form is profoundly complex yet all working and living in some sort of harmony having a job to keep the other things alive in this big cycle of life but it also added to my already outside view on everything. I tend to view everything happening as if I’m disconnected from all of it which is due to the dissociative disorder that I have but that isn’t to prominent all the time and d it makes me see things with a very outside view and think through things as if I’m watching everything happen in a move but I’m also a character in it and I’m watching myself, sort of like an out of body experience but just in my thinking. 
I will say as well, this is debated but coming from a musician I can almost fully, 100% say that I feel and have been more creative since having microdosed. I get more new ideas for guitar and I sing differently more and try new creative things more often as well as just seeming to have an expanded sense of general creativity. 

Overall I believe that this was probably one of the best decisions that I have ever made and I feel more free mentally than I ever have before, I feel like a kid again but with the knowledge and a intellect of an adult and I feel even more inclined to learn than I did before which is awesome because I love learning and I feel more inclined to be in nature which is also awesome because before I was stuck inside and now I get out more, social anxiety has been better as well so jamming have hung out with friends and texted them again and that’s cool but yeah overall it was a great idea and experience and thank you for reading if you made it this far",36,5526,7,1067,0

2023-05-08 19:35:25,Small achievement getting my son off anti depressants,"My son has been on Cipralex, (Escitalopram 20mg) for 3 years.  Really want to get him on a more natural route.  He's done some recreational shrooms these past few weeks.  Today he decided to skip his meds and take 1gram golden teacher. (He's done a 3gram before with not much effect. Microdoses of 500mg also very little effect).  Think from taking the meds that the effect of shrooms aren't that huge. He feels great today and had some visuals.  

I'm scared of weaning off too fast.  I was thinking one day on meds, next day shrooms at 500mg every second day. 

He uses weed to help him sleep at night (he has Aspergers and doesn't produce natural melatonin).

Any advice on how to go about weaning off his meds and onto shrooms as medication?

Edit:. Thanks for all the comments. I hear you all loud and clear and will let him talk to his doctor. I cannot as he is of age to make his own medical decisions.  Psilocybin is illegal and I doubt he would get the support he needs.  His doctor sees him for 30 mins every 6 months to redo the prescription.  Not nearly enough time to really make sure how he is doing. No other therapy involved.  I would say that it's rather dangerous to prescribe a medication that has such a large effect with so little effort from the medical ""professional"".

2023-05-08 16:43:12,MD'ing + Alcohol bad interaction/flashback?,"I've been microdosing with around 70-100 mg psilocybin 3-4 times a week for the past month or so with incredible results, specifically with regards to depression/suicidal thoughts, connection with others, general mood and energy levels, etc.

This weekend I went out with some friends and had a couple nights of heavy drinking (which I usually don't do these days), and mixed in roughly the same dose of psilocybin on both nights (I usually take in the morning). Very subtle, but boosted the night in a very fun way. I was making friends left and right, and spreading the good word about my MDing experience. Unfortunately, my alcohol tolerance is not what it used to be and I definitely pushed it a bit too hard.

Next day I was driving back home (about a 3.5 hour drive from where I was) and felt the usual subtle afterglow plus a moderate hangover. I had a big breakfast, but nothing since, and had a decent amount of coffee. Soon my energy levels started dropping, and I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous. I took a few puffs of weed to try to level out which did not work.

Soon my perception of time and movement started to shift. I kept looking at the GPS to see how much time I had left in the drive, and it was like time wasn't passing at all. I was listening to a podcast and couldn't understand half of it.

I kept trying to push through but eventually felt it was unsafe to drive and pulled off the highway. I became extremely disoriented, couldn't really understand what was going on, so I called my brother who was close enough and I was able to navigate to his house.

What followed was three hours of extreme sensitivity, confusion, and at one point felt something close to a full on ego death, like a full trip. I felt waves of understanding followed by complete confusion and terror and physical illness. I felt like I was dying and withered and old and fully accepted it (I'm almost 29). Everything was too much. I felt completely selfless, floating, like I was nobody and everything was new and unfamiliar. It was a beautiful day and I felt so much love and beauty, and I feel very grateful that I could spend some time with my bro and his wife and dog and they could help me out.

Eventually I was able to pull myself together and finish the drive home, but as the evening came of everything felt just horribly unfamiliar and terrible. I tried to sleep but every time I turned the lights off, I felt like there was no light left in the world. Nothing I could do would comfort me.

As of now, the day after, and maybe 40 hours after the most recent dose/drinking. I still feel pretty raw, constantly nauseous and dizzy, and like I can't find comfort in anything. I didn't sleep much, kept waking up with terrible anxious thoughts, and everything still feels like too much. I'm forcing myself to eat some food, but I'm not hungry at all. I hope this will fade and I'll find normal again after a couple days (definitely taking a break from dosing) but I'm just curious about why this happened. It was like a full on trip kicked in almost 24 hours after an extremely small dose.

I'm guessing with all the drinking and everything I just completely shocked my seratonin system or something. Of course alcohol is a terrible drug and there's a chance that two nights of heavy drinking for an infrequent drinker might do this on its own. I certainly pushed my limits, and learned from it, and will probably stick with MDing in the morning vs recreational/late night use in the future, but I've never had this kind of reaction, least of all with such a huge time delay and such a small dose. Certainly the THC and caffiene may have played a role (although I haven't noticed any other such bad interactions thus far), as well as sleep deprivation.

No set schedule, just doing intuitive microdosing when I feel the time is right. I used to do some macro trips back in college, 25+ years ago and always had a good experience. Psilocybin has been decriminalized where I live so I can legally obtain it from a dispensary. I’ve gotten these grand capsules that are .25 and I can take one and go to work without thinking twice about it. I’ve noticed that for a couple of days afterwards I’ve felt absolutely fantastic, just a brilliant relaxed mood. I will catch myself obsessing over something beautiful, but it’s not really awkward or weird, just a heightened sense of awareness. I’ve also noticed that it opens a door for whatever emotional need I have to enter. Like if I’ve been searching for a solution to a problem, it enables me to untangle the issue and move forward.

My parents are very open to experiences and two weekends ago I microdosed with my mom on a rainy Saturday. Dad declined to microdose with us just in case anything happened and we needed a control person present, but he’s interested in doing it another time. I hadn’t been sleeping well that week and about an hour after we took our doses, I got excited about these beautiful glass paperweights they have on the windowsill and then I fell asleep for two hours. So I found the rest that I needed. Mom felt nothing and was relaxing all afternoon. Nothing bad, nothing notable. Here’s the issue. She’s 76 and had a cancer scare this year that is hopefully behind us. She had some wild dreams the night after microdosing about herself becoming old and useless. She told me about it the next day and I guess she has had those dreams a lot over the last couple of years, but these were particularly vivid. I feel terrible that she’s having them in the first place, but worse that I gave her something that amplified them.

I’m not really sure what I’m asking to discuss here, but I guess… Has anyone else microdosed with an elderly parent and had a similar (or disimilar) experience? I love my parents and have been really upset about my mom’s mortality (and I suppose my own, by extension) ever since. My parents are amazing and I’m so grateful to share this with them, but should I not be doing this with them? We checked all medication interactions and that sort of thing before, and my dad actually talked to their doctor, who is a good friend, beforehand to make sure they would be physically safe.

2023-05-07 14:09:10,Report : Microdosing shrooms works in a mysterious way,"I have been microdosing shrooms for while now. There is something about them that leave you with some intuitive guiding . like i start eating very healthy and excercising without even take a conscious decision to do that. you just find yourself doing stuff. you automatically start to become mindful about your action. you try to connect with people in real life instead of being disconnected on your phone. i have addictive personality. today i wanted to do drugs, i ended up throwing all the drugs that i have in my house. i find myself writing this post only because I think it may benefit you guys. Even it doesn't bring me anything, i have the feeling there is a real person behind other end who reads that and might find this helpful. i find myself consuming less media, less socially programmed, and trust myself and my community more. One other thing is the shift in mindset, from dualistic to non-dualistic thinking. Instead of trying to become, you end up being. Good and bad things happens no expectation. From experience, obsession with egoic image/ sociatel success/ achieving goals not only it is counterproductive but can actually worse things more.
  
   
The dose is everything: 
  
i have taken psychedelics before in high doses. i would advice away anyone from doing that. while you may end up with really interesting/pleasurable experience, you may elso end up with very bad and scary experiences which will be counterproductive. I think this how these plants should be used. Quantity is indeed not quality in that situation. From experience, all what you can achieve with high doses, you can achieve with microdosing but with full safety and without disconnected from reality. Overdosing is real. you don't see people drinking 12 cup of coffee/beer at once because it is a ""heroic dose"". chasing pleasure or novelty with these substances will lead into multiple good experience then a bad experience.",54,1921,9,321,0
2023-05-07 14:06:30,Questions about Second cycle after one year,"Hello dear community, I have a few questions that I would be happy if you could answer for me. 

A little over a year ago, I did about 7 weeks of MD psilocybin to treat a mental problem I was going through, and I had an excellent experience, thank God! 
I got to the point where I can go on without them so I stopped taking them, everything was perfect , started working out a lot and got back to work and to a full life and joy .
now after a year I had a sugar crash at the gym terrible experience .
All the medical tests came out fine and I don't have any health problems, but still after what happened I have been at home for a whole month without strength and unable to work or exercise .

And a feeling of trauma and pressure in the body that doesn't release since the sugar drop, literally every little effort brings back a high pulse and a feeling of imbalance, even though all the medical tests are normal, so I think it's a mental problem of trauma to the body and I believe that the mushrooms can help release it

feel that some of the symptoms I had in the past are returning because of this
and I wanted to know if it is okay to do another cycle without any worries . 

Some of the symptoms that I feel have returned and I really want to get rid of them and I know that the mushrooms have helped me in the past are: 
Feeling confused 
tiredness 
lack of focus 
lack of strength 
Improvement in the sense of self and mental strength

So I'm actually asking, has anyone here experienced something similar? 
that after a certain period he felt that some of the symptoms were returning and that he needed to do another round on mushrooms? 

And did you get what you wanted the second time as well?

Thank you for your patience and I look forward to the answers",43,1768,7,342,0

2023-05-06 19:27:42,If one mushroom makes me depressed will they all?,"Experimented for the first time over the last few weeks with “Blue Meanie”. Usually spaced it out every other day although in the beginning I did 3 in a row. Recently we were travelling so I left it at home, but tried it again when we got back.

All of this to say: I’ve noticed that I experience bouts of depression every single day I’ve microdosed.

I’m familiar with depression having suffered since childhood, and I’m familiar with its tones and waves, the way it moves. But this was a very different kind - like the cloud was being artificially imposed, steady and even and heavily tinged with cynicism towards others.

Anyway it was never like that before, never like that on off-days, and often cleared out in the evening if I napped. So I think it’s safe to blame the Blue Meanie.

Is this common? Should I expect similar reactions with other types of shrooms? Should I expect BIG depression if I were to take a big dose of the Blue Meanie?",49,948,9,173,0

from what i gather, TSA is looking for weapons, bombs etc, not drugs (not that they wouldnt seize anything they find i'm assuming) - but i'm wondering if i could stash a few week's worth of microdoses into a melatonin bottle or something, if that'd look suspicious/set off any alarms? the melatonin capsules that come in the bottle usually look nearly identical to my md capsules.

i'm guessing they won't have any psilocybin detectors or anything LMAO, shrooms dont give off any scent either (esp inside a capsule inside a bottle inside my bag) so i'm not super worried abt sniffer dogs, but i wanna be as careful as possible (if my idea's even feasible?)

I took the dose 3 days ago and figured it wouldn’t make much of a difference, but it hit me a lot harder than I expected. Like uncontrollable sobbing, tingling feelings, distorted vision, dizziness etc. I’ve read enough from this sub to know that means the dosage was way too strong for me - so I just tried to ride it out and feel the emotions.

Does  artificial psilocybin get broken down when frozen within water?

2023-05-04 20:00:49,Questions About MDing LSD vs Shrooms,"Hey all, long post inbound. 

I've been lurking in this sub for a while and I still haven't settled on which substance to MD. I have access to both, a few vials of LSD @ \~13ug per ml & some 250mg capsules of psilocybin. 

Just for some background, I have around 60 LSD macrodoses under my belt and 5 on shrooms. I find that acid tends to make me more socially awkward - and the one time I *accidentally* tripped while working, I basically became completely useless for 3 hours. Mushrooms have given me strong nausea every single time but I feel a lot more relaxed, and able to communicate better. Obviously microdosing has very very different effects to macrodosing, but given that they are still the same compound, could this be any indication to how MDing could affect me? 

From what I understand, psilocybin tends to help out with general depression, social interactions, creativity, etc. But can cause anxiety, irritability and isn't so good for getting things done. LSD helps out with productivity and getting into a flow state more often. 

Does anyone have any anecdotal experience with these effects crossing over? (e.g. increased social ability/irritability on LSD *or* a better day-to-day working experience on shrooms). Further to this, has anyone experienced any other effects that I haven't mentioned from either compound - positive or negative?

My personal preference would be whichever would help me become more productive day-to-day and get less distracted, as I often find myself experiencing symptoms of ADD while working. I've tried stimulants (Ritalin/Concerta to be specific) once and that made an impressive difference with regard to staying on task, but for obvious reasons I don't want to be taking stimulants everyday or even semi-regularly. I rarely ever find myself in a depressive state, nor do I suffer from general anxiety - but interacting with people can be a challenge sometimes.

**TL;DR - I need to be able to focus on work, but I'm also terrible at interacting with people. Which is better?**",36,2031,6,338,0

Last year while tapering off Effexor I attempted to microdose to help with the taper. I ended up stopping because I felt like it would be more beneficial to do it once I’m off Effexor. Well I stopped taking Effexor in December but went through Protracted Withdrawals at the end of January. It got pretty rough so I ended up reinstating Effexor unfortunately. 

I think I’d like to go ahead and add microdosing along with my Effexor to help heal, and eventually get off the Effexor again.

2023-05-03 10:43:00,Some questions about starting a microdose regime,"Hello! I am an experienced psychedelic user with probably over 50 macrodose trips with various psychedelics (psylocibin, lsd, 2-cb, dmt, harmala alcaloids). I have no experience with microdoses and wanted some info. I know this probably is answered in the faqs but the sheer amount of information is overwhelming so i tought to ask directly here. Let's start

Regarding tolerance: i plan to use lsd to microdose. As you know lsd tolerance takes more or less a full month to go to 0 (more like 2 weeks but to be safe i usually wait a month). Can i start the microdose regime while still having a tolerance or is it better to wait? Also, if i want to macrodose sometime, i will probably need more than my usual dose to get the same effects if i microdose often right? Plan to go with the original Fadiman protocol.

Regarding dosage: i unfortunately don't have access to crystal lsd or blotters with a know dosage. What i have right now i estimate to be around 60-80 ug per blotter based on comparative experiences with other psychs. Do i understand correctly that i can soak my blotters in distilled water and use the water to have consistent dosing? Can every lsd analog be soaked in water like 1v or ald etc?

2023-05-02 22:52:05,I’m new here (: “Drop Personal History”,"
The guide appears when the student is ready. 

A cousin recently recommended me a book, “Journey to Ixtlan” by Carlos Castaneda, I’d never heard about it, probably because it was written in the 60s & my parents weren’t even born yet, but the book couldn’t have found me at a better time. 

In the non-fiction story, Carlos, a recent college graduate in the field of archeology, is on a mission to write about the Peyote plant & its rituals. Soon he finds his guide, a Yaqui Indian, Don Juan Matus, who tells him there’s nothing to learn about the Peyote plant, & guides him on a self discovery journey, at first, without the use of psychedelics. Later in the story we find out that Peyote and other sacred plants can be used to reach altered states of perception which can provide lessons beyond those we can perceive in everyday life, especially if that everyday life is routine. 

One quote of the book in particular hit me hard, & brought me to this community. 

“You haven’t finished anything because of the sense of disproportionate importance that you attach to yourself”. 

Ouch. I know I’m not alone, if you’re reading this, you probably live a life labeled by others as “their dream life“, but no matter what others say, it never feels ENOUGH, because you know you are capable of MORE. 

I was humbled by this quote, because it led me to recognize the following: it is the disproportionate importance I attach to myself that never allows me to feel fully satisfied, like I never finish because there’s always more to do and I must “Drop My Personal History”, that history which was drilled in at 9 years old when I first heard the word Opportunity.

My name is Eddie, when I was 9 years old I cried a lot because I was forced to leave my life behind in Mexico & start a brand new one with my family in a small town of North Carolina. Moving sucked, but worse was not speaking a word of English, getting picked on & crying all the way home from school every day begging my parents to take me back to Mexico, where honestly we weren’t rich, but lived comfortably. My parents always said “NO, because in the USA will you have the OPPORTUNITY to live a life you will never be able to live in Mexico.” The word OPPORTUNITY stuck with me, & my mission became to squeeze the juice out of Every Opportunity I came across, so by 20 I was the top call center insurance agent for State Farm nationwide. By 24, I was #1 for Wells Fargo’s Bilingual mortgage division nationwide. By 27, I bought a Ferrari & in everybody’s eyes “I had made it.” Everybody’s eyes except for mine because I still had this sense of disproportionate importance that would never allow me to feel like I FINISHED. 

“Some egos were harmed in the making of this message” 

Don’t forget to “Drop Your Personal History” in the comment section.

Just a quick disclaimer: I am based in Australia and work for an organization involved in the rollout of psychedelic therapy here. As the use of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes is becoming legalized in some cases, I am currently evaluating different platforms to identify communities with a higher percentage of individuals struggling with challenging and confusing psychedelic experiences.

While support networks like social media groups can be helpful, they may not always provide the assistance needed for vulnerable individuals. As someone who is part of several organizations working to address this issue, I want to make my availability known in this forum.

Please note that I am not looking to profit from the support I provide here, and I do not charge for crisis assistance. (However, my specialized services are available for paying clients.)

What I would like to offer is a direct line to support and guidance for those who feel they are in need of help.

In this forum, I can provide high-level support and troubleshooting. If you require urgent assistance, please visit my website, which you can find in my profile.

I want to participate in life more. 

So now here we are in May and I haven’t taking a dose for seven days. I’ve been experimenting with doses which is hard AF with a day or two off sometimes three days. But this seven day break was the first aside from the other seven day break I had back in late February.

Doses usually range from 250mgs to 500mgs on dose days. I did take 1g like twice but that’s as far as I went.

Here’s the issues I suffer from GAD, CPTSD and MDD with anxiety leading the pact.. lol

The problem is trying to control my cortisol levels due to the anxiety (independent of me it seems) when trying to heal myself from shrooms.

I took 200mg 3-4 days per week, often with lions mane. And my depression shrank. Then disappeared. I felt good for the first time in forever.

Slowly, bad habits crept back up, depression returned.

2023-04-30 19:35:46,does this sound like my dose is too high?,"the effects i’ve noticed after dosing are:

- sleepy, want to nap
- yawning a lot
- feeling kind of out of it but not tripping or high, just a bit off and spaced out in a not entirely pleasant way

taking pure psilocybin capsules at 0.2g, have only done it twice so far, both days i went for a nap pretty soon after taking it as i soon felt really tired. tried to do some gardening the second time and felt pretty spaced out. the reason i wanted to ask before reducing the dose is i’ve seen some conversation here about whether you’re supposed to actually ‘feel’ the effects of a microdose or not. i’ve tripped on full doses of shrooms before and it wasn’t like that. it was only pretty slight and wore off after i went to sleep for a bit, but should i be aiming for no discernible difference from total sobriety? i’m 90% sober after having had addiction problems in the past (my psychedelic experiences have all been good and i allow myself occasional dips into things that have never been habit forming for me) and i don’t enjoy the feeling of being a ‘tiny bit high’. i think i was hoping just for sobriety with, slightly better vibes? improved mood, better access to my feelings or more mindfulness? think that’s vaguely what i was hoping for but idk.

not sure if i should just carry on with the capsules with some days in between and see if the effects level out, or reduce the dose (also that just seems fiddly to do wit  capsules? not sure how to to store the loose shroom dust til my next dose?)

So let me say that i did a lot of preperation, this involved doing good research on microdosing. Choosing wich protocol to go with (fadiman) and setting intentions. 
My intentions were: being less angry, have less cptsd flashbacks and having a clearer mind.
Now mind you i did a lot of work on myself before i started this (2 years). And i have come a long way but i also still have a long way to go.
I cant seem to get rid of my flashbacks and ander, and i see the abbility of creating New pathways in the neurons in my brain that psilocybine has a helping hand. So how did yesterday go? I was a lot calmer and a lot less angry, my partner said this also. I saw more of the beauty in nature and i wasnt scared to say what i thought for the first time in my life.
But i was myself, in the morning i was a bit out of it but the rest of the day i had a clear mind and i could function even better then normal. I didnt ruminate at all. Today the anger is back a bit, but im still calmer. I love this stuff and im ready to go forward with working on myself with this as a helping hand and normal therapy as my Guide.

My mood is still crap, anxiety still taking over my life and I’m generally feeling very deflated from this lack of improvement. I’ve read endless success stories of others, people reporting improvement in their moods and life in general in as little as a day or two?

To my surprise my muscles totally relax when I take MDMA (I have no idea why?) it makes penetrative sex much more comfortable and much more doable -(sorry for the sexual content here)- but in MDMA I can take bigger dicks and I can also do double penetration, which for me is insane, because in my normal state if I wear a buttplugg I can barely put a finger in my vagina with out pain. 
Because of this hugh difference I experience in my muscles I have started to think if I could microdose MDMA or any other drug to get this effect. Most forums advice tho not microdose MDMA.

2023-04-30 00:49:23,Started microdosing for major depression - My depression has been in remission for 10 days!,"Some background. Major depression, traditional anti-depressants didnt helped and in fact made things worse for me. I've been depressed for 15 years, the last 3 being the worst. Hit rock bottom and almost took a self inflicted bullet back in December after a night of drinking and decided it was time to save my life and get help. I would fantasize about my death every single day even though I couldn't take my own life. I was dedicated on reducing my life span and was working on it.

I started my microdose regiment on the 20th with 1 100mg capsule in the morning, it just happened to be on 4/20, it wasn't planned. I took it around 8am with my vyvanse. If I really looked for it, i think i felt a little more chill but didn't notice much until 8-10 hours later. When the mushrooms would have been wearing off, I felt happy. I didn't have an ounce of depression. Granted, it was a beautiful 4/20 in CA. I decided to take my good mood and grill out for the girl and I.

I woke up early the next day to cook breakfast (hadn't happened in a long time). My girl was actually surprised because depression has had me absolutely worthless in the mornings. 4/21 was the first day in years that I wasn't depressed. That night I felt a little sadness coming back so figurd I'd move to 2 capsules the following day. I actually didn't notice anything my 2nd time when I took them. But my depression was still gone

I was going every other day the first 3 doses then went to one of the traditional methods with a 2 day break in between. I had moved to 3 capsules on my 3rd dose since I'd be taking an extra day off, I was worried about my depression coming back. I made the mistake of taking the same amount not taking into account the tolerance reset day (day 2 off) and noticed myself getting anxiety a lot easier than normal. I'm starting to realize less is more when it comes to microdosing, at least for me. I will be staying at 1-2 capsules every other day and will be working towards a set schedule of 2 days off in between (as long as that seems like it works best)

I'm still trying to figure out what's best for me. The quality of life in my head is a night and day difference. Mushrooms aren't a long term thing for my depression. I want to get in for Spravato or Ketamine Infusion therapy and see if I can use it as a tool to make the changes necessary in my head.

For now I will take enjoying life again. My best friends,  significant other, family, and everyone around me notices a huge improvement. I've been cooking meals almost daily and have been able to spend more time playing with my dog.",91,2599,15,494,0

I got a half oz of blue meanies and I tested them out by eating 0.25g my first go. Very weird/bad experience. 
Set and setting were fine, it was a Sunday morning and I was at home relaxing around watching some tv, nice sunny day out.

2023-04-28 22:00:41,Heeelp please!!,"Hi, 

&#x200B;

I just harvested and dried my first flush and I am so excited to start microdosing. 

The thing is I bough the ""00"" size capsules and wanted to try the stamets stack and from what I read the ""00"" capsules could hold up to 700mg.

&#x200B;

I therefore mixed together:

3,6 g dried mushroom

7,2 g lions mane

4,8 g niacin 

&#x200B;

And my math was dividing those numbers by 24 (which is how many capsules my capsule maker holds) and i also go it to add up to 650mg.   


To my suprise it did not fit the capsules and i instead had to make 46 capsules.  


SO my question now is, was my math just trash and can I now instead take 2 capsules to get my original target of 0,15 g shroom microdose?",15,711,2,137,0
2023-04-28 17:57:41,24 Things That Helped My Addiction," So I wrote a Reddit post here a couple of days ago after microdosing LSD for the first time in years. A person in the comments asked how I quit smoking so I thought I'd make a new post and share some thoughts and ideas!

It was a long process that required a lot of changes. Started smoking normal cigarettes at 18 + smoked weed on and off for the 2 coming years, then I was pretty much high every day for 4-5 years. Hopefully no matter what you're addicted to you'll get some good ideas!

Here is a link to the previous post if you want to read it before this one [https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/12tg3hg/i\_forgot\_how\_amazing\_microdosing\_lsd\_is](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/12tg3hg/i_forgot_how_amazing_microdosing_lsd_is)

Here is a list of different things that helped me. Maybe there is something here you can find value in!

1. It started with the macro dose that gave me perspective and an emotional understanding and an outlet. This made me care about my health and longevity in a way I never did before.
2. I had to dive deep into my mind to understand why I smoked, and what my future would look like if I continued vs if I didn't. I Kinda understood this before but now I felt it deep down in my core.
3. I had to find a way to be comfortable with just ""being"", what happens happens, eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired and have fun doing it. Life is reaaaally long if you're not having fun and being sober can actually be fulfilling. The zen way helped me a lot with this.
4. Finding something that you truly care about is a big key I think. Not kinda care because if it fell in your lap. I mean something that you will miss when you're dead. Something that makes you want to live until you're 100 years old, just so you can do this thing. To move the hearts and minds of men and women, think not of small things but of big things.  
If you don't have any evidence of the thing or action in your present life, then you probably don't care about it that much. For example, I like drawing but I have very little evidence of that in my life. If you give me a piece of paper, I will instinctively start to draw but I don't have a strong impulse to do it normally.
5. Shrooms/LSD did something with me. It gave me a huge impulse to start writing, it was like a vampire compelled me into doing this. I wrote whatever came into my mind and read it. The reflection that you see when you read what you've written might be totally different from what you believe and perceive deep down in your core.   
If there is an incongruence you will feel a desire to align yourself. No matter how crazy, cringy, or factual my ideas were, I still wrote them down. It gave me an ungodly amount of insight into my mind. Now I have written about 800k words and no one has read it. It was never meant for the public, only me. Nowadays I do consider publishing some of it.
6. On the previous note, I think it delving deep into death is a good thing that every human should do in their life.  
What does it truly mean to be dead? What will you miss and why do you consider death to be peaceful? How do you experience the world when you're dead? Can you hear any sounds? How does the world sound without any ear? Can you see any clouds or touch a loved one? How does the world look without any eyes? Do you really want to rush to that place? These are some things you can ask yourself. By trying to remove concepts, words, and sensory input we can experience a weird part of our mind.  
I like and find this idea to be very true ""If you haven't died, can you live a true and authentic life?"" We have so many barriers, blocks and beliefs in our mind that we are completely unaware of. They shelter us but they also make our lives less colorful and joyful. Life is born out of death, much like the antelope's agility shaped by the cheetah, or faith that evolves from doubt.  
To feel death deeply is a great fountain of joy, love, and it is a force that breaks boundaries. You just need to look at it with a bit of calamity. Death is the lens through which we understand our finite time in this limitless universe. If we understand that there is no guarantee for tomorrow, we'll be forced to live for today. Addiction came from yesterday, feeds on the today and ruins the tomorrow.
7. I accepted that I was addicted and couldn't stop given the reality I was currently occupying. So I had to change my reality by living in another. Yes, I'm a time traveler!!!!
8. I didn't want to become a totally sober person that went to AA or something for the rest of my life. I actually had a good, fun, and enlightening experience during this time and I want my memories to be intact, even if the perspective changes. So I wanted to find a way to use weed in a controlled responsible manner. This ruled a lot of my decisions.
9. Your mind plays this amazing trick on you all the time where it ""shortcuts"" your thoughts. You have tried to stop smoking so many times and instead of seeing that each time is a new attempt with new circumstances and possibilities.  
Eventually, your brain will shortcut this thought and just say, I can't stop smoking and you won't even try, do it haphazardly or you sabotage yourself. This is a great way for the brain to conserve energy I guess.  
Many people experience this phenomenon if they try something out and get shamed or laughed at, now they will never do it again for the rest of their life - aka if I do this action something negative will happen - a shortcut that doesn't requires a second thought. Microdosing can help with this part a lot as it loosens established thought patterns.
10. I didn't start with weed/cigarettes first because that would be hard, instead, I cut down on alcohol and drugs by 90% and eventually stopped more or less completely.
11. Being high and smoking occupied a lot of space in my life so I had to find other outlets and spaces to spend my time and energy in. LSD helped me get the motivation to work out for example. For a normal smoker, a cigarette can help them find calm in stressful situations for example. How are you going to fill this calm in stressful situations?
12. Chewingum, lots of chewingum...
13. Your willingness to do hard and challenging stuff is like a willpower muscle, going to the gym helped train this a bit. If I were to stop today I would probably start fasting and taking cold showers to train my mind and body.  
This would help train the willpower muscle even more, it would also help me to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Cold showers also boost dopamine and norepinephrine which makes you feel better. Fasting kinda becomes a spiritual thing.
14. I actually didn't rely on anyone when I quick weed/smoking. No support system. For most people, a support system is probably a healthy requirement. I think I take some level of satisfaction and pride in figuring things out myself and just doing them, rather than relying on others. I'm my own experiment that likes to research, plan and execute.
15. Understand that if you take a wrong step and take a puff or smoke, that's ok. It's not the end of the world, you just did a thing that is not in line with your values. You don't have to become a full-time smoker just because of it.  
By putting too much weight on our success, we might fall harder when we fail and we start to spiral. Live from each moment to the next, dawn will always come after dusk just as dusk will always come after dawn.
16. When shit hits the fan, remember why you're doing it. Go back in your mind and try to re-experience the day you decide to quit.
17. When it was time to actually stop weed/smoking I did edibles and came across microdosing. It's the smoking part that is really addicting to me, edibles are really low on the addiction scale for me. (tobacco + Hasch is really the only option where I live).  
I quit edibles when I felt ready and was 99% clean for a year. Since I focused mainly on the process of building myself up vs quitting weed, I could reintroduce EDIBLES in a healthy manner without problems. I didn't do edibles for the same reason I did before. Smoking is not good for your lungs and it kicks faster, which makes it easier for the brain to connect smoking with something positive that should be pursued.
18. I noticed that I always felt uneasy and twitchy when I didn't have any cigarette paper and weed at home, soon enough I was walking to the store and had a cigarette in my mouth before leaving the door.  
So I stashed it away in a place in the house that was hard to reach. This kinda gave me some reassurance and relief knowing that if I wanted to, I could get high within 10 minutes. This also helped build my willpower over time I think.
19. During the two years that lead up to this, I told myself every new year that I was going to have 1 month completely sober, except for the cigarettes. Which was a Commitment I managed to complete. Committing to a lifetime without weed was a scary thought.
20. I reduced contact with friends during my quit-smoking period. Many people can't stay in contact during this period or once they stop because of the temptation. Personally, I like my friends and wanted them to stay in my life so I had to find a way around that. What person would I need to be in order to achieve both of these things? Now it's zero problem.
21. Stop identifying as a smoker or user. That was in the past and you live in the now. If you want to, you can be mad, happy, or sad within 10 seconds, you don't actually need a good reason to be happy or mad. Why not be a healthy individual that understands that we're flawed human beings that deserve to live a good and rich life?
22. Addiction is a solution to a problem. When we look at problematic things we tend to equalize that to a problem or something that is morally wrong. This makes us approach a solution as a problem. That is just going to fuck with your thinking capabilities.  
If a person has social anxiety and solves that with alcohol, it might be problematic but the problem is gone. So what is your addiction solving for? If you can figure that out, then you're aware of the problem, if you're aware of the problem, then you can solve it in a creative way.  
If you have a kid or pet that's acting up all the time, that is not a problem, the behavior might be problematic but it's a solution for the kid/pet.
23. I had tried quitting sooooo many times, but this time I didn't want to feel any pressure, I wanted to do it my way. So as you can see I tailored my path extremely carefully and uniquely for me. I spent time observing my behavior and triggers and thought carefully about how to tackle them.  
If there is one thing I can tell you is that there is no ""one way of quitting"", many pieces of advice only help if you're walking on the same road. If it didn't work the last time, then you have to experiment. Acknowledge your individuality.
24. Instead of going cold turkey, which never worked. I had to build up my environment and core to ensure the success and outcome that I wanted.  
If you managed to read all this congratulations! Share the thoughts and ideas that helped you!",34,11169,6,2075,0

This medication is used for both migraines and seizures at different doses. I am working my way up now and have started on a dose of 25mg, 2x per day. 

Does anyone here have any experience with this medication either personally or through a friend/ family member while microdosing?  If so, have they had any adverse reactions? My Dr tells me this IS NOT an SSRI.

Also, 

I've been microdosing for a few months now, 3 on and 4 off. I've had burning headaches every day since January that go through different stages of intensity throughout the day. I thought microdosing was supposed to help migraines? Should I throw in a macrodose every now and again?

2023-04-28 13:19:45,MD saved my GFs Life.,"Disclaimer before you read my report:

Reading some of the reports can be discouraging and also increasing the expectations on your own experience. Nobody is the same, some people have positive effects with MDing, some don’t. Some have a great social infrastructure to get easier back on their feet and some have it way more difficult. So please don’t compare. This report should be a post to thank everybody and let others learn from the experience. 


My GF was at a real low some years ago. She talked about suicide a lot, was not able to function and couldn‘t really move out of the bed. She was crying constantly and it was an alarming situation. It was a time when I started researching MD for performance enhancing possibilities. I came across all the depression related topics and found out how microdosing Psilocybin can have positive effects on depression and anxiety. 

I started pitching her the idea of microdosing and she wanted to try it with me. She didn’t know that it could have positives effects on her mood or depression, I told her only the part where it could be beneficial for studying. The first two weeks we didn’t feel anything. We also didn’t know what to look for. We never took any psychedelics or something similar. So it was a new experience for us. 

After two weeks I could see dramatic changes on my GFs depression. She didn’t really noticed it, but I noticed that she wasn’t constantly crying anymore, wasn’t in bed all the time and stopped talking about suicide. I was so happy and it was a big relief! This experience also showed me why it’s really important to track your mood and do a diary, even if the changes are so big like hers, you don’t realize the improvement unless you are extremely self reflective. 

It’s important to note here that my GF was already in therapy and working a LOT on herself. So it was like the MD gave a little boost and made it easier to work on the mental health topics. There was a point where the therapist asked her if she would be willing to put herself in a mental hospital. After a couple of weeks MDing that topic didn’t come up again. Seems like the therapist also noticed some improvements. 

I know the title is very strong with saying MD saved her life, but it did in some way. MD will not save your life on its own, but it helped her being able to work on herself. It was the boost and mood change she needed. This is also very important to understand: she wasn’t relying on the MD. That’s why I didn’t tell her the mental benefits (she knows it now, but I didn’t tell her initially). It’s not a magic pill and not „reliable“ medicine for acute situations like hers.

I hope this inspires some users here and I want to thank the community for all the support and guidance ❤️

Edit: 

Since a lot of people asked, our dosage was 130mg at first and then we moved to 150mg.

We tried different frequencies in this following order:

- 4 days on, 3 off
- 3 days on, 4 off
- Mon/Thu on, rest off

My favorite was Mon/Thu on and rest off, since it felt like I got most of the effects, without building up short therm tolerance.",21,3102,5,571,0

2023-04-27 12:58:43,Measuring Actual Micro Doses,"Hello my friends, I'm on a quest to find the most efficient and accurate way to fill gel capsules. I'm currently using a Gemini-20 scale (0.001g accuracy) to measure powder in the 10-20mg range, and filling size 4 gel capsules - really small doses here. Personally, I fill the capsule first and deduct its weight; if a capsule weighs 0.035g I will fill it to 0.045g for a 10mg capsule.

The problem here is that not only is it somewhat inaccurate, but **remarkably** inefficient.

For me in particular, over or under pouring by even a couple milligrams would lead me to restart, it's pretty hard to even pour 10mg exactly. That leads to each capsule requiring a dedication of roughly 2-3 minutes, which doesn't sound like a lot, but when you're making in bulk... It could be, say, 10 hours of my week or more. Unironically. And I'm already quite busy...

I have been relentlessly searching for the ultimate solution to this problem. One idea that comes to mind is using a 'gel capsule filling machine', which allows you to fill multiple capsules to the same dosage at once. Here is a pretty reputable brand with a **demonstration video** for those who don't know how it works: [https://www.allincapsule.com/pages/how-to-use](https://www.allincapsule.com/pages/how-to-use) (this is great for anyone filling larger capsules).

However... this **does not** solve the problem. The smallest size capsule I'm able to find online is size 4, which already holds 10x the dosage I'm looking to fill (10-20mg), which means, to achieve a dose of 10mg in a capsule, I would have to fill perhaps 1/10th of that capsule to begin with. This machine fills practically the entire capsule. Not only that - the minimum capsule size is huge comparatively, so I would end up filling over **100x** the target dosage, even at the smallest size. This machine is only useful for those of us working with larger micro doses.

As I've been continuing to search for a real solution, I'm surprised by the lack of discussion I could find about this specific topic on the internet. It almost seems implausible without an actual scientific lab. I have to ask, has anyone here faced this problem? And does anyone have any ideas, even potential ideas on how I could come closer to a solution? Input is extremely appreciated.",28,2289,4,386,0

2023-04-27 00:00:28,Just took my first microdose!,"I am an avid self-developer and not new to psychedelics but am new to psilocybin. I did a series of ketamine treatments in 2021 that allowed me to experience just how powerful the healing can be. 

I am working through developmental trauma and trying to untangle my sense of identity from what was installed within me. 

I’ve made a lot of progress over the last year and a half. 

I’ve always felt like I would hit a wall with cognitive based therapies and with self help strategies and personal growth seminars and retreats. I felt this deep sense of something wasn’t clicking or something was deeply broken within me. 

I don’t know if that makes sense. Or resonates with anyone else. 

With ketamine, I could feel healing in its rawest form, on the nervous system level. This became my North Star and caused a deep shift to begin within me. 

I am hoping that microdosing psilocybin will help me re align with that knowingness on a visceral level. To continue on that journey of feeling ok, of feeling enough… to not constantly battle shame. 

I also know I drink too much. I’m fully functional for sure but I lean on it a little too much for nervous system regulation at the end of the day. I’m hoping that feeling of fulfillment and contentment will grow and I won’t have that constant inner itch that needs to be scratched…. One more mile to hike before I turn around, one more degree or certification and I’ll be good enough, 10 more pounds and I’ll stop feeling ashamed of my body… 

Like that feeling of “I’m enough” is always just around the corner, blocked in view by shame. 

This post might be pointless or maybe there’s someone out there who can relate. 

I’m tired of struggle. I work really hard. I am ready for breakthrough instead of constant threat of breakdown.

2023-04-26 05:11:40,In a Tough Spot,"So over the last few months, my life has kinda fallen apart.  I won't get into details but I need to get it back.  Years ago, I tried a bunch of SSRIs, which work for a time but all make me feel emotionally numb.  Lexapro was by far the best for anxiety, but it really was terrible to get off of.  Took me about a year.  I started taking wellbutrin today because I need the motivation to get things back on track and it doesn't seem to have the same emotional blunting effects as others given it's profile.  But I have a feeling in a month from now, I'm going to be feeling sped up, angry and irritable.  I could be wrong...

Alternatively, I've tried microdosing psilosibin in the past which helped quite a bit.  It seemed to heal my ""soul"" more than antidepressants which seemed like an artificial bandaid.  But having consistency getting the dosing right just creates too many variables.  Also, it doesn't seem to last long enough to get the job done at times.  I'm kind of torn between getting on Lexapro and Wellbutrin because I could see that being a great combo.  My brain is telling me to do that combo because I'll be happy enough to get things back on track but then I'll have to get off of them at some point most likely.  My heart is telling me to wellbutrin/microdosing or just microdosing on its own.

I've been microdosing 100mg psilocybin 1 day on/2 days off for a month and it's worked wonders for my social anxiety (it's pretty much gone).  It's helped my ADHD a little bit but nowhere near the effectiveness of a stimulant.

I decided to try switching to microdosing LSD (7ug) on Saturday and... Holy crap!  I cleaned my entire basement in 2 days.  It's been really bad for a number of years. I think I threw out around 30 garbage bags of stuff.  I finally have a nice living space again.

However, my mood felt more ""mechanical"".  I didn't feel very grounded, nor that social.  I made a list of things to do, and things got done.  Almost like a robot.

I decided to switch back to psilocybin today and I'm feeling a whole lot better.  I'm looking forward to enjoying the space that I cleaned over the weekend.

Is anyone else switching between psilocybin and LSD?  Maybe taking very low doses of each at the same time?   I'd love to have that focus integrated with the grounded feeling I'm getting.

2023-04-25 06:59:04,Microdose Report Day 14-20," 

INGESTION SCHEDULE:

During this whole period, I only microdosed once. That was two days ago. I bought a new scale and measured out 0.1g, and it turned out to be a bit more than what I’ve been taking. I ingested them, felt pre-trip disorientation, and fell asleep about one hour after. I think it was too much.

I plan on continuing the regular dosing schedule starting Wednesday since that is when my current job project is finished. I’ve always been a “feel it as I go” and highly aware type person, so adhering to schedules is tough, but I’ve had the best results sticking to predetermined schedules and forcing things if the time is due. 1 day on, 2 days off.

DAILY SYMPTOMS UPDATE:

My bodily-feeling anxieties are so much lesser now. Deep disturbing stomach/heart heavy feelings have lightened up, and my general mood is much more playful and explorative.

My thoughts are pertaining to newer things, rather than focusing on the same old problems or the past. I feel motivated for the future. I’ve been coding 2-4 hours a day.

My living spaces are clean. Day one I did a mass cleanup. Now, I hang up all my coats at the end of the night, and never leave a dirty dish on a table. I’ve always lived in the remnants of my trash for weeks, so this is nice.

Appetite is much more consistent. I’m always hungry when I do things, and not hungry when I don’t. Before, there would be days where I wouldn’t want to eat, and most of my food was consumed at night. This goes hand in hand with my “stomach happiness”. I’m thinking it has something to do with the serotonin receptors in the gut. I have noticed myself craving junk food way more, which I hated sweets for years so this is weird. Been buying a lot of candy.

ABSTRACT THOUGHTS:

The biggest problem I made as a teenager is thinking that I’m special, and above common sense. This led to psychedelics and finding “flaws” in society. This made society seem like a fools joke, or trap. This disconnected my will to integrate, which put me years behind my peers, and made me a manbaby in denial.

Work! the system right and you will be rewarded. Thinking your special is a handicap to action. Thinking you’re special while using a fuck ton of drugs and living with your parents is even more stupid.

Don’t think you’re special. There’s always someone bigger and stronger and smarter than you anyways. Find your place, honestly accept it, and start building.

I’ve had 4-5 skyscrapers but all of them had shitty foundations so they all crashed.

That’s the only thing that keeps me motivated. Knowing that the collapse was my fault, but I ignored all the codes thinking my building is unique.

I know I need to go slow and build a solid foundation. It takes time, but it’s worth it.

You reap what you sow.

Besides this thought, the golden ratio is very interesting. My friend used DMT and told me it is everywhere. Fibonacci sequence is like 1+1+1+1(adding constants to eachother to grow in size), except you’re adding itself to the last itself (1 1 2 3 5 8), which is self fulfilling growth at a much faster rate while staying the same shape. It creates the perfect ratio, and the perfectly balanced growth rate/waveform that is found everywhere because it is so stable.",26,3230,4,579,0

I began MDing to cope with medication resistant depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I’ve been taking about 50mg, roughly one day on, two days off. 
I was operating under the assumption that I would learn to identify things like ‘afterglow’ and find positive changes in my body easily, as I am super sensitive to drugs and medications. One of the reasons I chose this is because I’ve tried at least 7 different pysch meds, and completed an 8 week course of TMS treatment that barely touched my depression. To say I’m desperate for relief is an understatement. But I have not noticed much of a change in my depression, but it’s possibly I have a little less anxiety. Aside from that I’m not craving as much sugar and have become almost intolerant to alcohol, which is fine but wasn’t a problem to begin with. 
When I started at 50mg I would get a mild headache, but that went away. I bumped up to 60mg today and I feel sort of TV static-y, which makes me think that’s too high of a dose.

2023-04-24 18:03:19,Pain experiment cont & General mind relief experience.,"Continuing from Tuesday 18th, dosed at 0.100 psilocybin mushroom. Was a great day. It had been a great week to be honest. It was a full on week and haven't really stopped, on top of the general upkeep of the house, mowing lawn, clearing and cleaning up patio, several tip trips. Making most of the beautiful weather bestowed upon the south coast of England. Although exhausting at times, thoroughly enjoyable just being present and doing general day to day activities. I've sang lots, danced lots, laughed lots and my wheelie game is getting seriously strong 😁. 

Apologies got bit lost in thought there!Back to the experiment! Pain wise is non existent it seems now, just a distance memory. Even whilst doing my activities I was occasionally using my limb to balance and take some weight. Again didn't cause any flare up in symptoms or pain!

Friday 21st next dosing day,  decided to lower my dose again. Went with 0.080 and I feel I will stick with this and continue dosing with the two days off between for another fee weeks and assess. 
Pain wise again there is no noticeable 'pain' I often have the sensations of deep tissues, muscle movement in limb. Zero episodes of pain or spasmodic episodes. Very very interesting. 
Had a fairly relaxed, lazy weekend compared to my previous week's. Was definitely good for mind, body, spirit.

Mon 24th dose 0.080 psilocybin mushroom, weekend had a few personal issues with family and took its toll mentally. Reflected, refocused and  discussed. Back to previous mental clarity and inner calmness. Did resort back to punching kitchen cupboard, but released and didn't hold blame as would have before. Solid workout session in the rain to calm and lift one's spirit again. Pain is still a distant memory with regards to the limb, no phantom sensations, no knee throbbing. Knuckle is a little sore 😂

I would conclude there is potentially an aid with microdosing and pain management, but as we know it isn't a magic solution and the work needs to be done. I feel a combination of the dosing, better mind management, meditation, healthier eating, consistent exercising and generally being kinder to myself. I believe my last post a few mentioned TMS (Mind Body Syndrome)  and from I've researched it certainly does fit with my changes, acceptance rather than avoidance. 

I do however believe that it all started with the shroom, last summer when I first started to grow them. Since then it has been a wonderful teacher and helped guide me to where I am today. My mental health is so so much better than I can recall. I have been off weed now for about a month with no desire or craving to want to partake. I have self medicated with weed all my adult life on and off.

 Being able to hold and start a conversation, something I always struggled with. Being less social anxious/awkward, I no longer get the dread and crippling fear/anxiety when suggested so and so is coming to visit or have invited us over. Supermarkets don't give me the fear and dread they once did, I still occasionally get that feeling brewing, but am able to feel it  and let it pass without wanting the ground to swallow me up. I am happy to go get my wheels and go about doing the shopping, smiling at strangers and striking up conversations. I make a point of doing this several times throughout the week, getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. 

I have benefitted so much and as a result of this it has had an amazing effect on my family and in general everyone I interact with on a daily basis. I am eternally grateful to be a part of this and honoured to be able to conduct my own personal experiment/experience and to share my findings and feelings with this community",54,3693,8,648,0
2023-04-24 17:51:07,Nausea/anxiety but tolerable. Should I lower dose?,"I’ve been following a 4 days on 3 days off schedule (open to alternatives) and started with .125g and have gone as high as .25g. I find I feel outright sick at .25g (for me sick and anxious feel basically the same so not sure which it is tbh but none of the nausea reducing techniques have helped at all so I assume it’s more anxiety based). It’s tolerable at the lower range, I can still function I just feel like I’m noticing a lot of bodily sensations and feel kinda sick and energized but kinda like I’m in a dream. it’s not at all what I’d call pleasant. But I find the times I’m not taking it (off days and 5-6 hours after a dose) I a lot feel better than before I started. I’m wondering if I should lower the dose so I don’t have the unpleasant sensations or if that might decrease the amount if benefits I’m seeing the rest of the time. If it helps I started the MD because I have been struggling to have any patience or connect with/have empathy for anyone, no motivation and a really “victim” mindset (this is mostly relatively recent change, so I’m not like a sociopath or anything!). I have 3 kids so I really need to get out of this mindset. Im not sure if lowering the dose so I don’t notice it would slow any progress. 

Also curious, if I’m having so many unpleasant feelings on a small dose .25g I feel bad enough that I can’t really function. Just sick and anxious, funny vision (not hallucinating more like a dreamy/floaty feeling), etc. Would it be a really bad idea to take a larger (full experience) dose? I do have a prescribed benzodiazepine on hand. I just really am desperate to feel compassion and connection again.",50,1642,7,309,0

I am one of those unlucky people whose body is absolutely wired for stress. I can literally feel adrenaline coursing through my veins at all times. I have Lyme and a ton of food allergies and my body is very delicate and overreactive.

I went through a few extremely traumatic events in the last two years, including a severe benzo withdrawal and ending a 10 year relationship. My stress levels were off the charts. 

I feel like my ability to cope with stressors has diminished greatly since these events and I’m wondering if mushrooms could help someone like me. I find it almost impossible to relax because the stress hormones are overflowing. I worry and ruminate constantly. I’m trying to find something to calm my body and brain on a cellular level.

2023-04-23 21:25:58,Looking for reports or testiomonials about microdosing in eldery people,"So I came into psychedelics after a cancer diagnosis and it's been great.  I am a hard touch with substances, always needed a lot more, for me personally I can't do microdosing because a basic trip for me 4 + grams with rue.  Born fucked up I guess.  

Since my diagnosis I've had to live with my parents and they've been really great about letting me pursue this.  

My father is started to get a bit absent minded and some health issues, 76 next month.  He's been debating doing a macro dose sometime this year, but I thought perhaps a microdose may suit him better.  He's a light touch.  

And his mom wasn't..great, sort of a emotional void I suppose, she was not a good person and he's said that he doesn't think she ever loved him.  

I'd like to resolve that in some fashion if I could.  

I was hoping that some people here had some reports that they could share about results in older populations.",71,906,10,167,0
2023-04-23 20:00:56,Microdosing to quit cigarettes,"I started microdosing last week with lsd, I only did it for 2 days and already had great results. A great result is that I don't care about drinking anymore, I used to have the urge to drink wine very often because of negative emotions I felt, mostly grieve. I don't think that it's done by just using lsd twice so I'll still work on that. I used 50 mcg the first day and 150 mcg the second day, I know, that's not microdosing but I wanted to see what it would do.

 Now I want to use lsd to quit smoking cigarettes. Did anymore quit smoking this way, if you did how did you do it? Do you have some advice?",30,606,4,122,0

2020-11-05 19:56:33,“You shouldn’t feel anything” ?,"I see this said a lot around the sub and in other places about microdosing.- *“You shouldn’t feel anything”*.  I think that statement is not all that accurate and can be somewhat confusing to newcomers.

If you are an experienced microdoser and have read other people’s anecdotal reports or guides, maybe it would best to tell someone the negative things that they should **NOT** be feeling when taking a proper microdose.

For example- 
You should **NOT** feel:
- high
- spacey
- impaired
- confused
- unable to focus or concentrate
- jittery
- hallucinate, have visuals or distortions in your vision, dilated pupils 
- tiredness 

However, if you do feel any of those things then that might mean you have either taken too much, you may have a low tolerance, are highly sensitive to psychedelics, and/or the stuff you have is more potent, so you should probably adjust your dosage accordingly. [You need to find your sweet spot](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/plrxca/faqtip_101_what_is_the_subthreshold_dose/).
(Unless of course you like feeling some of those or seeing visuals during your normal day🙃🤩.) 

Personally I prefer to double up once in awhile or take a slightly higher dose only when I have nothing to do that day, get into a good set & setting, (positive mindset,set my intentions, be in a peaceful and relaxing environment, etc.), and maybe listen to some guided meditation, and really just let go. 

Remember, that's not always for the faint of heart though, and for those that might be new to psychedelics and have a predisposition to panic attacks, bipolar, schizophrenia, or any family history of those should use extreme caution, be under careful observation, or possibly according to Dr. Fadiman and other researchers, you may need to avoid taking psychedelics. There have been *some* reports from individuals that if they taken too high of a microdose of mushrooms or microdosed LSD, and have a predisposition to some of those things, have said that they felt an increase in anxiety levels or made them a little manic, hyper, like having too much caffeine, or even worse a temporary psychosis episode. 

If you do take too much, like I did one time (on purpose for scientific intentions), I started having a panic attack, and a thought loop started, but then I remembered reading about this trick with [black peppercorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/fe1luu/if_you_start_to_feel_anxious_some_paranoia_panic/) and it helped calm me down almost instantly! I also did some deep breathing and meditation, then had one of the best days ever! 😌🙏🏼

**Reminder:** The recommended starter dose for ""micro-doses"" could be in the range of 0.05g-0.1g (50mg-100mg) of bone-dry, ground up and mixed P. Cubensis mushrooms; or if truffles then around 0.3 grams (300mg) dried. If you use fresh truffles, you may need around 0.5g. When microdosing LSD you should only start between 5ug-10ug. (Check out volumetric dosing in the [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/wiki/index)

## Ok and now that that’s out of the way, here’s some of the positive things that most people have reported, and that they have perceived *“feelings of” or “sensations of”*:  ##

- Joy, happy, content, uplifted feeling
- More openness in social situations, or connectedness 
- Flow state
- Stillness, calm, in the present moment
- Shift in thoughts or awareness, more aware of one’s surroundings
- Heightened alertness, awareness of emotions or sensitivity to emotions; crying (which can be a good release of suppressed emotions)
- Compassion
- Gratefulness 
- Boost in creativity 
- A boost in energy, focus or productivity (or not)

Unfortunately, in some cases psychedelics could also cause individuals to be tired or sleepy too. That’s why it’s important to experiment on days off from any important obligations, and for your safety and others around you, **do not drive or operate heavy machinery.**

**Differences between microdosing Psilocybin vs LSD:** With psilocybin, some people may notice more creativity, empathy, and openness, and less focus, logic, and analytical thinking. While some people that try LSD, might notice they have more focus and logical thinking, and less empathy, compassion and openness.

Microdosing may also amplify your emotions sometimes or suppressed emotions may resurface, so be sure you set your intentions and have a good emotional support plan in place to help deal with any uncomfortable feelings. I found it best to combine microdosing with other therapeutic tools. You can read more on that [in my older post here on self-help resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/atxukg/some_selfhelp_and_resources_for_people_looking_to).

Of course those positive feelings or sensations in the 2nd list **may vary per individual and typically happen gradually over time**. In some cases it could take a month or more. (Took me about 5-6 weeks to really see the true benefits.) Others however have reported feeling better in less than 2 weeks, or even after the 1st dose an overall sense of feeling positive. Schedules can vary from 1 day on/2 days off; 4 days on/3 days off; every other day, etc. You will need to customize your regimen/schedule, find your sweet spot dose, and find what works best for you.

To summarize: Each of our brains, bodies and nervous systems are slightly different, so it can have different effects on each individual, and this is all still somewhat an experiment. There is no one size fits all. And sometimes it may not be the right thing for everyone, or the answer to all your problems. Remember you are experimenting with some pretty potent psychedelic & mind altering medicine here, so please use caution and practice harm reduction. Please experiment responsibly and don’t try it your first time at work, school, or on a day of important obligations and responsibilities.

Hopefully you’ll find your sweet spot dose soon enough and feel the positive one and not those negative effects. Although if you do still feel those negatives after trying for a while, (maybe a month or two), then you may need to accept that microdosing psychedelics may not be the right choice for you, or you just need to combine it with other therapeutic tools, or go all out and do a macro therapeutic trip under guided supervision, and under a good set and setting. 

So what do you think? Maybe other experienced microdosers can share and expand on this?

**Disclaimer:** If you have a history of any major psychotic disorders or heart condition, please do not self-medicate with psychedelics without first doing your research, consulting with a doctor, or a therapist, etc.. Especially if you’re taking other medications. Also please check out our [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/wiki/index) for more information and learn as much as you can before jumping into microdosing.

2020-10-17 08:41:20,"Yep! It's true, every single word they said about microdosing is true.","I'm a 34 years old guy with 2 kids, i have always been kind of pushover. I can't say NO.

I always wanted to start my dream business but couldn't because i never had enough courage to take risks.

And now after 3 months of microdosing lsd, the product i want sell is being manufactured right now.

I have established some boundaries with my wife, family and friends.

I can't really tell how everything happened, after i started microdosing it felt really natural to start saying NO and start thinking about myself, and guess what, when you start saying NO to people, they start respecting you and appreciate much more when you do even smallest things for them. People are weird!

I am just now finding out how not depressed people feel for the first time in 42 years.,"I will add my microdose info at the bottom from another thread but today I realized I’m not a low energy, weak, introvert. I have had an unhealthy brain.

After 42 years I can only imagine how life would have gone had this treatment been available in my 20s when I first got counseling for my childhood trauma. CPTSD 

It’s like I am suddenly no longer dragging around the anchor that has been weighing me down. I am going out more, exploring my interests, I have the freedom from existential dread to actually engage in life, try everything I have been to overwhelmed to try for years.

It’s awesome!

*****highly recommended Stamets protocol but this is what I end up doing which is pretty close.
I may add the niacin he also recommends for the stacked dose*******

I am dosing both 0.1 g dry weight psilocybin mushroom and 500mg of lions mane( extract). 
5 days on, 2 days off(update - now a month later 4 days on, 3days off)

Stamets recommends 5-20g dry weight of lions mane mushroom which I didn’t have so I purchased a highly recommended brand . It is working!


I have had diagnosed anxiety and depression since I was ... well nearly 3 decades now. No meds worked, though many were tried, so I got off them a few years ago and just pushed through.

I’m only 2 weeks in but it’s been life changing. On dose days I no longer experience that extreme depression lethargy, and the anxiety overwhelm and intrusive thoughts are not an issue.

It’s like my inner pain is taken down from an 8 to a 1.5 which is a ton easier to cope with and it allows me to make new thought and behaviour patterns.

On non dose days I am less naturally calm and energetic but because of changed behaviour on dose days I have new options of thought and behaviour to fall back on and can through will decide to push for the new healthier patterns.

I have in the last 2 weeks done things that I have been putting off for a year or more because I have until now simply been so overwhelmed and sure I would fail that I couldn’t even try. Paralyzed.

Oddly when you aren’t scared and sad and stressed you can be successful at things.

Personally I started this not just for the emotional help but also because I have had two major concussions in the last 5 years and all combined I was really having trouble. 

The last concussion made my vision strained despite testing at 20/20. Having used psilocybin and knowing how it enhances vision I had my fingers crossed it could help. It certainly has. Thank goodness because I have been having significant headaches I assume from eye strain and they also go away on dose days. 

My hope was to heal and rewire my brain.
It is working even better than I could have hoped.

I will say I am a seasoned meditator and started this knowing I would have to use these tools consciously for them to help as I need them to.

I have started a journal and at every opportunity where an old standard response could happen I make a concerted effort to see if I can do things different than I have been. End of this week it’s just happening on its own. :)

Oh and the first concussion severely impacted my language center. It never fully recovered and my vocabulary was minimized to a large degree.

In just the last 2 weeks I have been spontaneously using words that were basically lost to me. :) and remembering lost passwords. :)

I would 100 percent recommend it.


If anyone is considering trying it please do yourself a favour and give yourself this chance.

thank you to everyone who has promoted this over the years. Of course Paul Stamets and Micheal Pollan come to mind but we know many others have been working in silence and I thank you all so much for your trail blazing.

You have given me a new life.

I have an old man who works there help me with the rope, I felt guilty because he was selling me my death tools

I walked down the isle to check out, I saw a grown man pushing his cart with two little boys wearing transformers Halloween masks for face masks. I waved and smiled, the little boy waved and smiled back. I think that’s the moment that stuck with me

2019-07-05 13:57:04,Be honest with yourself about why you are microdosing,"I've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while.  A lot of people come here and want to try either mushrooms or lsd for their depression or anxiety.  That is great and I believe mushrooms and lsd can be a profound tool for those ailments.  However, so many people here get mixed up with ""not being able to feel it"".  They are looking for an instant result.  This leads to taking more of these drugs till they ""feel it"".  I think the problem that comes with that is the same issue of using say opiates for depression and anxiety.  You are not working or treating your depression or anxiety.  You are looking for a short term high that will distract you from your problems.  This will create a negative thought cycle and craving for this or that drug when your symptoms hit you.

Now I have zero issue for using mushrooms or lsd for enhancing yourself for specific days or wanting a light buzz.  Yet you need to be fully honest with yourself because you are not being monitored by a doctor for taking this stuff and you have to exercise self control.  You cannot have a hope of getting better if your not consistent with understanding why you are doing something.  Depression is not a joke of a disease and playing with these drugs is not something that should be taken lightly.  Not fully understanding and having a goal and mission going into this can be dangerous without having a medical professional their to make sure you are on a steady improving path.

&#x200B;

All I am saying is understand why you are getting into this.  Realize that sub-perceptual dose may mean not ""feeling it"".  These drugs may take a while to work in low dosages like many other medicines out there.  The future of these drugs and what the perception will be in the future is somewhat riding on us as experimenters to take this scientifically and smart. Try not to get sucked into a cycle of chasing a high to treat depression.  I've caught myself many times wanting that feeling and i do fail sometimes as well.",53,1994,9,361,0

2021-03-06 19:23:03,This sub has many issues that need to be discussed.,"I've felt the need to make a post like this for a few months now but a post I read last night really made my blood boil. 

Last night I was scrolling through my feed as usual and I saw a post from this subreddit that read ""Microdosing my father with Alzheimer's."" Obviously a very tough situation that many go through and something I can relate to in a way. This is where It starts to turn though. The OP acknowledges that there could be a risk/danger dosing his father but he then follows it up with a ""but what do I have to lose?"" 
So I think this goes without saying but I'll say it anyways **DONT DOSE PEOPLE WITHOUT THERE CONSENT**. The OP didn't specify in his post BUT as someone that works with the mentally ill, including people with dimentia and Alzheimer's, I can confidently say that many people with these diseases don't have the ability to consent reasonably. 
Of course I dont know OP'S father, how far progressed he is, or his state of mind but the way his post was worded it sounded like his father was definitly not in a *sound* state of mind. 

This also leads into a bigger problem this sub has that I've noticed. Theres this sentiment that microdosing is a cure-all for everything. A little hyperbole on my part but there still exists this idea that with all mental problems that micro-dosing can help. Feeling depressed? Micro-dose. Feeling angry? Micro-dose. Feeling anything besides happy and good? Micro-dose. Sometimes I get this feeling that some people here are using micro-dosing as a vice to avoid confronting whatever issues they have going on. One time I saw someone compare micro-dosing to insulin replying to a comment saying that not everyone micro-dosing needs to be micro-dosing. Im just going to throw this out there you're not going to die if you stop micro-dosing, you're not at risk of losing your eye-sight, a foot, a leg due to not micro-dosing, all of which is true for people with diabetes and insulin. 

Im going to say this once because I've seen it for myself and there seems to be heavy opposition to this point in many psychedelic communities, **Psychedelics can be abused and misused like any other drug.** 

Also, I don't see this said enough around here so I'll say it now, 

**IF YOU HAVE, OR BELIEVE TO HAVE, MENTAL ILLNESS SUCH AS DEPRESSION, PTSD, BIPOLAR, SCHIZOPHRENIA, ETC. SEEK PROFFESIONAL HELP** 

Theres no shame in going to therapy and being on medication. There's this line of thinking in a lot of psychedelic communities Im in(not just this one) that prescription pills are bad and that mushrooms and psychedelics are good because they're derived from nature. Ive said this in a comment on a different sub before but I wanted to share it here too. Prescription drugs are tools, much like psychedelics, of course they dont work for everyone but just because they didn't work for you doesn't mean that you should discourage anyone from trying them to see if it works for them. 

Back to the original post I referred to,
I scroll into the comments where a lot of people were saying ""Im not a doctor but go for it."" Well you got one thing right, youre not a doctor. As everyone here knows theres not a lot of research in psychedelics as of yet and a lot of people here refer to there anecdotal experience when answering to advice posts, which is fine. But for the love of god **dont pretend that your anectodal experience is applicable to everyone and every situation.** Everyone's story and situation are different and just because it helped you, for example, get out of a depression(and if you are one of these people good on you! More power to you man!) doesnt/shouldn't equate to being able to help someone with Alzheimer's or other serious diseases and illnesses.

Although this post seemed pretty negative I believe in order to have positive and proper functioning communites there needs to be discussion like this. I love the psychedelic community but there are faults just like any group. Psychedelics have changed me for the better but I have also witnessed the opposite. I feel that sometimes that this communities bias for psychedelics can sometimes cloud judgments leading to important aspects being over looked. 

Also I don't mean to tear down micro-dosing or people that have benefitted from micro-dosing I apologize if it came off that way.

EDIT: Many have pointed out that I have come across as abrasive, unempathetic, and judgemental to the individual that is dealing with an extremely challenging and heart-breaking situation. These were not my intentions at all and my heart goes out to this person and there father. I know how hard it is losing a parent and I understand the need to try and help them anyway you can. If the OP is reading this I sincerely apologize if I came off as an asshole and I'm sorry that you have to go through what you're going through man.",51,4850,10,852,0
2021-03-13 00:01:28,Sharing husband’s first shrooms trip. His depression and anxiety is almost gone after one trip.,"My husband (38M) has been suffering with depression and anxiety most of his adulthood. It got noticeably bad the last 6-12 months. Traditional therapy and anti-depressant medicine never worked for him. So we needed to try something different. A new medicine called magic mushrooms.

For his first time we wanted to start with a low dose of 2grams. He def got high but he didn’t “trip.” After 2 hours, he smoked weed (which is his normal routine at night). We didn’t expect it but that combo totally pushed him to the peak and he started tripping HARD.

He tripped for 90 minutes going in and out of the trip, vocalizing everything he is feeling, understanding, and seeing. 

Some things he said while tripping:
- he feels deep peace he’s never felt before
- the universe just wants to be whole
- all the negative thoughts and feelings don’t matter
- he feels so much love for me and the kids
- “how will I go back to real life after this?”
- “I’m unlocking chests in my mind”
- “I’m getting in touch with my soul.. I’m understanding my soul.”
- “this is beautiful. All I can say is that I’m really really ok.”

As the trip sitter, it was scary to watch him trip at first. I could tell A LOT was happening with his brain and he was tripping balls. He kept assuring us (me and his friend) that he’s ok and everything he is feeling is positive.

There were moments he cried out of deep peace and love. I also teared up just being there with him.

The next day he woke up feeling light. He says he usually wakes up feeling heavy and unable to breathe deeply, with negative thoughts. But that morning it was different. He felt “normal” and able to breathe.

6 days later (today), he texted me from work saying “I feel amazing. I can’t believe I’ve been missing out on feeling like this.”

I never knew how bad his depression and anxiety was until now. We were in it and just dealing with it that we didn’t even have time to process how bad it was.

I’m so glad we found this medicine. I hope it helps others who are suffering with depression and anxiety.

As for next uses, we’ll try a higher dose of shrooms without cannabis. And then I’ll figure out a MD regimen that works for him.

Edit: I meant 2 grams NOT 2 oz lol

2019-08-14 02:28:39,How to recognize when you're taking too many psychedelics,"# Tracking long-term effects of psychedelic drugs

When used effectively, hallucinogens can bring on altered states of consciousness that constitute immense therapeutic value. To reduce risk and ensure healing psychedelic sessions, users should exercise moderation, track their usage patterns, and monitor long-term effects. For this purpose, it is recommended that any psychedelic user keep a log of their psychedelic sessions, dosages, and experiences. This can be elaborated with journal entries, diagrams, and illustrations.

When self-medicating with psychedelics on a regular basis, it is not uncommon for the patient to find themselves managing significant emotional and psychological changes. This is sometimes accompanied by a double bind in which the psychedelic experience feels healing, but is overshadowed by an intensification of symptoms or life changes over an extended period. In these cases it is important for the user to stop, step back, and take notes of any impact psychedelics are having on various aspects of life:

* **Emotional well-being:** Prioritize your journey towards joyful contentment. Remaining open to new experience, patience, a sense of belonging, kindness toward others, and loving acceptance of oneself.
* **Social relationships:** Be vigilant of any changes to relationships with family and longstanding friends. Associate with people who have your best interest in mind, and be wary of strangers that encourage irresponsible behavior. Befriend people who make you feel safe and offer to provide mutual support.
* **Responsibilities:** Keep track of changes to your attendance or performance at work and school. Be sure you are able to support yourself and those dependent on you. Aim to earn a life that is creatively, emotionally, and socially fulfilling.
* **Neurological health:** Strive to feel safe, secure, and comfortable. Note if you begin to experience scrambled thoughts, obsessive dwelling, increased dissociation, heightened startle response, hallucinations, or other persistent alterations to cognition. These may be signs that you could benefit from psychedelic integration therapy and complementary therapeutic practices, and are often signs to slow down drug intake.
* **Physical health:** Note changes to appetite, energy levels, and general well-being. Note muscle spasms, tightness, gastrointestinal upset, and other symptoms which can be invoked by regular drug use. Maintain a nutritious diet, do routine exercise or physical therapy, monitor changes to health, and care for one’s body as a vehicle for well-being.

These considerations are adapted from systems such as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and principles from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.^[1]

# Adverse effects of psychedelic use

There are some common types of unanticipated behavior and symptoms that may arise from psychedelic use. These are described below. When dealing with any of the following complications, it is important to seek additional support to ensure one’s well-being.

In clinical psychedelic therapies, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) are widely used for providing a therapeutic foundation adjacent to psychedelic therapy.^[2] Complementary therapy practices and art therapy may be useful for managing flashbacks and other intrusive or overwhelming side-effects.^[3][4][5] Experienced psychedelic therapist or organizations can offer additional support.

## Hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD)

HPPD is among the most common side effects of psychedelic use. After taking high doses of psychedelics, the user may acutely re-experience psychedelic phenomena throughout daily life. This consists of persistent changes to sensory experiences, often visual. In research, two types of HPPD are sometimes distinguished: short-term and effects that are benign and reversible (type I), and intense long-term persistent effects that cause distress (type II).^[6]

Effects of HPPD include visual snow or static, halos or auras surrounding objects, trails or afterimages left by moving objects, increased visibility of floaters, difficulty reading text due to visual disturbances, confusing colors with one another, intensified colors, inability to discern the size of objects, increased hallucinatory phenomena when entering or leaving sleep, geometric hallucinations (with both closed and open eyes), flashes of color, illusions of movement (especially in peripheral vision), increased pattern recognition, pareidolia, and intensified sensory experiences.^[7][8][9] Cannabis use may intensify or trigger HPPD.^[10] Environments, memories, or sensory stimuli that are reminiscent of a past psychedelic trip can sometimes trigger a flashback.^[11]

Flashbacks may feel pleasant, benign, or intrusive. HPPD type I often subsides over time provided sobriety, emotional stability, and self-care. HPPD type II can be managed using psychiatric medication including antipsychotic and antiepileptics, and also may lessen over time.^[12]

## Re-exposure to traumatic memories

Psychedelic possess the ability to increase connectivity between brain regions, exposing their user to unusual thought patterns and ideas. This increased connectivity can also invoke suppressed or traumatic memories. During therapy sessions, the guide or therapist may encourage the participant to trust in their inner resources when re-experiencing traumatic associations. Integration therapy may help ensure that the participant is able to successfully translate intense psychedelic sessions into constructive and worthwhile experiences. Participants who manage traumatic memories through art therapy may prefer to keep their artwork private, depending on their comfort level.^[13]

## Escapism

Hallucinatory landscapes and omnipotent intelligence are among many fantastic things that may be elicited in altered states. Because of the novelty of these states, some users may become dependent on psychedelics to chase cognitive, aesthetic, and spiritual highs. Users often seek escapism due to difficult life circumstances or mental illness, which can also indicate increased psychological risks with regular psychedelic use.

## Delirious or obsessive thinking

Although they can elicit incredible thought connectivity and epiphany, psychedelics also may elicit delirious or obsessive thought patterns in some individuals. This can occur due to a vulnerable mindset that was overlooked during participant screening, or as a result of adverse events during the psychedelic experience itself. Integration therapy and complementary therapy practices are helpful for organizing confusing memories and ideas within a stable conceptual framework. Some users with obsessive thought patterns also exhibit a compulsion to write, draw, perform, or otherwise express themselves; creative expression may be especially relevant for these patients’ integration process.^[14]

## Dissociative symptoms

For some individuals psychedelics can invoke dissociation, depersonalization, or derealization. These conditions are frequently regarded as traumagenic or neurodevelopmental in origin, and like disorganized thinking, may be brought on or intensified by psychedelic drugs.^[14] When dealing with this set of symptoms, complementary therapy practices that are strongly focused on reducing dissociation are recommended.

2020-03-26 15:57:21,The Ultimate 2020 Guide for Microdosing,"Before I start, a big shoutout to r/microdosing - a great resource and the largest microdosing community on the internet.

With the *psychedelic renaissance* and the rising popularity of microdosing, I wanted to make a post introducing microdosing to newcomers. I tried to keep it informative and include as many resources as possible - let me know if I missed anything.

**So what is Microdosing?**

Microdosing is taking a sub-perceptual dose of a drug, typically 1/10th - 1/20th of a “normal dose”. The size can depend on the drug used, sex of user, weight, personal tolerance, and other factors.
The most commonly used drugs are classic psychedelics, due to their safety and efficacy for a range of ailments. This post will be focused on microdosing psychedelics.
*Never microdose stimulants such as MDMA, ADHD medication, or amphetamines. (Major cardiovascular issues can arise, and the benefits are often negligible.)*

**How can Microdosing help me?**

Those who microdose report a myriad benefits, but these benefits are not scientifically proven - yet. I’ve included a number of reddit discussions on the topic, as reddit is the most active discussion site for microdosing. It is near impossible to avoid anecdotal reports due to the legality of psychedelics and lack of studies. Here are some of the reported benefits:

If you have a heart condition I would recommend doing more research before partaking in microdosing.

**Source, test, and measure your drugs.**

Sourcing drugs on reddit is not allowed. However I can offer some generic advice - ask a college student, look into the dark web, or learn to grow your own mushrooms.

**Not testing your drugs is irresponsible at best, and deadly at worst.**

Psilocybin Testing - r/shrooms , [Ehrlich Test](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/9a8wie/ehrlich_reagent_can_verify_if_your_mushrooms_are/)

LSD Testing - [Elevation Chemicals](https://elevationchemicals.com/), r/LSD

You want an exact measure of psychedelics. With mushrooms, this is typically done with a milligram scale, while LSD is best dosed volumetrically ([online volumetric calculator.](http://volume.tripsit.me/)) If you are going to microdose, MEASURE YOUR DRUGS. Taking a small amount of mushrooms or a ¼ tab of acid is not microdosing - it is a low recreational dose.

**Choose a protocol.**

[r/microdosing Dosage Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/wiki/dosage-regime)

The two most popular protocols are
[Paul Stamets Psilocybin](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/9idj03/stamets_stack_psilocybinlions_maneniacin/) - .05 grams mushrooms + nootropics, 4 days on, 3 days off

[James Fadiman LSD](https://sites.google.com/view/microdosingpsychedelics/home) - 10 micrograms every three days

[Paul Staments vs. James Fadiman Protocol](https://old.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/bj5j11/paul_stamets_vs_james_fadiman_protocol/)

These are the best two protocols to start with, but you should develop your own schedule over time, catering to your own needs. I recommend to start small with your doses, slow with your dosing regimen, and work your way up as needed.

**Day 1**

Don’t drive when impaired. For your first day, choose a day where you don’t have any big responsibilities to take care of. You don’t want to make a bad example of psychedelic users or be in an uncomfortable situation at work.

**Choose a dose.**

Most start with 1/20th - 1/10th of an active dose. For LSD this is 5-10 mcgs, while psilocybin mushrooms are typically dosed from .05 grams to 0.1 grams. Other psychedelics such as mescaline, DMT, or research chemicals can be used, but these are much less common than psilocybin and LSD. To start, it is best to use whatever psychedelic you have access to or are most comfortable with. [Dose Prep - Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/wiki/preparation-dosing?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=microdosing&utm_content=t5_2yt3g)

**Track your progress.**

To really appreciate the effects, it is best if you keep track of what happens while you are microdosing. Make sure to pay attention to each day - not just dose days. Most people keep track with a journal, but r/microdosing user u/tourmod [made an app to track microdosing.](https://old.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/bm0zb2/i_created_the_md_tracking_app_i_always_wanted_and/) If you truly want to improve your life with microdosing, pay attention and take notes.

2021-02-11 21:55:39,Microdosing cured my premature ejaculations,"I am a male in my late 40s. Thanks to many traumatic experiences in my childhood and teen years, I always had a huge anxiety associated with sex. That not only caused problems gaining and maintaining erections but also a severe premature ejaculation problem. I used to come fast, really really fast, sometimes even before penetrations. In 2010 I started SSRIs. It resolved my PE and now I could last a bit longer, though I still had problem getting and maintaining erections. 

Over the years I decided to come off SSRIs a few times. But each time my premature ejaculations returned and I ended up going back on SSRIs just because of it. About a year and a half ago I used a different strategy. I gradually tapered off my SSRIs, like previous times, but this time I microdosed shrooms and/or LSD once every 2 to 3 days (often alternating between the two). To my huge surprise, nether did I experience impotence nor premature ejaculations. In fact my sex life has rocketed. I never experienced such strong libido, perfect erections and full control over my ejaculations. I am in my late 40s but I feel like a horny teenager :-) 

In addition to MD'ing, one or more of the following might also have helped 

1. I went on a Keto diet about 6 months before quitting SSRIs and I still remain on it to this day. Low carb high fat diet is considered a better fuel for the brain.
2. I started meditation twice a day, 30 minute each session. I remain very regular with this routine. Becoming mindful of your sensations definitely improves sex life.
3. I took a few large doses of magic mushrooms (2 - 5 grams)
4. Started running regularly for the first time in my life

I think psychedelics (along with meditation) played a primary role in healing the past trauma and low self esteem by rewiring my brain. Perhaps that is why I was also able to switch to, and maintain, a healthy lifestyle for the first time in my life. It has been 18 months and I feel great.",43,1951,5,356,0

Lately I've been dealing with some almost unbearable circumstances. So much happening at once. I felt overwhelmed, scared, and honestly just to tired to tackle it all. But, while cleaning I opened up a cannister to find a stash of mushrooms. I had completely forgotten about them! 

It's kind of crazy because at 2 of the absolute lowest times in my life, Mushrooms have just ""magically"" appeared!! 😊 I've heard the saying ""when the student is ready, the teacher appears"" and definitely believe it. 

So.. I took 1 gram and slowly I wanted to do the things I had put off. And did them. I laid out a plan to overcome all my circumstances that I just couldn't see before. There is a light at the end of this dark, dark tunnel. And as a bonus, I the cleaned my whole house!

2022-12-29 20:00:27,Four Weeks into Psilocybin: I wouldn't believe it if it wasn't happening to me. A Detailed Account.,"I wanted to share my experience with as many ""primary documents"" as possible. By that I mean real-time texts sent to my microdosing partner who started this journey 6 months ago. Some background on me:

* 43 years old, Male
* BPD diagnosed about 8 years ago
* Two major and one minor manic episode in the last 7 years
* Talk therapy (weekly and biweekly) for 6 years
* Multiple pharmaceutical anti-depressants and mood-stabilizers that either made me a zombie or left me with chronic tinnitus over the past 5 years
* Have an academic background in Neuroscience (it was my major)

I had a number of life-changing things happen all at once and talk therapy and pharmaceuticals were not doing it. I had my first child the December before COVID, moved from my home of the last 15 years, got laid off during tech layoff frenzy, and of course, endured the double isolation of having a new child and being COVID quarantined. It's been a difficult few years (as it has been for everyone).

Four weeks ago, I started microdosing after I noticed how much it had helped my sister. She was on the emotional hamster wheel, and after a few months, I couldn't keep questioning whether this was real or not. Like all of us who struggle with depression, we often have false summits and it's hard to tell if something really has changed. But she insisted something really had, and she was (is) right. I said ""it feels like this thing has Roomba'd your brain and I want that too.""

**One week in:**

I had been taking psilocybin every morning, but I didn't feel any change for the first week. I remember it feeling actually pretty sad because I had so much hope. But I was still feeling the same. But then...

&#x200B;

**Ten Days In AKA Day 1:**

https://preview.redd.it/wpoo63n0sv8a1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f539915bbe2bc9a7663db4cded37e93023f1f891

This morning was absolutely unexpected, and hard to explain. Here are a few texts that begin to capture the feeling in real-time, and I'll speak more to it below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7byksj6ssv8a1.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=702373ae1a9e4d2d186f4882bd672891d40daf64

This has so far been the closest thing to summarizing what my anecdotal experience felt like. I was waking up EVERY morning fighting anger, sadness, irritability, and all the attendant issues around systemic depression. But I woke up that morning, with what felt like my ""Hangups Cortex"" and my ""Resentments Cortex"" full on lobotomized. It just wasn't there anymore.

Correction. It was there, but I was looking at it like it was a car wreck that I was driving by. Before, it felt like there was this gigantic juggernaut of emotions, hangups, angers, traumas, etc that every single reaction I had would have to go through before I had a reaction. If someone said something, or something happened in the news, I had a well-worn pathway through a labyrinth of bullshit that I would feel before I reacted. This morning, that was...just gone.

Combining the research with my own experience, my guess is the following. The psilocybin is priming massive quantities of synapses (and the neuronal networks they comprise) and all of a sudden, there are all these roads with their streetlights turned on and I can go anywhere I want. Before, I had one road, and I hated it, but I went down it for reasons of convenience and ego. It's not like these other roads weren't always there, they were, but the lights had slowly died out, and I didn't take these roads anymore.

But now, I had all these other ways, many of which felt like I had turned back the clock 10-15 years on trauma. I was feeling, in some ways, like I felt when I was at my best in the past. My physiological theory is simply that all of these networks were there from my past (since the brain rarely truly forgets), the psilocybin primed the synapses to all these other networks were *as* available to me as the depressed one. I could still chose to react like I did in the past, but for god sake why? I hated that way.

**Day 3: Talk Therapy vs Microdosing**

https://preview.redd.it/yhvy3muwzv8a1.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=949a79b1dbfed3d207405aecfe088d22022920bd

This distinction with talk therapy I think is important. I've done therapy for so many years, and it was genuinely helpful, and I loved my therapist. However, there's a very important difference between the two when it comes to actually changing patterns. With talk therapy, you're essentially trying to use your conscious brain to force biochemical patterns to change. And I worry that in the revisiting over and over and over, we're actually inadvertently reinforcing those networks rather than utilizing new ones.

Therapy is using **behavior** to affect **biochemistry** and **brain physiology**. However, using psilocybin is the opposite, using actual biochemistry to affect behavior. Pharmaceuticals act the same way, but they are designed differently. SSRIs, for example, just keep your pre-synaptic neuron from vacuuming the seratonin back up so it just sits in your cleft and keeps firing your post-synaptic neuron. But microdosing does not actually force anything to happen, it's just priming it so it's ready and available.

I think of it like when I got an epidural in my back because of a spinal issue. The epidural didn't fix my back, but it relieved the pain long enough so I could then exercise and strengthen my back again. I still had to do all the work, the shot just gave me a chance. Same as the microdosing, it doesn't do the work for me, but it gives me a chance.

**Day 5: It's starting to settle**

I felt safe. I'm tearing up just typing this. I feel safe. I haven't felt that in I don't know how long. I just can't even.

**Post Week 1 closing thoughts:**

If you've followed along this far, congratulations. You're clearly interested!

This is essentially my sentiment now. I'm in Week 4/5 of this journey, and there is SO MUCH left to go. My questions now revolve around the resilience of this change. For my sister who's been at this for over half a year, it seems to have settled in well, and there hasn't been any systemic slip back into old patterns.

One thing that is clear about this. Unlike the anti-depressants and mood-stabilizers I've taken, this absolutely allows me to be fully emotionally present. When I was on a couple of anti-depressants, I felt like I couldn't cry if I tried. I was just inert. But I live the way [Jimmy V said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TuiPeN6DBE) when he gave that Espys speech. I want to laugh, cry, and think everyday. And psilocybin allows this, and in fact, allows it in ways that I didn't realize I could do again.

I'm happy to answer questions as they come up below. I could honestly talk about this forever. I feel like a missionary who just discovered God and I need to share it. I see so much depression and anxiety all around me, and for real for real, help is around.

Happy journey to you all.",99,7794,17,1181,0
2021-01-02 18:49:34,This is what one month microdosing has done to my life,"I have been microdosing with mushrooms for one month, one day on two days off. This is what I have observed so far:

• I have attended many long meditation retreats with 6-8 daily hours of meditation, and I can only compare the wellness I feel from MD with the wellness I feel during those retreats. 

• I have felt more equanimity and have been less reactive.

• I don't feel tired during the day, and I have long days (4am-10pm).

• I don't drink much alcohol (one beer or cup of wine maybe once or twice a week). Now I don't feel like drinking any. I have observed that even one single beer can affect my feeling of wellness at a subtle level.

• I have anxiety episodes quite often and during MD I have been able to neutralize them very quickly, before they turn into conflict with someone. And now I don't feel the physical discomfort caused by those episodes.

• I used to take cannabis very often, specially to handle my anxiety. Now I feel I don't need it.

• I have felt more creative.

• I have felt more sociable.

• I have recovered my capacity to keep eye contact when interacting with people. I used to avoid eye contact.

• I was able to resume my 2 hours meditation daily routine which I had lost for a long time (this is a topic for another post).

Everyone can react differently. I spoke to my psychotherapist AND my general practitioner about starting microdosing before I tried it. Both basically told me the same thing: avoid it if I had a family history of psychosis or schizophrenia, do not mix medications (especially SSRIs, amphetamines, and alcohol), do not drive unless it's safe, and to have their numbers on standby.** Don't lie to your doctors, they are there to help.

# Here's my story. I hope it's worth the long read, but there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

In the last 8 months, I became depressed and anxious to the point of contemplating suicide multiple times (diagnosed single-episode major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder). Therapy helped keep the really really bad/suicidal thoughts at bay, but I was suffering as I had never suffered in my life before. Panic attacks where I would shut down and be stuck in thought loops occurred daily. A month ago, I had a friend who underwent doctor-monitored nasal Ketamine therapy for addiction and treatment-resistant depression, and it changed his life. He was a new person, in just two weeks. It brought tears to my eyes hearing his story, and from his family (who, never in a million years, would have never guessed they would approve a psychedelic for medical treatment).

I have a degree in biochemistry. I don't believe in spirituality at all, whatsoever. I was never opposed to shrooms, but I had a strong distaste for the 'hippy' type of people who didn't even understand the science behind the drugs they were ingesting (no offense /r/shrooms!). It kept me away from ever taking interest in psychedelics other than for recreational use.

I am part of many scientific pages and communities and read top PubMed/other journals weekly. I have seen HUNDREDS of studies and discussions about psychedelics for mental treatment over the last few years. Headlines began popping up in the general news about LSD, MDMA, Ecstasy and Psilocybin treatments all over my internet over the last few years too.

I was at rock bottom, and my friend's experience gave me the first glimpse of hope that even therapy couldn't provide. I started looking into psychedelics as treatment. Not in the spiritual sense, because that wouldn't help someone like me. I wanted a medicine (although somewhat understudied) that had **low risk** but **high anecdotal** AND **researched/experimental success.** Due to psychedelics' illegal nature, I felt somewhat stuck (because I had no plugs/friends who could provide). Looking at the measured health risks of psilocybin/shrooms being so low, I decided that I would research more into shrooms, their risks, and their medical/mental benefits over any other psychedelic.

**It was like discovering gold.** So many anecdotal stories all over the internet. Being super data/fact-based, I am always wary of fake news, especially anecdotal stories. But I thought to myself, ""why would these people have any reason to lie?"". From microdoses to heroic doses, people everywhere were often experiencing life-altering positive changes with psilocybin. The FDA listed psilocybin a breakthrough therapy a week ago. **Holy SHIT.** My understanding of shrooms --and psychedelics in general-- began to change.

I began reading much of the existing literature of HOW psilocybin affects our serotonin receptors and works in the brain after crossing the blood-brain barrier. Once I began understanding how psilocybin could heal and create neural connections that ""bypass"" or ""reset"" the *negative-thought-cycles, vices, and addictions* our brains create in times of stress/bad habits, I realized this could be a good thing for me. I didn't feel ready for a full trip, but read so many positive microdosing experiences online that I couldn't believe it. The topic of microdosing felt scientific, measured, and calculated. I hated the 'illicit/illegal' feeling I still get from discussing 'shrooms, but microdosing felt much closer to medicine for me. Some people experienced an uplift in focus and mood, while others felt like it saved their life. After reading about the few known issues, I thought I'd take the (low) risk. **What did I have to lose?**

I began growing my own shrooms early in November after doing some research and being frustrated with *not* finding a dealer. I thought, ""fuck it, I'll grow my own medicine then!"". While my rice bags were colonizing (18/20 successful so far, no contams!), I found a dealer and bought a very small amount of shrooms, about 3 grams. I got a pill capsule filler from Amazon and filled 25 pills with 0.08g psilocybin (I didn't have enough powder to compact them more. I wanted 0.1g capsules). This amount would do, regardless.

I started my first microdoses with 2 capsules, 0.16g every 2-3 days about 2 weeks ago. I became nervous I was ripped off, but Reddit assured me they were *P. cubensis.* I posted pictures after the capsule process just to check.

The first microdose, I didn't feel anything. I was super bummed! Why wasn't my brain rewiring itself? Why was my anxiety still so bad? The next day, I did feel a little bit better, but nothing worth noting. I waited and I took my next 0.16g dose two days later.

This second microdose came at a great time. I was on a slight mental upswing already. I realized what everyone said was true: **you will never directly feel the effects of a microdose. That's the point of a microdose**. It didn't give me energy like caffeine, or relaxation like Xanax, or focus like Adderall. **I couldn't tell I had taken a microdose**, per se. But wow. For the first time, the horrible, negative/anxious thoughts I was plagued by **were no longer the first thoughts that came up**. These thoughts were still there, don't get me wrong. But I could tell that I felt slightly more at peace and accepting of myself and my situation that I had before. I decided I would take 0.16g every two days for a while.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have taken 6 microdoses now, with my 6th being this morning. **Holy shit.** Do you know how I knew they were working? I realized I hadn't even thought about suicide for almost 5 days. Not even a slight thought. I still have anxiety, but it doesn't debilitate me like it was before.

Another good metric I was using was my mental self-image. The last few months, I felt sad and disappointed looking at myself in the mirror. I wasn't attractive anymore. Yet the last few days, I can't help but smile when I look in the mirror. I look like a stud! And I'm smiling. I started tearing up looking at the mountains I live by, realizing for the first time in MONTHS that my life really IS worth living.

The last two days, I had the regular stressors in my life I've always had -- work, social stresses, thinking about the future. But for the first time, whether on a microdose or on my off-days, **I don't shut down like I did the last few months.** I've had the energy and drive to hit the gym and I worked out more in the last week than I have in the last two months. Alone in my apartment's gym, I was smiling like a goon. I felt incredible! Working out was the most cathartic thing I had experienced in weeks! I cried tears of joy. I felt great. I felt like myself.

I catch myself smiling at little things throughout the day as I used to as a child/teenager. I FEEL like a teenager again, in the best way possible.

Being science-based, I'm aware of the necessity for skepticism and any possible placebo effects. Even if some of this is placebo, there's *no fucking way* it's all placebo. Psilocybin, in micro-undetectable-doses, has already helped me more in two weeks than anything I've tried yet.

For the first time in months, I feel like myself again.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I would like to help as many people as this ground-up powder has helped me.

# TL;DR: Was hesitant about shrooms. Had a friend who changed their life with psychedelics. Researched shrooms. Started microdosing. Two weeks later, I feel incredible. My anxiety and depression are fading. I'm not 100% better yet, but I feel like myself again.",109,8306,15,1384,0

YOU need to make your own choices and microdosing can give you the clarity to make these choices, and the satisfaction of achieving your goals. even if its just the little things. now go do the dishes.",67,553,11,107,0
2020-06-18 12:28:32,Two weeks of micro dosing mushrooms - very impressed.,"I'm a medical professional in my 50's.  I've been struggling with anxiety since a teenager.  In the last 3 years my anxiety has been progressively worsening.  My anxiety is largely focused around my intense, demanding job.  I presently work 16 hour days 6 days a week just to barely stay on top of things.

I've been seeing a therapist for a few years with out much improvement.  I take supplements including CBD, Ashwaganda and theonine which have been questionably effective (suspect placebo effect).  My doctor prescribed cannibis to help me sleep and tha works very well.  I have been meditating for the last 30 years.   I have chosen not to take any prescription medications for work because my job requires that my mind be very sharp at all times.

I've been reading about microdosing for a few months and finally got some Golden Teacher mushrooms.   I've ordered a scale but it hasn't arrived yet due to pandemic related postal delays.
I've been taking about 1/16 of a TSP of ground mushrooms every 2-3 days.  I don't feel any intoxicating effects at that dose.  One day I took 3 times that amount and I felt a little different - definitely too high a dose for microdosing.

Response so far:
BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS!!
- My work is extremely demanding.  I have a packed appointment schedule and sick patients booked on top of that, along with following up on other sick patients and returning phone calls.  Everybody feels they are my priority and do not tolerate waiting.  I'm usually in a near state of panic within an hour of starting.  My heart races, I sweat profusely and my chest tightens.

During the last week I've had an underlying calmness.   I'm still working as fast as I can to keep up but I've had no panic symptoms.  I seem to 'roll with the punches' better.   There are no intoxicating effects, if anything I feel like I have more mental acuity.   I can read and understand a medical record faster.  I can remember longer strings of numbers.

- My meditation has significantly improved.  I practice a meditation  based on observing my breathing.   Sounds simple but it's not.   For the last couple of years it's been difficult to keep my mind from wandering from the breath.  When that happens I count my breaths. 1-10 and then repeat.   Typically my mind would wander and I would stop counting at 3-4 breaths.

Since microdosing it's been easy to focus on my breath.  I can count my breaths 1-10 over and over without losing focus.   I've never been able to focus on my breath this long in 30 years of meditation (except when I attended a 10 day meditation retreat).  This cannot be attributed to placebo effect.

I was beginning to wonder how long I could continue working.  I've never bought lottery tickets until recently as I've been seeing them as my only hope to escape my work.   Now I have new hope.   Thank you to all the people involved with this forum for introducing me to microdosing.",53,2920,9,509,0
2021-04-08 15:56:03,Microdosing psilocybin helped me remember and feel happiness again,"I suffered from traumatic experiences as a child, so obviously the trauma really fucked me up. I have PTSD and a bad case of depression, which has been making me miserable for so many years. I lost faith in the medication, in everyone, and in myself, and for some time I was at rock bottom. I had tons of negative thoughts, low self-esteem, and basically destroyed myself. Then I started using weed and drowned myself in alcohol. It was a downward spiral, and for some time I thought there would be no light at the end of this tunnel.

But I know I can’t stay like that forever, so I looked for ways to help myself and found my way into using psilocybin which totally changed my life. In the beginning, I was a little doubtful about using it. I had my misconceptions and anxieties about psilocybin, so I held off from using it. I really thought it was going to push me down in a darker path or make me see abstract things floating before my head and shit like that. But boy, I was proven wrong.

It’s been months since I started microdosing, and the experience made me feel so light and wonderful, and I didn’t even realize how much weight I was carrying inside my heart and mind until it went away. It gave me a much-wanted break from the depression, the PTSD, and the shitty mindset and outlook on life that I have.

I wasn’t expecting much when I was just planning to use psilocybin. I thought it was gonna get me fucked or whatever, but it was different. I was numbed by my PTSD and depression, and this made me feel again. I know I might sound dramatic and all, but psilocybin does wonders, especially to sufferers like me. The experience made everything clear to me. Yes, I was broken and in pain, but I am truly loved by the people around me and I can feel that.

2022-11-25 13:20:49,58yr Woman - Microdosing has been a game changer,"Like many here, I've tried anti-depressants with mixed results, specifically Zoloft.  The feeling on Zoloft felt artificial, forced, and strained.  For years I've just white-knuckled a low-level depression.

I am about 3 months into microdosing thanks in large part to this Reddit sub.  Writing this post in case there are other older gals lucky enough to find this space.  I know you have questions.  In Canada, supplies are easy to get with a google search and a bit of research.  I hope it is similar in your country.

I started slow, 50mg each morning, and have moved to 150mg most days, taking a break for a day or two and then picking it back up.  I take pre-made capsules.  For me, early morning (5-6 am) works best.  I start to feel the effects about 1.5 hours after I take it.  The ""feeling"" lasts for about an hour.  I use this time to have coffee, journal - reflect. Then it's time to get in gear and start my workday.

There have been no side effects other than a 100% improvement in my mood and my ability to be a nicer human being - to others and to myself.  Every day is not perfect but I am finding a calm center that has always been missing.  These days I am grateful, I appreciate the moments.

This substance should not be illegal.  If you think this stuff is just for younger folks it's not.  Post-menopause is a crazy ride and we need all the help we can get.  If you know an older gal that seems to be in a funk - tell her about microdosing.",48,1463,9,273,0

2020-02-02 08:15:12,I'm currently bawling my eyes out because I just realised I went my whole fucking life being upset.,"Tl;dr - man microdoses magic mushies and realizes he no longer has to his life feeling hopeless.
I've been depression free for 2 months now. I'm making better choices. I've had spiritual awakenings. Strengthened friendships. Been a better son. A better brother. I've been sober for 6 days now. That's almost an entire week. And I can't fucking believe I've gone so many years being so depressed... Trying to kill myself. Trying to drink myself to death. Having fits of rage and taking it out on people I love. Making... So many negative choices... I'm crying. Because I feel like I've been freed. Like I've been finally released from my suffering. I can move on. And I just feel bad right now for that little boy that spent his whole life feeling like a worthless piece of shit when really. HE HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL. I used to hurt. So much. Everyday no matter what I did. I used to be full of hate that stemmed from hurt. I used to feel guilty all the time for no reason and it made me feel worse because I didn't know why and now that I know why... I can realize that my life REALLY doesn't have to be that way.  I've been making music. Beautiful music that makes me feel like I'm really... That there is something wonderful surfacing. I just realize I can be at peace and I can bring good things to this world and I'm not going to spend the rest of my life feeling hopeless and unworthy. Because I am worthy of love and hope and I'm a good person. 
Thanks for reading this, I just wanted to share this experience because. You hear that people cry on mushrooms and... Well I just did. And I wanted you to know why. 
Also If you're still here I want you to know that your life doesn't have to end. It might not have even started yet. No matter how old you are. I don't want to release my age but I will say I am glad that I found a treatment for my depression that works while I am still young with so many years ahead of me.

2021-04-14 09:50:24,Don’t let you convince yourself that the darker side of life is just reality,"I personally micro and macro dose to treat my depression symptoms. Psychedelics keep me on the right track and put me in a better headspace. But one of the consequences of living most of my life in such a negative headspace is that it makes it so hard to accept the happiness I achieve from psychedelics. In the time between doses or during the breaks I take, my mind slowly settles into old habits and I find myself thinking that “sober” headspace is just reality. That when I take these substances It’s just a temporary pick up. But that couldn’t be farther from the truth! The reality is that I have a mental illness, and I need to take medicine to treat it. So those of you reading and relating these words to yourself, don’t let yourself be fooled! The happiness you feel is real. More real than your mental illness. Don’t deny yourself inner peace.",76,854,14,156,0
2021-04-20 16:24:04,I didn't think microdosing was working. I was wrong.,"I started microdosing about a month ago due to increasing depression and anxiety. While I fully support the use of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds, I'm currently on a laundry list of supplements and prescriptions for a pretty brutal autoimmune disease, and just the thought of trying to find something I could take that wouldn't mess with my current regimen was exhausting.

Cue microdosing. I played around with taking it every day versus every few days, and after feeling like nothing was really changing, settled on once every three days. Thanks to this sub I knew not to expect big changes or differences, but I felt like maybe microdosing just wasn't the thing for me. Until I got into a heated argument with my husband.

I'll be the first to admit I'm a pretty reactive person. I've been seeing a therapist to be a better person for myself and my husband, but old habits die hard and I'm still not where I want to be. That being said, this argument was one of the few times in my life that I felt like I had complete control of my reactions.

Instead of having the immediate need to be defensive or lash back, I sat and sincerely heard my partner. And because I wasn't escalating, he wasn't either. And if things felt like maybe they were escalating, I had the capacity to set boundaries rather than jump the gun and fire back. What would typically be an argument that would most likely stretch several hours, was reduced to a relatively calm discussion that saved us both a lot of time and frustration.

My depression and anxiety might still be a beast at the moment, but I feel like my mind is finally going at a pace to where I can catch it. And even if it doesn't help my mental illness in the way I hope, the fact that it helps me see where I can be a better partner to my spouse is worth it.

2021-04-09 20:50:32,After a Year of MDing I Tried a Macro Dose of Psilocybin,"Micro-dosing has been a life saver for me. I want to thank everyone here. My PTSD was so out of control I don't think I would be alive without the information I have learned from you all. 

My problems haven't gone away and I still have a lot of work to do, but psilocybin got my feet under me so I could walk.

I decided to try a Macro Dose of just 2g. I blacked out the room, wore eye shades, and put on the John Hopkins playlist. I experienced full joy, I laughed, felt love, even felt loveable. It was so odd to feel good things. It's felt like I had lost the capacity to experience good.

I am in awe of the brain's complexity. I saw my ""no-self"". I floated in timelessness. 

It's only the next day but I feel lighter and more whole. I don't know what the future holds but I feel I have more capacity to meet it with openness and curiosity. 

MDing has helped reduce the intensity and temperature of my mental firestorm. The Macrodose so far seems to have put the fire out.

Just wanted to share my experience and thank you all. 

May you be well.

May you be at peace.

2021-04-06 16:28:14,Admitting defeat has been the hardest part,"I've learned so much from this group as well as other psilocybin pages and I'm grateful for everything i've learned. I started microdosing as an attempt to improve my very poor mental health in a new way, everyone seemed so positive and sure about its effects. I slowly tapered off my antidepressants and started microdosing. Unfortunately, after months of research and cultivating and resources, I ended up with another suicide attempt. The reason I'm telling you all this is to keep your expectations at a base level. Microdosing will not cure you of anything or solve your problems. It is a tool with which to expand yourself. I knew going into this it would be trial and error but some of us will just not be able to handle not being properly medicated and that's okay. You've not failed at anything so don't give up. Shrooms may not have been my savior but I learned SO much about myself in the process.

2021-05-19 03:15:09,Microdosing changed me as a human being and I don't even know where to begin about how to even explain it.,"If the last year taught me anything it's that mental health is no joke. I've suffered from, at different points in my life, mainly as a child, anxiety as well as recent PTSD from an incredibly toxic work environment. All undiagnosed of course, I work in the healthcare field and I in no way believe in any of our systemic institutions in place to deal with mental health in this country (America) and I'm speaking from my own experience in the healthcare field when I say that.

Anyways, I entered the darkest period of my life during COVID (like many other people) and was so lost. I was drinking heavily and smoking weed alllll daaay, errryyydayyy. I was at no point ever suicidal but I just fucking hated everything. I hated myself so much, I hated my family, I just straight up didn't care about anything anymore. Looking back I would say I was depressed, and probably have been for a while but nonetheless, mushrooms literally changed my life and I had zero expectations going into it.

I've microdosed mushrooms twice, I've stopped smoking weed and drinking as a vice and I've never in my entire life loved myself more. I find myself just wanting to cry randomly because I just feel so content inside my own head. I don't think I even knew what calm inside my own head felt like. Now, I eat only until I'm full then I put the food down. For context, I've struggled with weight my whole life but have managed to lose and kept off a significant amount over the last 15 years. I just feel so in tune with my body on a whole new level than I've ever felt.

To me, this is just another governmental control over its people. Our healthcare system, particularly our mental health system, is SO BEYOND FUCKED UP. It pisses me off to no end that the government and pharmaceutical companies are deciding how people can live their lives. I'm just ready for change.

2021-02-20 16:22:19,I've made the decision,"34(m) clean and sober since 10/1/15.

I began using psychedelics at the age of 16. Mushrooms and LSD. I had my fun, and thinking I was a rockstar, made the transition to heroin around the age of 22 and later on methamphetamine.

I shot heroin and meth for around 7 years. Living in agony and hating nearly every minute of the final 3-4 years... the only glimpse of serenity the first few minutes of a shot and the comfort I felt when I got the dope in my hands, knowing I would be 'getting well' soon after.

But there was one exception. I ran into an old 'friend' (acquaintance), who though living in a clean and sober house, was walking around with a vial of acid. Since lsd cannot be tested by practical drug tests he was taking advantage of any opportunity to get loaded/make money, as any active addict will do.

He offered me a hit, and reluctant as I was because I didn't have enough heroin to keep me well throughout the trip, it was free drugs so I accepted. We were at the local mall, and he dropped two hits on my tongue and then who knows how many, (probably 4-5) on his own, and also gave some to the other junkie I happened to be running with.

It began to kick in shortly, and it was uncomfortable. I hadn't used psychedelics in a while. When you're addicted to heroin there's rarely money left over for food, let alone 'recreational' substances.

We all parted ways after a while and I was left even more alone than I could feel in the most crowded of rooms.

I called the girl I would see occasionally, an ex girlfriend. An unhealthy relationship, but one I could count on when I wanted some company or needed a place to stay.

**I went to her house, but at some point on the way something miraculous happened...

My anxiety was lifted. The fog had lifted. I was fluid with the world, everything felt right. When I got there, while things are normally dramatic and argumentative between us. It wasn't. I wasn't.

We had sex and it wasn't the normal, animalistic ""I know I want this, this is good, but I can't feel much because of the drugs"" sex we would generally have. I actually felt it. I felt her. Her big tits were in front of me and they were the most amazing thing I had ever seen. She got off, and I lasted as long as I wanted, in complete control of myself and the situation.

I finished and we decided we wanted some snacks so I borrowed her roommates son's skateboard and proceeded to the local store.**

**And that was the moment. I hadn't felt like that since long before I began using the drugs that nearly ended me. I felt like I was a kid again, with the whole world in front of me. I had hope, I felt invincible. Again, I felt fluid with the world. I felt like I belonged, rather than feeling like I was taking up the space that other people should be using. I got to the store and everything was bright, everyone seemed to be happy and happy to see me. Social phobia was nil. I was just apart of this thing we call life.**

The night proceeded with waves of full on hallucinations and uncomfortable trips to the bathroom to 'rinse my cottons' in order to not go into withdrawal from the heroin.

The brilliant feeling I experienced subsided, and my miserable reality of the constant search for heroin returned. I never did seek out that experience again as, who could afford to do so when you've got a love affair with lady heroin to expense.

But, here I am. 5 years clean and sober. A successful career. I've been dealing with a dramatic shift in mental health for the past 2 years. Anxiety, depression, anhedonia. Meds, supplements.

I want that feeling again. I want to feel like I did before I put my life through a spaghetti strainer.

I don't quite know where to start, but I'll find a way to do this.

Could I have gotten and offer without MD? I think so. But it sure gave me a boost of confidence to help me get through 2 hours.

If you are like me and need the extra boost for the best first impression and think quickly, absolutely. 

Is MD magic pill for success?
Absolutely not. You have to prepare as well as anything else. It’s just that MDing gives you the edge and puts you at peak performance at will.

2021-01-20 19:24:41,Re: Heart Valve disease association with Microdosing Psilocybin,"&#x200B;

About a month ago I read and responded to a post (see link below) that worried me. I'm 56 , have been MDin every 3 days for 4+ years at about .18g. I stopped two or three times, but after a week or ten days, the gloomth began to move in. I continued to MD, which ushered it right out again.  After decades of depression with no relief from dozens of trad pharmaceuticals, this has been my savior. The Johns Hopkins Dr.'s concern (see article) so worried me that I stopped MDing. I concurrently made an appointment with a cardiologist and upped my daily meditation routine to 2x daily. The depression has not yet returned.  I reported here that my EKG was normal. A fellow redditor - a DR. I believe-posted that an EKG wouldn't show valve damage--what i needed was an echo-cardiogram. I booked one and promised to report back. Yesterday was the day and I'm happy to report it showed no damage. None. I plan to continue the 2x daily meditaion and will return to MDing on an as-need basis.

2020-09-04 15:25:20,I left the house yesterday for the first time in over a year,"-Sweet! Internet points! Thanks for the awards, kind strangers :) 

I had a whole story typed up but I decided I don't want to get too personal on here (at least not today).

Here's the TL;DR version:

I've been depressed/anxious my whole life and on SSRIs for 2 decades with very little lasting results. I've been a full blown agoraphobic for the past year. Three months ago, I got off my meds and started microdosing.

2 weeks ago, I spoke to an old friend on the phone who I'd been ignoring for a year (thankfully, she never stopped reaching out to me). Yesterday, I went to my sister's cottage for my parents birthday dinner (their bdays are 6 days apart). It may not sound like much but both of these things are miracles as far as I'm concerned.

The craziest part is how normal yesterday felt. My sister's neighbors even joined us for a bit and it was completely fine! I wasn't expecting this, but instead of just ""getting through"" the night I actually enjoyed it!

I dunno, I'm just feeling pretty grateful right now and wanted to share it with somebody.

Edit: my schedule is 250 mg with 1 g lion's mane every Tues-Thurs-Sat in the morning. Experimented a bit and found this to be the best schedule for me so far.

Edit 2: Just want to clarify that I'm also taking the 1 g lion's mane 7 days a week, not just on MD days.",60,1328,13,247,0
2019-04-02 07:56:35,I microdosed and it triggered psychotic manic episode within 1 week. I'm now diagnosed with bipolar.,"This is the story of how I experienced a psychotic outbreak, my thought process during the attack and afterwards. I think I was already predisposed to the illness as it runs in my family. My mother is schizophreniac and my aunt is bipolar. I didn't know that LSD could trigger it. It looks like LSD flipped a switch for me. I'm sharing my story so that other people can stay away from the drug if mental issues run in their families. Your feedback is appreciated. 

It all started with my curiosity to cure my depression with LSD. Before trying it I was using weed every day after work (1gr a day). I used to for 1.5 years. My life was basically work - home - smoke weed. I got 3 tabs of LSD and used vodka to calibrate the dose. I first did ~90ug to try if the lsd was okay and it turns out that I tripped mildly. It was my first acid trip and it went okay. I felt that I am connected to nature and colors were bright. No strong visuals, just trees breathing and talking to me. I went outside, enjoyed the nature, had a great shower, understood why people love trees, nature, etc.  My depression seemed to go away. I was feeling more motivated to work.

1 week later I microdosed with ~10ug and got a flight to my friend's in another city. It went fine. I felt a little bit of rush but it was all okay. I realized that I couldn't look at the PSP screen next to me on the plane. A guy was playing street fighter and I couldn't even look at it. I covered my eyes with my jacket on touchdown. 

My stay was great. I really loved the city and everything seemed fine. After 2-3 days I realized I couldn't bear the sound in a café, it was simply too much for me but my friend was fine. During this time I was sleeping less and I was searching why I wake up at 4-5am in the morning. It looked like it was enough for my body, little did I know that it could be a sign for bipolar. My thought procees this time was too diverse. I was too up, interested in different things such as symmetry. I organized my friend's kitchen because the spacing between items were not correct.

Flying back to my home, I thought that the items around me were not placed correctly. I thought I would create a new art form where you mark unnecessary items. I would call this ""aware*"".

I don't know how it started, if I slept at all or not. But it continued after I went back to home for 1 week. Symptoms started to intensify. I got panic attacks on the train as I couldn't look outside. I was marking the items on the street with my umbrella as they were not placed correctly. I mentioned that I was interested in urban planning on social media. I visited my friend in my home city and I was in a manic state. I, again, organized my friend's kitchen without their permission. I was speaking too fast and I was too up. 

There comes my psychotic episode. I thought that I found a cure to schizophrenia with my ex girlfriend. She was talking to me in my head and guiding me throughout the process. I called her on mobile, later I learned. I thought the apartment was a sandbox and it was a test area. I also thought that I was living in the matrix and my friends were calibrating my brain to transition into reality. When I went outside, the time could pass slower or faster and cars would slow down or speed up. This was fun.

I thought that everybody is managing something such as rain, wind, etc and my role was to manage time. This was such a burden that I was the chosen one. I remember going outside, walking in the streets and talking to everybody in the world because they were expecting a speech from me. During this time I gave the speech to the world, live streaming and my friends were with me. If I would say something wrong, they could stop me and make me say the correct words. 

I proposed my ex girlfriend to marry me. I did while doing yoga. I felt that all my muscles in my body were stretched. I was naked at this point. I did propose twice. Once at my place, and once I was giving my speech. My ex was managing half of my brain at this time and I was showing it to world.

I don't know if they were hallucinations or if I really went outside. However, I got really angry and I wanted to be left alone. This time I went outside, banging the door and shouting to people because I thought I was reborn. All the people I crossed paths with talked to me and I was saying ""yeah, okay, go on, is that it? Is that what you wanted?"". This time it was real. My neighbors were saying ""leave him alone"", and they called the police. Police cuffed me and put me in a back of a van. This was like a cage and I was screaming ""it hurts, slow down, stop"".

When they stopped, I was asking ""mom, are you there"" with the voice of a 5 year old. They put me in a bed and 2 police officers were on top of me. I was screaming ""I want to die, I don't want to die"". They injected me something and I opened my eyes in a mental hospital. 

I stayed there for 3 weeks and I don't remember the first week. I was not myself. They gave me olanzapine, clonazapam, and haloperidol. After 3 weeks I was out however things were not very well. I went to major depression afterwards. 

I'm now with my family for 2 months. My doctor said that I experienced a psychotic attack and got out real fast. I'm now diagnosed with bipolar. I'm on Olanzapine, sertraline and my doctor prescribed lithium which I will start this week. I'm spending most of my time in bed though I'm feeling a bit better. At least I don't have panic attacks. I don't know how I will manage my life with this. 

If you made to here, thank you for your patience.  Stay safe and sound!

2020-03-05 20:35:31,"If you start to feel anxious, some paranoia, panic attack or a negative thought loop starting, reach for the black peppercorn!","*Disclaimer: This may help those that have taken a little more than a microdose or if your really sensitive to psychedelics and you start to feel some anxiety or start panicking. Most people shouldn’t feel this way when taking the right amount of a microdose in which you feel comfortable and relaxed on, but since psychedelics can effect everyone a little differently this information may be helpful to you.* 

While recently taking a little more than my normal microdose of mushrooms and trying the lemon tek (on purpose), I started feeling a little anxious and then got stuck in this thought loop in my head. I had prepared for the day and whatever may come, just in case and so I remembered reading [this article about how black peppercorn can calm anxiety and paranoia when smoking cannabis](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/this-everyday-household-item-could-counteract-your-cannabis-induc) so I figured I’d try it. I sniffed the black peppercorn and put two inside of my cheek for few seconds and then chewed it up and boom! 🤯 Within a minute it got me out of the negative thought loop and anxious feeling. I was then able to refocus on positive thoughts and stay calm and at peace. Did a little meditation afterwards and had one of the best days ever!

Black peppercorn contains this terpene called [beta-Caryophyllene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryophyllene) which binds to the CB2 receptors in your brain. According to Wikipedia it's also found in higher amounts in essential oils like clove, rosemary, hops and even CBD oil, so you might have better results from those. I didn’t have any of those around to try except maybe for CBD, but I don’t think I have the most potent kind and it probably would take longer to get into my system and to my brain.

I plan on getting some of those essential oils to stack while doing my normal microdosing routine for added anti-anxiety benefits. 

Has anyone else ever tried any of those or the black peppercorn?

2021-02-12 19:36:32,I’m going to take something the rest of my life why not let it be psilocybin over pills 🤷🏻‍♂️🍄💊,"I am 27 male with bipolar. I understand that for the rest of my life I’ll be taking some sort of medication, because living unmedicated as a bipolar person will create more problems. Normally I’d be taking an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer.. yet instead I’m taking .75mg of psilocybin once a week to not just keep me sane but actually allows me to thrive in life. I’ve just been able to reconnect with friends, family, my job and all aspects in my life to be honest. I’ve been in my same job for 2 years and I’ve made more changes within those 2 years just by taking psilocybin my manger is wanting me to become an assistant manager. I’ve been much calmer in stressful situations, I have this mind body connection which helps out with anxiety, I can actually solve problems without asking others, I’m more confident in myself than I have been in years! I KNOW there’s no one pill that cures all but this is pretty close. Yet I will admit it did take me a while to finally understand psilocybin. At first I was taking huge doses from between 3g’s to 5g’s but eventually started to feel the amazing benefits of lowering that amount to a Microdose. I went from 5g to .70mg-.75mg with 30 minutes of yoga. I have tried the 1 day on and 3 days off method but sometimes that made me have frequent brain fog moments. That adjustment not only keeps me sane but also keeps me going even further in life with much less stress, anxiety and depression. There were good times and bad times but everytime I felt like I learned something more about myself and creating a healthier version of myself. I know there’s still research going for the benefits of psychedelics but I can truly say my life is better with microdosing. I know I’ll be taking something the rest of my life why not let it be psilocybin over pills? 🧐😄

2021-05-26 18:40:23,7 months of microdosing and my life has turned around,"After struggling with CPTSD, generalized anxiety and reoccurring depression for years, and after having tried countless antidepressants, I started microdosing in december last year.

My routine has been 0,08g / 80mg shrooms every three days, and curcumin(tumeric) & black pepper-extract every day. Curcumin is a mild MAOI that slows down the breakdown of psilocybin, which allows the body to absorb it better, and pepper does the same for the curcumin. 70-80 mg shrooms + 450 mg curcumin-extract +  2,5 mg black pepper-extract has more or less the same effect on me as just 100 mg shrooms on it's own.

I can for sure say that for me, this has been the best antidepressant I've ever used. Here are some of the things I've managed to do during the last 7 months:

* Quit nicotine
* Started working out more or less every day
* Quit watching porn
* Become more confident and calm
* Become less depressed
* Get back into dating and hooking up, after having too much attachment-anxiety to be able to be vulnerable in any shape or form and to be able to do either one for 2-3 years.
* Started feeling more grateful

The major change microdosing psilocybin has brought me is the ability to break bad habits and negative thought patterns, and to look at things in a new light. This has given me a new understanding on a lot of things and resolved some issues for me. It has given me the ability to think more rationally about the situation and calm down when it comes to attachment-style-paranoia, anxiety, racing thoughts, overthinking, etc. It has given me the ability to start new habits that has furthered my mental well-being, some of which are:

* Waking up early every day
* Working out every morning
* Taking ice-cold showers every morning
* Studying and practicing the philosophy of stoicism
* Writing a list of things I'm grateful for, every night, and reading them aloud
* Journaling to stop irrational overthinking
* Although not a habit in that sense, I discovered I had vitamin D deficiency, and taking vitamin D supplements has helped my mood.

...And much more.

Psilocybin, psychedelics, microdosing - it's all truly a gift. I truly believe this is the future for medicine when it comes to mental health issues.

This being said, I don't want people to just look at the list I made and think that starting microdosing is magically gonna make those things happen. I still struggle to an extent. There is no quick fix. It takes *work.* But microdosing can help you break old habits, get out of the rut, and get you started on the path to healing and progress.

2022-08-05 12:42:14,One “microdose” and I quit a painkiller I’ve been prescribed for 6 years - cold turkey. Today is one week.,"I suffered repeated, severe back and neck injuries in my late teens/early twenties. I was eventually prescribed tramadol for the pain, which had an unexpected and uncommon side effect of essentially curing my anxiety and depression for 6 hours at a time. For the last six years, I’ve essentially had a love/hate relationship with this medicine as I realized I was no longer taking it for pain, but as the only mood stabilizer that had ever worked for me. I had tried many, many times to stop, eventually weaning myself down to half the daily prescribed dose. Doing that effectively confirmed to me that it was no longer about the pain. But I was stuck, physiologically and psychologically dependent on these pills. 

I saw Alkaline Trio in concert last week. Just before we left for the show, my friend shows me a bag of microdose pills. I shy away because, “I’m not about to take mushrooms for the first time and go out in public.” Halfway through the set, Matt Skiba says over the mic, “If anyone out there is suffering from pain pill addiction, try microdosing psilocybin.”

Saturday, I took 3x .2g capsules over 120 minutes beginning at 12:45. My last dose of tramadol was 17:00 the day before. Saturday morning, I’m already feeling the discomfort in my body that signified it was time to take another dose of tramadol. I began my microdoses. Around 15:00 I’m beginning to feel very uncomfortable and as if it was a lost cause. My fiancée and I decide to go to the boardwalk, let’s just get outside. 

On the ride, from the passenger seat, I noticed a lone seagull flying above the highway we were on, and something fairly sudden happened. I felt as if I could sense the unseen doors that barred my path, and I could peek through the keyholes of all of them. We walked 5 miles up and down the boardwalk in blistering heat, and I realized my connection with the sun. Many other magnificent feelings and truths nudged at me and I felt truly, deeply happy. None of these feelings or sensations were so strong that I was ever unaware of myself or my state, but it was still very powerful. More so than I realized during the experience.

And then I woke up Sunday…still feeling truly, deeply happy. And that feeling persisted into the beginning of my workweek Monday, and lasted through the unrelenting heat all week.  

And at 17:00 today, I can say that I’ve gone 1 whole week without and opioid for the first time in so, so long. The withdrawal in the beginning was pretty awful. Everything ached. Like having a cold and a hangover at the same time. I drank lots of water and had a pretty insane appetite despite nausea. By Wednesday I felt pretty strong, and yesterday was the first day that I didn’t have a “craving” for my cure-all pill. It felt like clearing the final hurdle. 

To anyone who has hung in here this long, thanks for reading my testimonial. I hope the stigma associated with this medicine finds its way out the door so that everyone struggling with addiction and depression can get the help I’ve gotten without having to try the law and/or self-medicate. 

PS: I have taken another .4 microdose since my first, but mostly to assess the strength of this strain. I would like to walk myself up to a museum dose, as most of my hobbies involved creativity in one form or another. The .4 all at once was barely perceptible, so I think a .8-1.0 dose is in the near future. I am interested in a macro/mega dose, but not until I’ve locked in my set/setting/intention and sitter.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and encouragement. I apologize if this isn’t entirely appropriate for this sub, but this is where I did the majority of my testimonial reading before going ahead with it, so it felt natural to share it with the community that gave me the confidence to trust this medicine. I don’t feel inclined to share it with other communities; the feedback and camaraderie here have filled my cup. 

As I’ve said in a few replies in the comments, I know my dose was eventually* beyond a microdose, but I do intend to develop a .2g regimen that works for me and reserve museum level doses for times when I’d like to treat myself to something delightful. If anyone has any suggested .2g regimens - or a good way to develop one appropriate for myself - I’d love to pick your brain. In the meantime, I’ll keep poking around the sun and spreading the love. 🤙❤️",106,4379,20,789,0
2020-06-08 10:28:07,Awareness Campaign for Petition e-2534 - Decriminalize Psychedelics in Canada,"I am making this post to raise awareness for **Petition e-2534**, which calls for the decriminalization of Psychedelics in Canada. This petition has a scheduled hearing in the Canadian House of Commons later this year where it will be presented by Green Party MP, Paul Manly. From reports that I have read online, this petition will require upwards of **500,000 signatures** by **August 14th** for it to be something that is taken seriously by our Canadian officials. This is something that is achievable if we use the combined efforts of our reddit/subreddit communities, and personal social media to raise awareness for this petition and psychedelic medicine in general.

There are a number of studies that show promising medicinal benefits of psychedelics for various mental illnesses, alzheimers, and as addiction treatment. When combined with cognitive behavioural therapy, it has been shown that a psychedelic trip under the guidance of a therapist can sometimes equate to 10 years of standard therapy. For alzheimers, studies have shown that microdosing in late middle age can lower the risk of dementia by more than half; and has been shown to be an effective treatment for mitigating the effects of those already suffering dementia. In terms of addictions, psychedelics have shown to be an effective treatment for opioid addictions and may one day replace opioids for the purposes of general anesthetic altogether.

This being said, under the current system most research revolving around psychedelics are either under funded or blocked by bureaucratic red tape. Through decriminalization, we take a step forward towards destigmatizing psychedelics, and allowing research to be more readily conducted, therefore advancing the potential of modern medicine and treatment.

So here is what you can do to help.

For **Canadians,** please sign the petition if this is something that you support. Here is the link:[ https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-2534](https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-2534). If you choose to sign it, please be sure to share it with your family, friends and loved ones. The more support we can get the better. If you can make a post about it on social media, please do so. We have until August to make decriminalization a reality.

For **Non-Canadians**, you can help by raising awareness for the healing potential of psychedelics within your own communities and social circles. If we can start a conversation about smart, responsible drug use for the purposes of health and medicine, we will start to walk in the direction of making psychedelics more socially accepted. You can also start your own efforts, lobbying your own local governments and communities to create a petition similar to the one that is currently in Canada. Decriminalization shouldn’t just be a Canadian phenomenon, nor should speech about responsible psychedelic use.

To close, please support this petition however you can. As once we get the ball rolling on this, we can get the world talking about Canada’s new policies, legitimizing our claim to ground breaking medicinal treatments around the globe. Ultimately, none of this inherently means that psychedelics will be made available recreationally, however it might open the doors for real positive change in medicine and health care.

I will be working with some people to continue this awareness campaign on Facebook and Instagram @ rationalpsychedelics. If you’re interested in helping us out or learning more, this is where we can be reached.",77,3557,10,548,0

2022-10-22 17:11:27,"Change starts small. I started with brushing my teeth twice a day, and I completely changed as a person.","A while ago, I did a 10 week microdose cycle and it completely changed my life. About 4 months ago, I did nothing but sit at a PC all day, thinking about how much life sucked, and abusing cough and allergy meds to get high. I brushed my teeth maybe once every few days, didn't get any physical activity. I was so out of shape that my heart rate would shoot up simply from standing up for a bit.

At the start of the cycle, I kept up with my bad habits but slowly, very slowly, good habits began to seep in as my motivation increased. I realized how much I resented living in a state of disgust. I bought my own floss and began brushing my teeth twice a day, and flossing once a day. Then I realized how much I resented feeling sedentary and unfit. So I started doing pushups throughout the day whenever I got the motivation to, but with no pressure or routine.

I realized how much I enjoyed this, so I researched proper form and routines for calisthenics exercises and I began to start doing proper form pushups. I believe I could do about 4 until failure at first; then my routine eventually evolved into a full 3-day per week full body routine, incorporating supported pullups, squats, dips and pushups.

Then, I added even more exercises in and split my routine into two types: upper body and lower body. I am now doing about 40 minutes of intense exercises 6 days a week. I no longer feel depressed, and wake up looking forward to the day and getting physical activity in. Every week I get more motivation to keep adding to my routine.

Eventually, I hope to add proper flexibility training and meditation into my days, and maybe some light cardio. Take it slow, one step at a time, and you can look back after a while and see how many steps you've taken and it will drive you to take even more. I ran out of microdoses about a month ago but my motivation continues to increase every day.

EDIT: My schedule was as follows:

Weeks 1-4: 4 days a week, MTWTh schedule, .2g dose

Weeks 5-10: 3 days a week, MWF schedule, .2g dose

I believe that 3 days was more effective for me as I had more time for introspection, as the ""afterglow"" days seem to be almost as good as the microdose days, if not better for introspection.

2022-07-08 13:45:05,It's so fucked how LSD/Psilocybin is illegal yet highly addictive drugs are still so easily prescribed.,"I have anxiety, depression, and ADHD which I've been trying to manage through mircodosing. It does really help but I struggle to get hold of some so my mircodosing has been very inconsistent.

I decided to take the leap and visit a psychiatrist. I was completely honest with her about my feelings in hope to get an official diagnosis and some real help. Instead, after just 10 minutes of talking she decided to prescribe me with an antidepressant and Xanax. I already told her that I've had bad experiences with antidepressants and that I'm unsure about Xanax but she wrote me the script anyway.

Now I've spent some time online looking up Xanax and it's just freaked me out. Learning how addictive it can be and how people can die from withdrawal and all these other side effects and risks. And I'm just so amazed how willing she was to prescribe me this. 

Meanwhile, everytime I've mircodosed I've had no negative side effects or withdrawal or anything like that. It's helped me so much during the times I can get hold of some, even when I've been dosing inconsistently.

I know this is how everyone on this sub probably feels about the legality of these drugs, but I'm just feeling pretty shocked and upset about this just being the world we live in. Life is cruel",103,1268,16,226,0
2020-09-25 23:16:30,Do not confuse 15 mins (or 15 hrs) on the MD sub for a doctors MD,"TL;DR>! I have been seeing people giving advice to not listen to their Drs. But we cannot tell people to ignore their Drs or stop taking medicine because we think we know something we really dont. Listening to people on the internet who agree with you  just adds to your confirmation bias. And listening to that over Drs is how we get anti-vaxxers. Lets be better than that!!<

&#x200B;

First off, I know this will be unpopular and second, I personally have been MDing for over a year.  Also, I realize that the people doing this are the minority. For the most part, this is a great sub!

&#x200B;

I have been noticing it lately, and one particular post today set me off.  Someone is looking for advice on MDing for depression. They dont want to listen to what recommendations their psychiatrist is going to give them because they dont want to take SSRIs because they want to MD. Advice was given to not listen to their Dr and if they are prescribed SSRIs, dont take them so they could microdose. Or someone is taking SSRIs but wants to try MDing and people are telling them to stop taking their medicine to MD. Someone even chimed in that we ""know"" more about MDing that doctors. 

&#x200B;

Lets set the records straight. We dont ""Know"" a damn thing about MDing.  We do, however, know that therapy and anti-depressants help with depression. We have decades of research showing the benefit they have. Decades of research, but nah, lets listen to people that already agree with us on the interent. The best ""research"" we have is anecdotal or peoples personal accounts with MDing. THIS IS NOT LEGITIMATE RESEARCH. Articles like this are

[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2045125320950567](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2045125320950567)

&#x200B;

And you know what they concluded? We need more legitimate placebo controlled trials. The placebo effect is crazy strong and if you believe MDing can help, it might just be because you want it too. And we dont know that because we dont have that information. I know this is going to upset people, but  your individual n=1 results does not matter in the grand scheme of things. Im glad its working for you, truly. But dont think for one minute that means you know better than a trained MD. 

&#x200B;

But here is the great news. Psychedelics are what marijuana was years ago. Denver and Ann Arbor have decriminalized psilocybin mushrooms! We are doing research with macrodosing and depression.   
 But we cant extrapolate saying that a macrodose is helpful so microdosing is helpful too. What it means is that we have a new hypothesis to test. Hopefully the science will back us up in what we think is happening. But we have to be patient. If you want to find a Dr that is willing to consider MDing, they are out there and more and more will come around as science catches up. 

&#x200B;

But we cannot tell people to ignore their Drs or stop taking medicine because we think we know something we really dont. Listening to people on the internet who agree with you over Drs is how we get anti-vaxxers. Lets be better than that!

2021-07-27 02:06:49,"18 months in, Still going strong. Now I have something to say","TLDR - Relax, this stuff is nowhere near as scary as you likely think and maybe twice as effective.

I feel like this needs to be said, so I'm going to say it.

First... i'll tell a bit about me and my practices to circumvent any questions (they are all welcome by the way, feel free to post questions in the comments, i'm happy to answer them).

I started micro dosing (md'ing) shrooms about a 18 months ago. I still do it today (.2 grams per day, three times a week, no other stack, just shrooms) and have no plans to stop. I've been doing it pretty much religiously, and it probably saved my life. My severe depression is 85 percent gone. Yes, there is still an odd time when it creeps up, but it's mostly gone for all intents and purposes. My wife thinks i'm funny again, and i'm not embarrassed that my kids have to see me shriveled up with sadness. This post isn't about how it's helped me though.

I'm a late 40's'ish professional, wife, two kids, two dogs and a house. I appreciate and respect science and data. My history with non alcoholic drugs is mostly from college, but occasionally, i've been known to smoke some weed. I drank too much before I started, and now I don't drink much at all.

Ok, if there are any questions about the above, go for it... would love to answer any of them. BUT... the purpose of this post is something else.

I see a TON of questions about mixing micro-dosing with anti-depressant meds. I see a lot of questions that exhibit a curious hesitancy and fear. ""what time of day should I do it?"" ""What if i'm on KETO?"" ""What if I just got a divorce?"" ""Can I have caffeine?"" Etc. Look, I REALLY understand the trepidation, I was there. Originally, I went into this adventure very clinically. I read all the studies I could find, and by all means newbies should too. I asked a TON of questions, and all newbies should too. But I was too scared, and later, I found out... for nothing. Let's start there, It's natural for y'all to question and worry about the potential effects.

But, every time I see one of these posts, I want to take that person out to coffee and tell them that from MY EXPERIENCE... and I am not a doctor, or a researcher, but from MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, this is far far far less frightening then it needs to be. **Md'ing is nowhere near as scary as it we all think it is.** We are all so frightened because the actual big pharma meds do have weirdo interactions. These meds really change who you are and how you think, because they chemically change you. Many/Most of these meds REALLY change your chemical makeup. This is not the case with psychedelics (lsd and shrooms, I can't speak to the others).

What I want to say is that psychedelics are in my experienced opinion not like this at all. They don't change your chemical makeup. They don't change how you think. ***They give you an opening to change how you think.*** Psychedelics don't even stay in your body and mind for all that long. They are in and out in a day. But WHILE they were there, they gave you the opportunity to see what you've been missing. They give you a mental clarity. THAT is the magic, my friends.

I want to tell you that you can relax. Still do your research, still ask your questions. But if you've wanted to try this but are nervous, I want you to relax and know that at least one one guy, OP on this here thread with 18 months of microdosing experience, is of the opinion that this is so innocuous. And there are thousands of us with experience that feel that way. I feel so confident in their safety, that I wouldn't hesitate to offer md'ing to my own kids if I felt they needed it. I believe it's totally safe, and I believe it's beneficial. Essentially, I think of md'ing to the psyche as coffee is to your energy level.

Relax my friends, and try it if you are ready. Once, twice, or even more. If it's not for you, I promise that you won't have ruined your life. The upside for me was my life. That's what I gained from trying it. MY LIFE.

I guess that's it.

Your anxiety and depression can be better. I promise. Mush on friends.

2021-03-18 16:06:00,Microdosing psilocybin has crushed my weed addiction.,"I am 21 years old and been addicted to marijuana since I was about 16 going through binge phases and sometimes was able to only use it at night. But it always lead to binge eating, poor quality of sleep, mood swings, my short term memory was so horrible. I work construction and my ability to problem solve was that of a 10 year old. I quit smoking and switched to only thc gummies for a while until my shroom guy had these microdosing gummies (250mg pslyocybecubensis) per gummy. And my ability to handle stressful situations and anxiety has been so much better. 

I find it has given a gentle push to make the right decisions throughout my day. The right decision makes more sense and is easier to follow. I guess I can say with certainty if I am feeling anxious or stressed I take a gummy ( usually doses about every 2 days ) within 30-45 mins I am more calm and that lasts for about 48 hours(:

2020-12-30 09:46:04,MD'ing shrooms has given me a clear head after 28 years,"Ever since I can remember, my mind has always been running. I was diagnosed on the autism spectrum when I was 10 which cleared some things up, but my mind has still been a constant barrage of thoughts and more annoyingly, a constant monologue.

Without going into details, this year hasn't been great (for anyone). Ended up with me catching covid in October and just having tremendous self doubt about my dating life, career, studies and social life. I had trouble focusing on work or even enjoying anything since my mind would just run off and I'd be reminding myself why I wasn't good enough.

Then I decided to buy a shroom growing kit on a whim. Had a decent harvest and started experimenting with different doses after finding this subreddit.



My mind is finally free. I can enjoy silence, I can recognise when my mind wanders off and actually let go of it. There is no harsh self judgement about every little thing. It's like a radio that was just slightly out of sync and now the static is gone. 

I can cycle through town, walk through a park, look out my window or just walk around my small apartment that's filled with plants and just experience it, appreciate it and enjoy it.

TLDR: Meth and other amphetamine addictions, Xanax addiction, pregabalin (physically) addicted.

Results after 4 days psilocybin: no meth, no other amphetamines, NO CRAVINGS!! 

As for the pills it's a little different, but there are significant changes;

Xanax: significant decrease in consumption; acceleration in tapering towards complete detox!

Pregabalin: (physical addiction with some of the worst withdrawals I've ever felt) - from 6 pills down to 2 almost instantly. EXTREME ACCELERATION TOWARDS FULL AND COMPLETE DETOX!!!!!!! 

THIS IS INSANE! 

These results are unimaginable and those who do not know of pregabalin addiction please research how difficult it is to get off of.

From amphetamine addiction to absolutely 0 basically after sleeping, is just phenomenal!

2020-12-08 18:42:14,Old Guy Checking In After Starting MDing.,"I don't have a particularly novel experience to report with MDing. I'm older than most and have a lifetime of dealing with a spate of mental illnesses; none of which are helped by coming from a time when we didn't talk about them. I've been prescribed drugs   and like most meds (for me), they have pretty much stopped working. When I told my doc, HE suggested I investigate MDing.

Finding the mushrooms was not rocket surgery in my area, so I started with .1 grams every three days while continuing with the less than effective prescription cocktail. 

The changes came quickly: better focus, more energy, better mood, and enhanced creativity. Now, a couple of months in, some more profound changes are happening. 

I'm pissed off. Not tossing chairs through a window pissed off, but more of a WTF have I been putting up with this shit? I was hoping for more compassion. I seem to be developing boundaries and seeing gaslighting and being taken for granted, rather than just sweeping them away. But, my love for those who have appreciated and helped me is growing.

The suicidal ideation is at an all-time low. I'm self-employed, so I have the need for a couple of hours every morning to rise above the depression built into my life. That's down to about an hour. Yesterday for the first time in decades, I woke up without the oppressive list of things I need to do spooling off into my mind. This is usually accompanied by the idea that if I just walked off a bridge, none of this would matter. Yeah, that was gone. 

My sex drive has gone nuts. As I said, I'm older so that means I do not have as many friends my age who are still sexually active. Though it is nice to feel that part of me so alive, I know that I can come off really creepy. I find I am parsing my comments before speaking them, especially to people younger than me. I think the MDing has made me more sensitive (compassionate?) to how people perceive me. 

And all this is just after a couple of months!

It makes me furious when I think of the suffering these fungi, which grow fucking everywhere where I live, could alleviate. But, it appears a new era is upon us with decriminalization trends and scientific research mushrooming. Rather than get-off-my-lawn angry, I'm now speaking the truth with that energy.

I'm sorry that this has already run long, but I feel that I need to say hallucinogenics have to be approached very cautiously for those with mental illnesses. DO NOT stop other prescribed meds and keep in mind that hallucinogenics can give you a view into your own mind. Start slowly. Mine is a bit of a horror show, and seeing it all at once would not have gone well.

2019-09-02 02:51:15,"MD’ing psilocybin has cured my depression of 27 years, among other positive things.","Warning, this got long.  TL;DR at bottom. 

I (42, M) began md’ing psilocybin about 4 months ago.  I take 200mg every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  They’re kind of weak from a potency standpoint so I’ve found that around 200 mg is good for me. (Side note: I’ve grown them myself so I’m working on isolating better and more potent genetics, but that’s a whole other post for a whole other sub). 

I had suffered from depression for 27 years. I’m now 42 (M).  Saw a therapist for a few months at the end of high school but that was about it. When your father was a Vietnam-era Marine who grew up on a working cattle ranch, feelings weren’t talked about much.  Men in our family sucked it up and dealt with our shit in silence. I’ve never taken medication for it. Just suffered in silence.  

Had some good years, and had some really bad ones.  The last few had been the worst. I had actually begun planning my suicide. I had decided on a helium bag. That was how I was going to do it.

About 2 years ago I began to become interested in micro dosing psilocybin after coming across various articles and studies explaining its efficacy in treating depression (among other things).  Back in my teens and early 20’s I had taken recreational doses of both psilocybin and LSD, so psychedelic voyages were something I had prior experience with. It had just been about 20 years since I had done them.  I knew that some of my most profound insights had come from these drugs, so I was intrigued when I began researching psilocybin micro doses for depression. 

I live in the PNW and my plan was to try and find some mushrooms in the wild. After failing at that for two seasons, I decided to cultivate my own and I had my first doses ready by early spring of this year.  My capsules ended up holding about 175-200mg per and I took my first dose in April of this year.  I’ve taken them 3x per week as stated above and take the weekends off. 

I cannot explain how, but four months later I’m pretty much cured of my depression.  I struggle to put into words how this has happened, and I’m also trying to understand my newfound feelings of happiness. I haven’t been regularly happy in 25 years, so I’m still becoming acquainted with those emotions. 

I’ve also quit smoking.  I was addicted to nicotine for 28 years. In high school it was dip, since I played sports. In college it was cigs. And then after college it’s been a mix of one or the other over the years, going back and forth between chewing and smoking. Both are truly disgusting habits. 

But for some reason I just said “I am quitting smoking” and I did it. Cold turkey.  Coming up on two weeks quit and I can honestly say I don’t even crave those fucking cancer sticks one bit. I can be around my friends that smoke/chew and I don’t give a single fuck. It’s weird.  I just refer to myself now as a former smoker. I will not smoke another cigarette or take another chew ever. 

But I’ve also put in some personal work in addition to the micro doses. I quit drinking alcohol 402 days ago. I knew that alcohol was a powerful depressant and it wasn’t doing my depression any favors. So I quit that shit too. I gained some clarity, and began seeing my mental struggles from a different perspective.  I was still depressed after quitting the sauce, just a little less depressed with a clear head. 

The drinking was not hard to quit since I didn’t have a problem per sé. It was always a social thing. But the shrooms played a massive role in my rise out of depression and smoking cessation, and have helped to harden my resolve in keeping on my current path.  

This is all just another anecdotal experience shared on the internet. But I feel so strongly that the psilocybin has been the driving force behind all this, I now tell everyone (who I think might be receptive) how
much they’ve helped me.  I’ve since been very open and honest with those around me about my struggle with depression all those years. I think it’s vitally important to bring mental illness and the benefits of psilocybin to the light, so I preach the gospel of this to whoever is receptive to the message. 

I also own my own business, and my business performance has increased dramatically.  I also no longer get anxiety about client meetings. The other day, an uninsured driver smashed into my car while it was parked out in front of my house. Totaled it.  I just shrugged and said, “Yes, this is a serious burden for me but what can I do?  What’s done is done.”  The driver doesn’t have two nickels to rub together so legal action would’ve done no good. The point is, I’m taking life as it comes, and not worrying about things beyond my control. I’m more accepting and open to life’s curveballs and take them in stride.  Insurance ended up paying out $2500 more than what I paid for the vehicle so it ultimately turned out fine, but I wasn’t bothered by it at all during any time of the ordeal. 

I’m also physically more productive with my work. My workspace is clean and organized. I meet my deadlines. I’m just more “with it” because of the psilocybin MD’s. 

This stuff is MEDICINE. And it’s very powerful medicine. I feel I have a new lease on life.  Life could not be more opposite for me than it was 6 months ago.  Hopefully this strikes a chord with someone who is researching micro dosing psilocybin for depression/anxiety.  It has made a world of difference in my life. 

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. 

TL;DR:  Micro dosing psilocybin for 4 months (and two macro doses in that time) has cured my depression of 27 years and I’ve stopped smoking cigs and no longer drink alcohol. My business and personal relationships have improved. I am an overall happy person.",83,5699,13,1039,0

60 minutes in - The jitteriness is starting to settle and I'm beginning to feel more relaxed. I'm feeling extremely happy, happier than I have been for a while. I guess this is a good sign.

2 hours in - About to go for my run. Aiming to run 4-5k, however it’s getting dark and it’s raining so I’ll see what I can do. Full of energy, can’t wait to get running.

2 hours and 40 minutes in - WOW. Just finished my run. Managed to run 4.3k in about 24 minutes. Felt like I could run for hours. Feel absolutely amazing, like incredibly euphoric. It feels more natural though so it’s not like the sort of euphoria you get from a mind-altering substance (even though that’s what I did). Hopefully I make sense lol. Gonna take a shower now, listen to some music and relax :)

4 hours and 30 minutes in - Super relaxed. Listening to music feels wonderful. Just really really contempt and feel present in the moment. Will update once more before I go to bed and then I will do a mock up tomorrow with my overall thoughts.

10 hours in - Well what an eye-opening day. I'm going to try and get some sleep now and will follow-up in the morning. Thank's everyone for following.

# Day After - 15/11/2020

Okay, so today is the day after my first microdosing experience and I thought it would be beneficial to give you all my overriding thoughts on the experience. Firstly, I think I probably took too much. Although I did feel in control at all times, it did definitely feel like I was on something. I think a true microdosing experience is supposed to make you feel better, but not so much better that you feel ""high"" in a sense. So I think for the next time I microdose, I'm going to half it and take 0.1g. It's going to take a few experiences to try and figure out my optimal dose which is fine because I have faith and patience in this substance.

With a .2g dose, these are my pros and cons (not necessarily negatives, but aspects I think people should be aware of).

**Pros**

* A sense of well-being throughout the day (anxiety was down to a minimum)
* Feeling present in the moment
* Feeling compassion for others
* High energy (for the first few hours)
* Great for exercising (honestly I cannot stress this enough, it feels absolutely amazing! Incredibly therapeutic!)
* Puts your mind at ease (I will go into more depth at the end)
* Food tastes great (Don't know if anyone else can relate to this)
* Music sounds amazing (you will literally start dancing by yourself in your room)
* Pure contempt and relaxation towards the end of the day
* Many other mental benefits

**Cons (Like I said, not necessarily negatives)**

* Didn't feel all that social, but not in a negative way. If someone wanted to talk to me, then I would talk to them back no problem. However, I much preferred just relaxing and meditating. Maybe this differs from person to person though as we're all unique. I have heard that microdosing LSD can make social situations come at ease so I may need to experiment with this.
* I went to the supermarket to see if I felt comfortable being around other people in an enclosed space, and to be honest it was a bit of a hindrance. I'm not the biggest lover of food shopping and I just didn't feel comfortable around people that I didn't know whom were just getting on with their daily lives, I suspect a lower does would be better in this situation so I don't feel that uncomfortableness.
* At the does I took, I had no motivation to do monotonous tasks. For example, I tried to do some research for an essay I have to complete for University and it was not fun. You have to be creative. Listen to music, exercise, meditate, work on a project you're excited about. What I did was work on some artwork as I am a passionate designer and want to pursue this career in the future. I was incredibly focused and with music playing in the background, it was pure bliss and incredibly satisfying.

Finally, I just want to go into more detail on one of the benefits that I found with this experience, which was putting your mind at ease. Anxiety is a mental condition that has been swept under the rug for far too long and hasn't been spoken about enough. Now I have dealt with my fair share of anxiety, even at 21 years old. Anxiety, or depression, doesn't discriminate, it can affect everyone. I found with this experience that I didn't have any concerns, worries or negative thoughts in my head. That little voice that stays with you all day long, judging your every move, was muted. Of course, this isn't a magic pill, so it's not going to completely remove it, however, it's not constantly on your back, it's just sleeping.

I can't believe this plant is illegal. The solution to calming our mind and looking positively on the outlook of life is right there in front of us and we've decided to ignore it. Just absolutely preposterous.

I would definitely recommend microdosing psilocybin. I must stress as well that the plant only does half the job. You, as a human being, also has to take some responsibility and respect the plant. As I said, it's not a magic pill and it won't suddenly solve all your problems, but it's an extraordinary tool that can have major benefits. I may do a similar report like this when I next microdose which will be half the dose of this experience. Thank you for reading.",22,6149,3,1137,0
2021-06-08 11:25:01,Exercise + Cold shower with microdose,"I have recently came across something so amazing I have to share it with you all!

For the feeling of pure bliss and just inner power, this is something I absolutely love while microdosing :

1. Exercise - this can be anything that's really gets you pumped up! My favourite is a combination between HIIT and dancing (shuffling)

2. Cold shower - next is the cold shower, put on some of your favourite music that really gets you in great mood and feel free to dance and even sing if you like

3. Meditate - by now you should be feeling refreshed and amazing. What I love to do next, especially if its a hot and sunny day is to go outside (inside if its not great weather) and set a timer for 20/30 mins. Just feel the heat and take time to just enjoy, listen to the birds and sounds of nature.

Sending love from the UK, I hope you all have a great day!",37,852,6,166,0
2020-07-29 09:19:56,That LSD is illegal is criminal,"I've been microdosing LSD for one week and this shit feels good. I feel my mood enhanced significantly. I feel more satisfied, confident and optimistic than usual. It blows my mind that this good molecule LSD is illegal. I think governments have no clue what they are doing.

Did politicians try microdosing? They should.

It feels so backwards herp derp that this is illegal.",31,376,6,64,0
2020-09-16 14:46:36,Homeless man book tip!,"I was having a bad day, I was sitting on a bench in a touristic area of the city (it wasn't too busy because of current circumstances), trying to read a book as I try to calm the angry emotions I was feeling.

""I hope that is Ranbindranath Tagore you're reading."" I looked up and saw an old homeless looking man, smiling at me. I said, ""I don't know who that is!"" and wanted to get back to reading my book but all of a sudden I realised that the man is being kind to me and ignoring him would be extremely rude. I quickly followed up with, ""is that a famous writer? What was the name again? I will look him up."" 

He repeated the name and told me that he read a lot of Tagore's work back in the 70s when he was younger and found the sight of me reading a book ""beautiful"". We chatted a bit, I thanked him for his kind words/reading tip, he wished me a good day and walked away. 

That short 3-4 min interaction with a man I would have otherwise ignored uplifted my mood and as a bonus, I looked up the name Rabindranath Tagore and found a treasure of literature and art worth exploring. 

A microdose saved me from being an asshole towards a very kind man and rewarded me with a treasure of literature and wisdom ready to be explored, thanks MD!",22,1245,4,243,0
2021-05-17 12:22:01,Microdosing as a cure for binge eating disorder,"I struggled with my obsessive eating/binge eating disorder ever since I could remember.

This rooted in my childhood, because I was often alone as a kid. My parents were hardworking and never gave me and my sister the attention we needed. Eating became a coping strategy for me to fill loneliness, reduce stress and numb emotional pain. My BMI is well over 35, which is considered obese. Weigth, weightloss and healthy eating were a very unhealthy obsession for me, resulting in low-selfesteem, multiple crash diets, feelings of failure and shame. That's until I discovered Psilocybin.

I started using Psilocybin mid-Feb. First microdosing (which I still do) but also macrodosing. Ever since I started microdosing I haven't had ANY strong urges to binge eat, which is unimaginable for me. It's like I no longer feel the need to stuff my face, I can just eat when I'm hungry. It's crazy what this has done. I'm also not obsessing with food and weight as much as I used to. I am losing weight gradually now. Slow and steady wins this race. Mainly because I no longer binge. It's also not an obsession anymore... Macrodosing took me to the root cause of my problem (my childhood) and showed me how I can fix it.

I thought I'd share this story for anyone out there who has the same struggles, because I know it's hard and you can feel alone sometimes. But please know that there are others out there as well. You are loved!",47,1421,8,251,0
2021-07-12 04:11:20,"Mushrooms are just crazy, these incredible things are saving my mental health.","I'm on week 8 doing 0.3g 5 days on and 2 days off. I just started incorporating the dose with my morning cocoa brew. I have found that on my 2 days off that I'm feeling incredible. I put this down to the mushroom having me think over my thoughts in greater detail, on my dosing days I will stop and think about negative thoughts when they arise. I look for reasoning behind why I'm having them. I'm asking myself should I let these thoughts actually impact my emotional health, this is resulting in me just laughing as I can't pin point actual reasons why I should be feeling depressed, for instance I was reading a book that I was really enjoying, the book is a straight up whimsical fantasy book and I started getting negative thoughts, feeling down. I stopped reading and focused on the thoughts and just broke out in laughter. I had absolutely no reason to feel down. I was reading a great book that I was loving, the negative thoughts disappeared, this is a very common occurrence on the 5 dosing days, negative thoughts occurring in ridiculous times that make no sense and then disappearing immediately after I basically call them out.

On the 2 days off my negative thoughts are basically non existent, unless warranted, if my favourite football team loses. I feel down, but it passes instantly, random negative thoughts during ridiculous times are gone, on these 2 days I'm finding I'm incredibly more engaged in life, constantly looking to learn more about things that interest me, even my interests are expanding, it's been an incredible experience so far. I thought I would be relying on the 5 days on and the 2 days off would be torture but it's somewhat reversed and even the 5 days on are not that terrible, there very much showing me how stupid the depressive mind can be which has been entertaining lol

I have been through actual therapy sessions many times with psychologists and it feels like I'm doing it again but this time my psychologists is the mushroom and they are working me though my thought and showing me how I should be really thinking.

0.3g is my sweet spot, anything higher than this I can see it interfering with my everyday tasks.

I plan on going another 8 weeks, hopefully this great experience continues.",78,2243,12,399,0
2021-05-28 22:43:31,Goodbye (For now),"
I took some lemon tek last night and holy fuck was it eye opening. 

I remembered how awkward I was when I started high school (who wasnt). This was when everyone was getting thier phones and I remembered begging my dad for one. I wouldnt stop asking and trying to make deals with him. So aftet a while he just bought me one. I was extremely excited. 

I remember being on it everyday and night.  I would download simulators and play gta liberty city for hours a day.  I'd use this phone until 2 am on school nights.  It got really bad.  The worst part about all of this was that I used my phone as an escape from reality.  Whenever things got awkward or uncomfortable I would bury my face in my phone. This led to a really bad feed back loop of avoiding responsibility.  While my classmates went through the ringer of life and failed but also grew, I avoided everything like the plague.  I would immediately go home after school isolate myself and go on YouTube.  Ray William Johnson was my go to Channel. 

Because of this I never really develop as a person. Im still awkward as fuck most times, my conflict resolution skills are sub par and my discipline levels is next to zero. I feel stuck as a person. 

So what did the great mushroom king make me realize?  Get rid of this damn smart phone. 

Immediately after posting this, im switching my sim to a flip phone with basic features.  No reddit, no insta, no avoiding reality anytime soon.  I will be raw dogging life for the next 6 months to force myself to embrace and deal with reality.  No phone to grab and forget reality.  Will it feel weird? Yes. Will I be bored sometimes? Obviously,  who isn't?  Regardless of what happens, I have to stick with this phone for the next 180 days.  No exceptions. 

The purpose of this goal/ punishment is to force my self to get out of my comfort zone and deal with my problems and grow as a person. 


I am so thankful that I had this realization now at 23 without having to lose something valuable. 


I love This sub and everyone in for introducing me to this beautiful plant. Its been fun reading your experiences and I hope you all well on your journey for you have made mine so much clearer. 

Peace ✌ and mush love.",17,2219,3,412,0
2020-09-17 17:27:18,1 Month of Microdosing,"I thought I would share a little about my journey with microdosing so far. I've been Microdosing for about a month (psilocybin). Apologies in advance if this is long!

Before I began my microdosing journey, my general issues included Severe Depression (including many days where suicidal ideation occurred. More often than not I was thinking about my own death, and not in an existential kind of way.) They also included Anxiety, PTSD, and probably some undiagnosed ADD/ADHD. Intrusive Thoughts were something I had resigned myself to living with. They happened every day. I felt completely powerless against their spiral down into suicidal ideation or anxiety/panic attacks. Every single time they won. I had lived this way since I was about 12. It was normal. Accepted. ""Its just the way I am."" That's what I told myself over and over. 

I had doctors tell me I needed antidepressants, but I hated them. They didnt remove the negative emotions. They removed EVERYTHING. Or made me feel crazy. So my options felt like: want to die but feel real emotion, feel no emotion, or feel so crazy emotional I cant function. Awful choices as a young adult and teen, so I opted to at least let my suffering be real. No meds to mask it. Even therapy felt fake, like it was just a setting to appease my need to feel validated (something I struggled with). It felt like every therapist was just agreeing with me, but never actually helping me progress. After years of therapy, my mind still hated itself as much as it had before therapy.

Eventually I found shrooms. I took my first macro dose, and that opened the door to micro dosing. I began growing my own medicine, and I fell in love with the process. I could feel the connection and the energy in the fungi. I knew even before my first Microdose that this would be very different from western medicine.

The first day I took a microdose, I knew this was how I wanted to work through my issues. For the first time since I was 12, the intrusive thoughts lost their power. They still happened, dont get me wrong. However, instead of spiraling me down to some very low points, I was able to acknowledge the thought, and then dismiss it. It had no power. It didnt control me. I controlled it. It felt like the first real breakthrough I had ever had.

Then after another week, I realized my meditations were more effective. I had a meditation session where I was able to tell myself I loved myself. In spite of my flaws. That those flaws were okay. For those who have looked into Jung, it was meditative shadow work (so I was ""speaking"" with my shadow). I cried. I felt a release of emotion, release of anxiety, a release of self hatred I had held onto for what felt like my whole life. I forgave myself. And for someone like me, that is incredibly difficult. I beat myself up more than anyone else ever has. But I forgave myself. I did more successful therapeutic work in that meditation than I ever had in therapy (but I am NOT saying to replace therapy with MD - it just worked better for me).

It has now been a month. I have had comments from many family members and friends that I seem more happy and positive. I've been told I seem more emotionally stable. I FEEL more emotionally stable. I feel like I understand my emotions and thoughts better. I'm suddenly finding myself doing real self reflection, questioning my motives, re-thinking my actions. I've been able to have real conversations about my emotions and mistakes in the past (including overreactions and defensive reactions) without the stress or the anxiety I had held before. I feel lighter. I dont feel the weight of my own mind, and it allows me to think about things that matter. How can I better help my family? How can I show my partner I appreciate him? Did I respond in a kind way when we were discussing X, Y, and Z? For the first time in my life, I can hear my own thoughts, and they dont hate me. That, in and of itself, is more than enough reason for me to microdose.

For those of you who are curious, I do every other day, and I take 0.2g of Golden Teachers in a capsule in the morning. Sometimes I use honey I made to take my microdose on toast (there is no mushroom flavor of you're wondering). And yes, I have these effects even on my off-day. The effect is not specific to days I microdose. It is an actual change that is happening, and I intend to continue nurturing this change.

Hopefully this was informative for some of you. Hopefully some of you could connect with this, and maybe it spoke to you. If not, that's okay too =) I wish you the best of luck on your own journey!",22,4603,4,842,0
2020-02-24 15:53:17,Microdosed mushrooms for anxiety for the first time yesterday. I finally felt normal again.,"I tried microdosing for the first time yesterday. It was 1g of psilocybin wet. I have panic disorder as well as general anxiety. I keep reading that microdosing isnt a miracle cure but its effect yesterday has left me at a loss for words.  

Sometime around when I turned 18 I developed anxiety and depression. I always feel unsatisfied with everything and Im constantly stuck living in my head. I have a hard time living in the moment which led to my panic disorder as well. My vision even seems dull most of the time like I need to open my eyes wider but cant. But yesterday, I felt normal. I hung out with my kids at the park and just had fun. I usually feel extremely anxious if there are a bunch of people but it just didnt bother me. I was finally living in the moment again. I could feel my mind start to recede back into thinking too much but it was easy to recognize and stop the loop. I couldnt believe it. The dull feeling in my vision was gone too. I felt like I was just enjoying life again. 

At the end of the day I still felt a little anxious as usual but I meditated and stretched before bed. This is my usual routine but it felt much easier to fall into the meditation and calm my mind.  Im not sure about how much of all this was placebo but I will try to get on a regular microdosing schedule once my mushrooms are dry. Just wanted to share my md experience and see if anyone else has had something similar. Have a good day everyone!",91,1453,14,282,0
2019-10-03 21:58:52,"Opinion: I believe most people that take ""microdoses"" of psychedelics are actually taking mild doses.","According to Fadiman's work and others on microdosing, a microdose is ""sub-perceptual"" meaning you don't notice anything perceptually different about your reality. Some people speculate that because it is sub-perceptual, it might simply be a placebo effect (I doubt this). When I'm reading about people's experiences microdosing, I often see people say there is a very noticeable shift in their perspective, this, by definition, would make it not a microdose. 

Personally, I've microdosed a few times with little effect. But I've noticed that a mild dose with subtle perceptual changes, such as, increased vibrancy, and noticing things that my sober mind would not be aware of, I've had really positive effects that lasted up to a week, sometimes longer (often better than a large dose). 

I am just posting this because I think if we continue to tout sub-perceptual doses as the most beneficial way of utilizing psychedelics, then we might discourage individuals who see no effect from microdoses.",101,999,15,159,0
2022-04-23 00:47:33,Diary of a mad black man,"I noticed my irritability had gone way up. And as someone who's fairly patient I thought this was weird but chalked it up to 'maybe it's just some weird side effect'. What I've now come to see though was that the mushroom was unearthing these dormant, bottled up traumas and pain. I realized that the anger I'd pushed down and away about the pain in my past had wanted to be known, to myself. I'd always thought of myself as a go-with-the-flow type of person and often been referred to as 'easy going' but the truth was that through abuse my personality had gone underground on some level. Only revealing this child like fun self to those that I felt like I could really trust. I was afraid to take space. To have wants, demands, boundaries.

&#x200B;

I'd been angry just laying in bed, watching the experiences of my past replay in front of me over and over, I couldn't sleep. I'd been punishing myself with these thoughts. Partly because I'm upset for not advocating for myself, and secondly allowing those people that hurt me to still be in my life. I'm not totally out of the woods yet with these feelings. But! Microdosing has taught me some potent lessons of being patient with my pain, to be the voice and adult of my inner wounded child , and lastly that I deserve kindness. That I deserve, we all deserve, to be treated fairly and lovingly. I feel like I've been healing the relationship with myself. And it's so fucking awesome, I'd never really loved myself in this sort of way and I just wanted to say that I'm proud of myself. And to whoever may come across this post, just know there are other people like you. Suffering feels so isolating but the truth is that there are many, many people in the world feeling hurt, who have hurt. And have transformed their interior world, into a more habitable one.

TLDR;

It's gonna be ok

2020-10-28 18:37:24,Things i have learnt after a year and a half of micro dosing psilocybin.,"Hey everyone, after a year and a half of micro dosing i just wanted to share some of the most important lessons i feel have learnt. I now feel as though i do not need to take as often as these simple things have helped me tremendously.

1. To not be afraid of things you cannot control. Focus fully on the things you can.

I know this is a cliché but, i have become much more pragmatic. I see things as problems and solutions. I now carry a notebook with me continuously and any time a problem arises i right the problem down and figure out the best solutions i can think of to deal with it. This has helped my anxiety a lot! 

2. Art cures nihilism.

I have started drawing, making music, and also started a clothing brand where i try to express myself fully! Its lit lol

&#x200B;

3. I have become more knowledgable about myself. Things i like, my values and morals. This has been really helpful because it has helped my identify others that are like minded and develop strong connections and friends that make me happy!

2021-05-11 08:29:49,Mission succeeded: Beating depression with microdosing,"Hey all,

I just wanted to share some positive news regarding the microdosing results for my girlfriend's depression. She hit rock bottom in January, due to covid, injuries caused by sports and her depression. As a last resort we decided to buy a growkit, and within a month she started her microdosing routine: microdosing on day 1, two days off, and 4th day microdose again. Afterwards again two days off, microdose day, rinse and repeat for 8 weeks. After the 8 weeks she didn't microdose for 4 weeks again. Within a week of microdosing I personally saw significant improvements in mood, which kept increasing throughout the 8 weeks. Less covid anxiety, less anxiety in general, it became easier for her to contact friends again, she seemed a LOT happier in general, less stressed out, more motivated. The list keeps going on. After the 8 weeks routine she felt fine for 3 weeks and noticed that she slowly started slipping again. Right now she is on her second 8 week microdose protocol. However, at the end of the 4 weeks break she had still significantly improved compared to before the microdosing. 

In addition, besides just microdosing she also uses daily reflection excersises, keeps a healthy daily routine and has a ticklist to stay motivated throughout the day. All the self-reflection together with the microdosing is really having its effect. As her boyfriend, it seems to be that mostly a lot of unhealthy thinking patterns had to be processed and deleted. Im just very thankful that such a beautiful tool exists, and I want to tell to anyone that microdoses to combat depression that it's worth it. Stay on the routine, do daily self-reflection and you'll start noticing effects. Hang in there, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel and I hope that microdosing gives you the salvation you are looking for. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help in any way possible.",54,1911,6,330,0

So over a month in I kept thinking I could only go so far, without my wife knowing. So I asked her if she noticed anything different. She said I am the funny man / joker she remembers when we dated. And I am WAY MORE PATIENT with the kids. And not a moody prick when on the midnight shift. She asked if I drive on them and I said no which is the truth. She said if they turn you into a loving happy husband and father go for it. I hated sneaking around her back like that. But I needed to know if microdosing even worked for me.",39,863,8,172,0
2020-09-06 16:13:03,This morning I took 0.5g psilocybe cubensis for the first time ever.,"I swear I'm seriously going to throw all my antidepressants into the garbage. Because that's precisely where they belong, they're pure garbage. Why would I keep spending money and wasting my time on all that pharmaceutical crap when nature has the best antidepressant.

For me this microdose has absolutely zero psychedelic effects (which was exactly what I expected). I just feel so energetic and focused, I think I'm going to explode with so much energy overflowing inside my body. I am feeling HYPER. I mean, there's no other word to describe it, it's just hyper. Hyper everything. And yet, I'm not ""manic"" or anything (I'm not bipolar, I'm dysthymic). I don't feel like doing anything crazy. I just want to... be. I don't know, just be... alive, I guess? This feeling is blissful and almost overwhelming but... at the same time it's mellow and peaceful... it's not like a ""ritalin"" energy. Not like speed or meth or any HYPER drug. It's a very peaceful, deep, NATURAL energy. It doesn't feel like anything otherworldly or alien or """"""cosmic"""""". It just feels like... nature. It feels like this is how I'm supposed to feel. It's powerful, it's kind and it's loving.

I just feel so... ALIVE.

Thank you SO MUCH nature for showing me what love and peace feels like.

THANK YOU SO MUCH

Edit: I really did 0.5mg (i.e. 500mg). I'm not quite sure where you need to draw the line and say ""ok this is no longer a microdose"", this isn't rocket science really. In any case I'll be doing it twice a week (sunday and wednesday) as long as it works for me.",68,1548,12,274,0
2021-02-28 11:17:54,First day microdosing psilocybin - I feel like Karl Pilkington,"So I'm trying out microdosing today. Not so much for myself, but I want to help a depressed friend out, but she's a little too nervous to use any 'drugs'. So I've decided to test it out myself and keep a diary. I've used normal doses of magic truffles before, so I wasn't nervous for this.   

While in a supermarket, writing pieces for my diary, I kept having urges to come up with jokes. Dry observational-jokes   
I'm seriously reminding myself of Karl Pilkington, who's a top 3 person who've ever existed.   
Well, if I remind myself of one of the best men alive, the psilocybin is putting in some work! Who wouldn't want that?",62,631,10,114,0

I went from being completely and utterly dead inside to having so many emotions I can hardly stand it. I come close to crying almost everyday. Everything makes me emotional. I feel motivated on so many levels its I can hardly even stand to be at home anymore. Nothing feels the same anymore. It basically renewed my humanity.

Edit:  I agree the article doesn't seem to be written as well as it could have been. I believe what they were getting at was the fact that some mental conditions like depression and anxiety can be manifestations of overactive negative self talk or negative thought loops and the psilocybin inhibits or reduces that negative emotions processing. It obviously does not cause us to ignore negative emotions in general. ",88,535,13,73,0
2022-06-09 14:01:20,You need to do the mental work too,"I posted about [my recent success](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/v3djah/2_weeks_inand_life_is_beautiful_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from microdosing psilocybin and some people commented saying it made them sad that they haven’t had the same experience or benefit. After sitting down this morning, expecting to list out the 5-7 changes I’ve made in addition to the medicine, I was blown away with how much work I’ve done over the past few weeks. So, I wanted to share this as a motivator and to perhaps help others out in realizing you need to do the work alongside the medicine. This is not an easy journey, but it’s so, so worth it. Here’s my list of what I’ve changed in my life over the past 3 weeks since I began to MD (in no particular order & almost all have already become second nature to me):

Here is my list of life changes I’ve made over the past month that have increased my mental well-being:

* Journaling
* Mindfulness & research on interesting topics applicable to personal growth
* Exercising 5 days a week
* Super food smoothies for breakfast & lunch. Smaller dinner portions. Fewer carbs overall & no refined sugars
* No eating after dinner
* Going to sleep at 11pm every night & waking up at the same time the next morning
* Only using my phone for essential tasks & never scrolling social media
* Leaving my phone at home when I’m with my family because I’m physically with them & there is no emergency situation I could possibly have to tend to
* Turning off all device notifications except for phone calls from anyone or texts from my wife
* Meditating
* Reducing my time sitting at a desk working down to only 3 hours a day
* Making mornings about myself & my goals
* No caffeine in the afternoon
* Microdosing psilocybin & adding mushroom supplements to my daily routine
* Allowing myself to be “bored” or just lost in thought not dictated by any outside forces
* Reading/listening to books
* Listening to information driven podcasts
* Listening to my mind and body. If I am working and begin to feel mental fatigue, I take a break. If I am exercising and my body isn’t feeling strong that day, I won’t get upset about it and know it’s okay because I am still getting the work in
* Allowing my brain to chemically rebalance naturally after waking up so no coffee until I have been awake for 1 hour
* Only drinking alcohol during specific social situations and never on my own
* No longer setting any goals that have to do with material possessions or money
* Not allowing myself to feel any worry about the future because we cannot predict it
* Not feeling regret on past decisions because I would have made the same decision under the same circumstances every single time
* Focusing on living in the moment because the present is the only time we ever exist in
* Never reading or watching the news",34,2872,8,505,0
2020-09-22 05:53:15,Micro-dosing has changed my life,"I started micro dosing at the start of the year. I have manic depression, PTSD and OCD. Since I started dosing, my depression is next to non existent, I no longer have PTSD episodes and the OCD I can now control. All of this has resulted in me building a startup and pitching to investors. Yesterday that business received a seven figure valuation and investment all in just six months and I am now able to live my dream as an entrepreneur. Not only that but the relationships I have with friends and family is incredible all while spending loads of time hiking and staying active.

LSD has taught me how I can live my life in an alternate way, it turns down the noise and negativity of life and paints a clearer picture. Happiness and success IS obtainable. My dream is to reinvest into psychedelic research so that hopefully one day it can help others as it helped me.

EDIT: few of you have asked for my regime. Quite simply I dose ~10ug to ~25ug whenever I feel like I need it, I can go 3/4 days without dosing but equally the longest I’ve consecutively dosed was around 2 weeks. I like to throw a nice 50ug day in after breaks to give myself a new perspective and channel my direction (I’ve pitched on a higher dose and it gives me a considerable edge). The biggest factor I think is my wife knows everything. I find it very helpful to to talk to her through how I’m feeling and to keep me in “check”. Notice the small things and enjoy the experience!",32,1456,5,273,0

The thing is. Unlike anti-depressants, It doesn't make you less anxious. It shows you the way, or in other words: it shows you 'how to not get anxious'. Which is way more valuable than 'masking' your daily issues",63,264,10,47,0
2020-05-06 13:59:03,1 year md anniversary. Life changing results,"This time last year I had accepted defeat, I just came to terms that I was just a depressed fat p.o.s to put it lightly. I had just beat a DUI case and also got off my 3 years of probation. So as you can see I already wasn’t doing so hot. I had no intentions of finishing college  and had just adopted the “I tried everything but can’t loose this weight” mindset on top of quitting a really good job for basically no reason. I was disappointed in myself and felt like I had a dark cloud over me, and couldn’t seem to shake it. I spent a lot of my good years being a drug addict and was finally clean but was still somehow fucking shit up left an right. Then I came on here and started reading peoples accounts of how md helped them with anxiety and depression. At this point of my life I had to get places 15 mins early to just mentally talk myself into doing what ever I had to do so I was really desperate. 
The first few weeks of trying md were total bliss, I felt like a veil had been lifted up from me, the stormy clouds were gone in my mind. I started positive thinking and got OBSESSED w watching ted talks and DIYs on YouTube instead of mindless show, I started going outside again and exercising and just enjoying nature.I even started working so hard at work I got 2 promotions in a 3 month period. I would take my self on what I called “personal dates” and I’d go to museums, botanical gardens, science centers, etc. and things were going amazing.
Then...the repressed memories and trauma starting surfacing. This was a very bumpy road, I had things coming up from my past from when I was 4/5 yrs old. Awkward things I had to confront family about in order to heal and move forward. I took a 3/4 month break from MD at this point and I think that was a good choice I was getting a little bit too “out there” talking about other dimensions and was trying to get everyone to md. (Looking back my initial md doses were defiantly too strong hahah)
But I started to get my doses a little bit more accurate and started again and fast forward 6 more months....I lost all that weight. Enrolled in college (been on the deans list the whole time) and now I eat healthy all the time, go on bike rides daily, and I also grew an obsession for hydroponic gardening during all of this and now my garden is flourishing! Md really fucking saved me from self and showed me how to love again and let love in. We are all the light, sometimes we just need to be reminded :)",44,2463,7,477,0

2021-03-11 20:03:57,MD causing existential crisis?,"I truly don't know if it's related but it just seems a little too convenient that after I start using shrooms, I feel deeply disturbed by the state my life is in. There's nothing inherently wrong with me or what I do, I just feel so empty. I do the Mon-Fri job and pay my bills like a good little girl and I fucking loathe this existence. I can't help but feel my subconscious screaming for me to listen that this is not what we're meant to do. We're meant to convene with nature and respect each other and our surroundings and feel grateful for experiencing humanity. That's not what any of this is. We're born, we pay bills, and we die. And we've been told that to think or do otherwise would be madness. I just cringe at the thought of melting my brain behind a desk for the next 40 years never feeling or experiencing anything, always wishing I were somewhere else. Maybe I'm just having a 1/3rd life crisis or maybe I'm just whiney but I can't be the only one who feels like this.",30,985,4,188,0
2021-03-27 23:23:39,I just tripped on a microdose!,"I literally can’t believe this just happened!! I’m currently on and documenting Paul Stamet’s NPLS Protocol (Niacin, Psilocybin, Lionsmane - Stack) I’ve been on the stack for 5 weeks and I haven’t tripped before. Today, I did something different. 

The days when I’m on my stack I’ll wake up pop the lionsmane and psilocybin then 10 minutes after take the niacin to flush. Today, I took the lionsmane and psilocybin in the afternoon. I got distracted while watching the Portugal vs Serbia game and decided to make some soup. After I ate my soup, I felt like an apple but, where we have our fruits,  we have some of our vegetables too. So in the same bin, I saw an onion and decided I felt like having the onion instead (I’m weird, I know lol) I cut up the onion, put some salt on the slices and ate it. A few minutes after I ate the onion, I remembered that I didn’t take my niacin and went to go take the pill. Shorty after, I’m sitting in my room and I realize I’m having “shroom thoughts” and giggling and start to get confused and wonder wtf is what’s going on?! Apparently, (and I didn’t know this before) onions contain natural MAOI’s that increase the potency of mushrooms. It was insane! The trip felt like the comedown of a regular trip without the hallucinations. It was awesome, so I decided to go for a walk and the most important lesson I learned from that trip is... Look around - cause we tend to miss the hidden “easter eggs” in our daily lives. 

Anyways, I just wanted to share! It definitely threw my day for a loop today! Have a great day and happy dosing!",30,1576,6,293,0
2021-03-31 19:38:57,Took 2 months but now the affects hit me daily and I’m so happy.,"I take ground up shroom capsules every Tuesday/Thursday since February. Before I was super depressed and stressed, I would sleep until 4pm. Cry a lot, negative thoughts, distorted self image, drank and did coke 4-5 days a week. Never was home. Didn’t eat right. I’ve tripped before and knew this wasn’t me but I was fighting an inner battle.

The other day I had a random “shroom” thought, something along the lines of “I’ve been really childish in that way lately, I should stop this” or “I should let him know how much I appreciate him”. I’ve started doodling and even brought out my journal. I didn’t write because I got distracted, but it’s a start. I want to vape (ugh) less. And when I smoke weed it’s almost a mini trip, lots of interpretation and deep thinking, cleaning. Life is good and I am happy. I’ve missed this feeling and didn’t think it would work...I forgot what it felt like to not be depressed. It’s amazing.

2019-10-23 17:42:45,Darn it Reddit I am just a different person after MDing for 6 months. And I love it.,"For years I've enjoyed small doses here and there, but after truly discovering the nature of psychedelics this summer and having a truly profound mushroom trip (10 grams of Cyanescens alone in the dark), Ive been micro dosing ever since and Im just a completely different person, for the better. I smile all the time. Music means so much more to me now (And Ive always been a music lover). My empathy has increased 10 fold especially towards my students. I see people get frustrated and angry at the smallest things all the time and it seems so foreign to me now. I just wish they could feel the love that Ive been feeling. Nothing really angers me anymore. I dance all the time now, alone in my apartment, sitting in traffic, at work during prep blocks. It blows my mind how much of a positive effect these little mushrooms have had on me. Ive always been a stress-about-tomorrow- kinda guy and one of the best changes MDing has shown me is that one can be much happier and more content if you live in the present moment.

My motivation and productivity has also skyrocketed. Any goal that I have set for myself, I just HAVE to meet it to the best of my ability. Like, I find joy in working towards my goals. To put it in perspective, before my trip, I had about a year left to complete my masters degree...... I am currently writing my thesis and will graduate in 3 weeks. Procrastination has become a thing if the past!!

I have become WAY more social. Ive always been introverted and smoking weed daily definitely doesn't help that (quite the opposite, rather). But now, wow. Every weekend I am just looking for the next adventure to go on with my friends, even if its just meeting for tea and chess, I love just calling my family and talking and telling them that I love them. I consider a day to be great simply if I can make someone smile and feel good...... I have almost completely forgotten what its like to be angry and frustrated. My parent mentioned just last night how loving and happy/calm Ive become. I just smile and say thank you (wish I could tell them my secret but I never will). My little sister even says Im like a big loving teddy bear now haha (Im a fairly large guy at 6ft 190lb). I love this new me ❤️ I dose at .1  every 3 days with a month off every few months with the occasional 1-2gram trip and I don't think Ive ever experienced something so life changing. I believe everyone should try this medicine out.

Edit 2: Someone reminded me of something I forgot to mention!

Edit 3: Guys, Im all for having private conversations. I love all the questions in my DM and the subsequent conversations that come from them, but If your purpose is to ask me to help you source psychedelics, unfortunately I cannot help you. There are ways to get what you want with just a little research. Asking a random on reddit is not the way my loves ❤️🍄☮️",84,2890,18,536,0
2021-02-03 03:33:00,5 months microdosing update,"Hi lovely microdosing community,

I started microdosing 5 months ago after a rough break up and it really has changed my life completely. I wanted to tell you all a bit about how it's changed. Prior to microdosing, I KNEW all the wellness things. I studied CBT and mindfulness, been in therapy since I was 18, did the inner child work (held the baby in group and all) learned breathwork, yoga, meditation and KNEW enough to manage my anxiety and depression (diagnosed with Asperger's and CPTSD after a childhood of fear, shame, and punishment). The keyword is MANAGE. I had become really skilled at managing my thought distortions, noticing my triggers, self-regulating, and using my skills on a day to day, hour to hour basis. IT WAS SO MUCH WORK. And although I was grateful for the skills, I kept wondering when I would finally just embody them. When I would finally just feel at peace. Would the day come? Would that even possible? Was that just a thing monks on a mountain experience? It did get gradually easier, but NOTHING like what I've experienced after these 5 months. I mean I did 20 years of work in 5 months.

Now, I feel peace every single day. Like, I am not even kidding. How is this even possible?? HAVE I REACHED ENLIGHTENMENT? Is this self-actualization? lol, probably not, but it feels good enough for me! The first couple of months I would notice myself being triggered and feel a bit pulled by it. Then, the triggers just stopped. I just do not care and not in an apathetic kind of way but in an understanding kind of way. I found God during this whole process and I had been a lifelong Athiest and even started an Athiest organization when I was in college! Hitchens and Dawkins all day. Now, I literally feel deeply connected to God and everyone and everything. I feel deeper compassion for myself and those I meet. Time has slowed down between stimuli and reaction to the point that I can insert understanding between them most times. I feel deeply present with what I am doing and have kicked a huge screen addiction (Netflix+Youtube) out of my life. I journal, dance, do yoga, play my little drum, read, paint, color and relax each night. I am a peaceful mother, and not by struggling through mental discipline, but by just being it ( I happen to be a peaceful parenting coach, but through mental olympics in the past).  I started a composting bin, a garden, making medicine, calling friends, and getting things done off of my ""I want to do one day list"". My sister no longer triggers me. Nor my dad. Or my daughter's father. There is just peace. I don't feel pulled by things I ""should"" do and instead do what I feel inspired to do. It's been such a blessing.

Anyhow, I am a single momma and I wish all mommas had access to this beautiful medicine. My goal now is to advocate for it in my state to see if one day it's possible to legalize this healing fungus. In full disclosure, pairing this with A Course in Miracles made the process even more powerful for me.  


Edit: For mommas who want to push to make changes in your state, I started this subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MomsforMushrooms/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MomsforMushrooms/). I've never started a subreddit or know what I am doing, but I figured I would get the ball rolling for us mommas who are seeing a difference and want to push for decriminalization. :) I'll post on there later tonight!

2019-11-22 19:43:43,Graduated with my Masters Degree yesterday a full year before my slated end date. I have to give MDing a shout out for this.,"Ive always been a focused and driven person. I work as a teacher and ever since I was little Ive always been a studious person. I enrolled into an accredited online university to finish my Masters and the first 6 months was rough. I actually even made the decision to quit for a while at one point earlier this year because of life and stuff. Lost a lot of motivation to complete my degree. After some soul searching I decided I would see it through, but take my time with it so it wouldn't stress me out. Cue the mushrooms.

I had an EXTREMELY profound trip about a month after deciding to continue with my post grad (10 grams dry of cyanescens) and started micro dosing about a month after that trip. All I can say it that MDing has worked wonders when it comes to my productivity. The love and empathy and interconnectedness that came with it also was/is amazing, but thats another story for another day. If I set a goal for myself, nothing and I mean nothing could keep me from reaching it. I went HARD on my degree, writing 20-30 pages a day after work, studying for hours on end, etc. Im glad to say that I graduated with a Master of Science: Curriculum and Instruction degree yesterday and I am seriously on top of the world. I was slated to finish next summer but every day when I would get home, I just couldn't feel comfortable until I gave my all at whatever assignment I was working on. I just couldn't feel at peace with myself unless I knew that I gave every ounce of effort for the day. Granted, I went in to micro dosing after extensive research and with my intentions (including increasing productivity) set. I cant give MDing all the credit, as Ive always been driven and focused, but MDing mushrooms brought it out of me 100x over. 

Guys, I went from a lost youth stressing my single mother out tremendously, getting locked up (no record fortunately), running around with knuckleheads, getting drunk every day at 17, robbing/stealing, to teaching middle school at a great school and now graduating with a Masters degree and setting my sights next on purchasing a home. The look on my mother's face when I sent her my graduation notice made it all worth it plus some. She cried and I cried with her. I cant tell enough how these little fungi have helped me reach the point in my life that Ive wanted to reach, and I implore all of you to at least try this amazing psychedelic medicine.",124,2404,24,443,0
2021-09-13 15:43:42,My Experience Microdosing with Social Anxiety,"I’ve been taking 200mg of mushrooms for about 2 months now. I have severe social anxiety, to the point where I haven’t been able to walk into stores or go to school because of my anxiety. I started taking anti-depressants about three years ago, which came with a lot of negative side effects such as suicidal thoughts, extreme agitation, and really just feeling numbed out in terms of my emotions. I managed to get off my antidepressants within 3 weeks of microdosing, and I am now feeling better than I have since I was a worry free little kid. I work in a grocery store so I need to deal with being around people all day which can be very hard for me. Since I started MDing I feel like a different person. I am much more social, and I no longer have the constant tightness in my chest along with the very fast heartbeat I would have to deal with during my entire work day. Psilocybin has basically cured my social anxiety, and done more than the doctors could in three years with three different antidepressants. I thought I would never feel normal again after dealing with SA for so long, but here I am feeling better than I can ever remember. Thank you everyone on this sub for your posts and information that led me to start microdosing, and I hope other people out there can experience the same positive effects I have.",45,1325,6,245,0
2022-10-23 18:13:56,I'm getting ME back.,"Been microdosing for 2 months, a lotttt of crying, anger, grief etc. was waiting for me as soon as I had opened the gates. Thought I was doing something wrong first, but luckily I stumbled upon some posts claiming the opposite - that it's just some good ol' emotional spring cleaning going on.

I was very timid with dosage, so I danced around 0.050 - 0.100g most of the time, and roughly stuck to the 1 day on, 2 days off schedule (can't remember which one of the influental guys lended his name to this particular regimen).

Today, I felt some bravery creeping in and did a 0.250g dose (after chickening out of a 0.500g dosage, finding out what I am actually comfortable with as opposed to what seems ""cool"" and ""strong"" is one of the lessons I was able to apply right there).

And so many beautiful things happened. Seems like after all the spring cleaning, I finally made my way through to some fun stuff.

I can listen to music again. Full body chills. I used to have them all the time, thought it's gone, thought I was irreversibly changed...

Turns out I just needed some good thorough, gentle healing.

I giggled, laughed, spoke my mind. Might've found my sweet spot, since these seem to be the parameters I read about on here.

I love experiencing my return step by step. I love that I chose microdosing over doing full dose. I love that it's multiple seasons watching me gradually blooming back into life, instead of one giant mind fuck that would reassemble me on the other end like in a Star Trek teleport machine, too much for me to comprehend, and analyze, and most importantly: Speak about. (Or write about, in this particular case.)

I love sharing this with you. I love sharing my experiences in general. This is me. I was always there, just needed some time and love.

I am so glad all the hippie sayings actually do ring true. Bet my whole life on them when I had nothing left. And after disgustingly hard months of agony, pain, and hopelessness streaming through me, I am back. I jumped and was caught. By myself.

Thank you for letting me share this with you. Peace out ♾",20,2092,4,381,0
2020-08-02 16:15:04,1 week of microdosing - decade+ long mental health issues GONE.,"Hey all! I see some folks posting their experiences so I thought I’d share mine.

**Background**

I’m a female who recently turned 25. I’ve had depression, anxiety, and ADHD for as long as I can remember. My symptoms probably peaked when I was a teenager - I was close to committing suicide. Now, after years of therapy, meditation, yoga, spirituality, etc, I have gotten a good grasp on the thoughts that don’t serve me and letting them go. However, they still cloud my perception and it takes active effort to not identify with them. I spend a lot of my headspace overthinking or cycling in neurotic loops. It’s quite exhausting, having to actively notice and correct myself that “No, I’m not worthless” “No, I didn’t fuck everything up” “No, I shouldn’t kill myself, my life is precious and people would miss me” etc.

While I’ve worked deeply on my trauma, I continue to struggle with self-care sometimes and my rapid thoughts tend to leave me in a state of catatonia. My theory is that, while my conscious thoughts have been largely addressed, my subconscious is still very self-destructive. Uprooting the subconscious is difficult, and the closest I’ve gotten to accessing it is in meditation retreats and through psychedelics.

**Psychedelic History**

I’ve taken acid countless times now. It was the first psychedelic I tried. While fun and informative, I never felt like it was worth pursuing in a deeper way. I’d take it to have a nice, euphoric time and connect with the friends I tripped with. I certainly learned a lot, but the teachings seemed more “head-y” and “masculine” and didn’t quite probe me in the way I needed.

I took ayahuasca earlier this year, which altered my life (a story for another day). Through it, I took the idea of plant medicines and psychedelics as a vehicle of spiritual healing more seriously. This is important, because I think it lead to a different intention for my future shrooms experiences.

The first time I took shrooms, I had a panic attack for 6 hours and couldn’t breathe. The second time I took it (a year later), I felt so emo and contemplated jumping off a cliff. As a result, I wasn’t inclined to revisit them lol. After taking ayahuasca though, something was activated in me and my subsequent 3 shrooms experiences (all of which happened somewhat recently) have been extremely healing. I think my first shrooms trips were overwhelming because I couldn’t let go and trust the spirits to elevate me - I was still stuck in my ego.

**Microdosing**

I’ve known about microdosing for a while, but I didn’t feel like it was relevant to me. After the past few weeks though, where I took shrooms twice and acid once, the idea grew that microdosing shrooms may be helpful in my journey. I had never taken less than a usual trip-worth.

I picked shrooms for a few reasons:

-	My last time tripping on them felt eerily similar to ayahuasca
-	To me, shrooms is visceral and activates all the tension, gunk, and trauma that’s carried in our bodies (re: Body Keeps the Score)
-	It accesses my unconscious in a way I don’t logically understand. I don’t need to get it though and I sense I’m not supposed to, especially since I rationalize a lot
-	It’s “natural” rather than synthetic (re: stoned ape theory)

I’m on day 6 now of microdosing ~0.08 to 0.12g.

The difference is subtle yet profound. 

Nothing in my life has changed, yet everything has. The empty void that sucks the life out of everything I do is still there, but somehow I can see how beautiful it is and it doesn’t impede what I do. I feel how that vacuum is actually part of my ability to connect deeply with others and the world, that it’s one side of the coin, and the other side is God. These are all things I “knew” consciously through mindfulness but couldn’t feel in my being. Now it’s being embodied.

I am more present, I don’t overthink, I am in my body. I can simply be without worrying about everything. I feel inspired to do more with my life for the betterment of the world. I am interconected.

All of this happens at such a subtle, unconscious level. So even though my day-to-day hasn’t changed, I feel like I am the person I’m meant to be, when the gunk is cleared away.

I don’t want to get ahead of myself, so I plan to continue microdosing for at least a few months to gather more data points. So far though, I’m shocked at how effective the shrooms are. I’m hoping that taking them like this for a while can help rewire my neurons, ones that have spent a lot of time stuck in trauma responses, and letting them relearn the joys of being.

Feel free to ask any questions! I hope my post is helpful. :)",63,4630,11,830,0

I do have experience quitting as I went a whole year without relapsing until my mental health took a big dive over the summer. My mental health is starting to stabilize and while my mind still wanders and makes me feel like shit I’m quicker to catch it and move onto something else rather than let it crush me for days or even weeks.

2020-02-03 21:42:51,Got sacked today but I couldn’t be happier.,"I’m almost 40, have an amazing wife and a delightful 3 y/o in an expensive and small NYC apartment, and today I lost my job. But I am smiling from ear to ear. 

I’ve been fighting anxiety and lingering depression for years, but recently I started MD with psilocybin and I haven’t felt this calm, positive and stable in years. 

Even today after losing my job, my mind is actually excited about what is next to come. I feel supported and confident that whatever happens next, is gonna be fine. Better even. 

Normally, I would have retreated in a cave ruminating what just happened and project my anxiety to my environment. Not today. I feel like reaching out to people, starting projects and sharing my voice. 

These last 5 years have been brutal. 5 years of trying to start a family ($100k lighter but eventually got there naturally), a failed startup (best lessons ever) and various moments of ‘let’s get a divorce’. I always thought something wasn’t right, and at peaks of anxiety I noticed my thoughts got really dark. Self-doubt, loneliness and emptiness only increased when times were tough. 

Negative thoughts have been running in my family for generations. My family has never really spoken about this in the way we should have so I never connected the dots. 

It was only this year that I decided to do something about it. Therapy helped a bit, meditation helped a bit, healthy lifestyle helped a bit (not drinking really helps!), but MD has given me a reason to think I can actually beat this. 

If you’ve been reading this post so far, that means you’re interested in solving this for yourself or are on a similar journey. All I can say is, this MD stuff is ground breaking. 

I started by really reading up on the topic and then started to grow Psilocybin myself. I recently started to experiment with the recommended low amounts, and am beyond excited to restore my happiness and resurface my true me. That happy, joyful and kind hearted me I know is in there. 

Commit to creating your own path my friends, there is a way out away from the darkness. 

Be careful, respect the plant and do your homework before you action.

2021-05-10 22:44:03,Microdosing parent,"I worked from home yesterday and decided to MD. (I don't MD on a schedule, but more as and when I feel like it. However I always leave at minimum 3 days between sessions).

It wasn't a particularly ""good"" session. I felt a little brighter than baseline, but not much more than that. 

However by the end of the day when my kids came home from daycare I realized I had acres of headroom. I realized just how lean I've been running lately and how I've really just been oscillating between a really demanding job and parenting. 

It enabled some really lovely space to just hang with my kids and also enabled some nice reflections in the evening. It also highlighted how close I am to burnout right now.

THIS is why I MD. These lessons.

I'll be re-engaging a therapist asap to tackle the burnout. But I'm immensely grateful to have access to the resources to actually MD. That is all. 👍",18,885,2,163,0
2021-06-23 08:16:21,"Week 6 of MD – I feel like I've discovered the cheat code to life. I've felt improvements physically, mentally and spiritually.","I started MDing psilocybin in mid-May, having been depressed and lethargic for years. I'm doing the Fadiman protocol with 0.1g.

Just in these six weeks I've been taking it, this is what I've noticed:


-- My mood has perceptibly lifted – not just a bit, but I feel like a whole new person with emotional energy to do things. My flat is so much cleaner, I've ticked things off my to-do list that have been languishing for months, I've picked up new hobbies (more on that below).


-- As with a lot of people who have depression, I was really fixated on the past, romanticising it and wishing it was *x*-year again. I was holding onto all of these relics from past failed relationships which were important to my identity (gifts, photos love letters, text conversations, even IM conversations dating back to the aughts!). I knew they were weighing me down and stopping me from committing to someone new but couldn't bring myself to part with them. For some reason about two weeks ago, I felt ready to finally let go of my past, and I did a few burning ceremonies to get rid of all of it (just the past relationship stuff) along with some cord-cutting. I feel so much lighter. I realised yesterday, for the first time in longer than I can remember, I had no desire to be anywhere else but where I am now.


-- I'm so much less anxious and second-guessing of myself in social situations. I just shoot from the hip; there isn't that pause where I'm thinking, 'wait, should I say that?' or 'shit, why did I say that?'. I've been more present and other-focused in my job (I'm a yoga teacher for private groups and individuals and do all my classes online). I can talk to my friends and family without getting too intense and one-pointed on them. I have C-PTSD, so these breakthroughs for me. Words feel like they're flowing again.


-- This one really took me by surprise – I have a basketball court near me and decided I'd practice shooting hoops. I was the worst at sports in my classes at school. Literally, last to be picked, etc. For some reason, without any preparation, I'm dang good at it now. I get the ball in the net nearly every time, from different angles and distances. I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but life feels more 3D to me after I've ingested some psilocybin (trip dose or micro). And the skill just makes sense to me now. I also had bookmarked some YouTube dance tutorials over a year ago and couldn't get the movements down (for a yoga teacher, I'm not very coordinated). I tried one of the videos again last week and got it on my *first try*.


Anyway, thought I'd share!


Edit; one more I thought of:

-- I feel much more resilient to life's disappointments, rather than letting them spoil my day or getting pulled into catastrophic thinking. Parcels getting lost, emails being ignored, mistakes I make, etc. Anyone who's been following crypto will know the markets have been in freefall the past few weeks, and I've had £000s wiped off my portfolio (and I'm not a wealthy person). Last time this happened a few years ago, I was so down about it. This time I'm kind of shrugging my shoulders – but maybe that's just experience telling me it'll recover in time.",127,3194,22,579,0

I did lots of mundane tasks (laundry, housework groceries, play park) but I thoroughly enjoyed them and being with my kids. They actually brought me joy. I have one very challenging child and their behaviours didn't pull me into a spiral of frustration and shouting. I was more compassionate and in turn they were more calm. I have tried to get to this place so many times, and not be triggered by their meltdowns, but I have never got on top of it. Today i felt zero anxiety, just a nice pleasurable day with the kids.

However I began microdosing lsd a week ago, and I pretty much stopped weed altogether! The cool thing is that quitting isn't even a conscious effort I'm making, I literally just don't think about it at all. No urges, cravings, nothing.

2020-08-03 21:59:54,Feedback Please: Psilocybin Microdosing Guide,"Appreciate any feedback or critiques or additions you may have.

**Psilocybin Microdosing Guide**

1. ***What is microdosing?***

Microdosing refers to the practice of taking a miniscule amount of a psychedelic substance -- usually one-20th to one-tenth of a full dose. This guide will focus on microdosing with psilocybin mushrooms, but you may find parts of the text applicable to microdosing with other types of substances such as LSD, ketamine, iboga, mescaline, and cannabis.

Microdosing can help you get in touch with your Inner Healing Intelligence, which knows exactly what’s necessary for your health and happiness. The psychedelic substance can be a reliable and powerful ally to remind you of your innate capacity to heal yourself. Some people may refer to a microdose as a “spiritual vitamin.”

People microdose for a variety of reasons. Common intentions include spiritual growth, alleviating anxiety or depression, and entering flow states. Microdosing is most effective as part of a holistic, healthy lifestyle that prioritizes service, community, and truth.

2. ***What are the advantages of microdosing over macrodosing?***

Taking a full dose of psilocybin mushrooms or truffles may be an ideal option if you have proper integration support and can afford to take at least one or two days away from your normal routine. On the other hand, microdosing can be a gentle method to enhance your life without disruption to your daily activities.

There are several reasons why you may choose to microdose instead of macrodose. Compared to taking a full dose, microdosing:

* usually requires less integration support, as the effects are more subtle and less jarring;
* requires less intensive preparation (although you will find that incorporating various preparation and integration practices into your life is a vital part of the healing and growth process);
* allows you to metaphorically dip your toes in the water before making a full commitment to dive in;
* allows you to retain some control instead of having to let go completely
* gives you the ability to carry on your daily activities in a normal or even enhanced manner;
* causes no hallucinatory, visual effects;
* is more flexible as you can take a microdose anytime during the day. Some people like to take it first thing in the morning, while others like to take it in the afternoon or even right before they go to sleep (although some may find taking the last option may keep them up for longer than expected);
* allows you to adjust dosage more effortlessly on dosing day
* gives you the opportunity to more easily experiment with and track dosages from day to day and week to week.

3. ***What are the effects of microdosing?***

Technically, a microdose is sub-perceptual, which means the effects are unnoticeable. In reality, however, many people can and want to feel the impacts of a microdose. Some of the most commonly reported effects of microdosing are:

* Increased energy
* A sense of presence and groundedness
* Heightened sense of emotional, mental, and physical well-being
* Increased emotional and mental maturity
* Increased optimism
* A sense of openness, brightness, or lightness
* Heightened sensory perception
* Decreased anxiety, stress and/or depression
* Improvement in relationships and social behaviors
* Decreased negative self-talk
* Increased sense of empathy, compassion, and love
* A heightened sense of being in touch and in tune with the body
* A feeling of interconnectedness
* An expanded sense of self
* Increased creativity
* Decreased need for caffeine, alcohol, tobacco or other stimulants or depressants
* Decreased addictive or destructive tendencies
* Improved eating and sleeping habits
* More clarity and less mental fog
* Less intense headaches
* Improved memory and vocabulary

Janet Chang, a mental health advocate who tracked her results during a [one-year microdosing experiment](https://medium.com/better-humans/how-one-year-of-microdosing-helped-my-career-relationships-and-happiness-715dbccdfae4), remarks: “*Over the year I microdosed, I became a more empathetic, compassionate, and affectionate person. I began to live with more acceptance, gratitude, and presence of mind. My workaholic lifestyle turned into one of spontaneity, creativity, self-expression, and lightheartedness. I continued to live out my values, feeling even more connected than before.*”

One redditor writes: “*I’m on day 6 now of microdosing \~0.08 to 0.12g.*

*The difference is subtle yet profound.*

*Nothing in my life has changed, yet everything has. The empty void that sucks the life out of everything I do is still there, but somehow I can see how beautiful it is and it doesn’t impede what I do. I feel how that vacuum is actually part of my ability to connect deeply with others and the world, that it’s one side of the coin, and the other side is God. These are all things I ‘knew’ consciously through mindfulness but couldn’t feel in my being. Now it’s being embodied.*

*I am more present, I don’t overthink, I am in my body. I can simply be without worrying about everything. I feel inspired to do more with my life for the betterment of the world. I am interconnected.*

*All of this happens at such a subtle, unconscious level. So even though my day-to-day hasn’t changed, I feel like I am the person I’m meant to be, when the gunk is cleared away.*”

Another journeyer says: “*I've been MD for about 3 months and I have never felt better. I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and was prescribed lexapro but after reading about how hard it is to get off antidepressants I opted to try MD.*

*My energy levels are back to normal, I used to want to sleep all the time and never wanted to go out. I've been a lot more productive at work and home, I've even had enough energy to go back to the gym. It's such a mood booster too, I am always a bit chattier on the days I MD (I MD 0.2g about 2-3 days a week).*”

Many microdosers claim the practice allows them to more easily enter flow states and “be in the zone.” Mikhaly Csíkszentmihályi, the originator of the idea of flow, [describes it](https://www.wired.com/1996/09/czik/) as ""being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz). Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost."" Microdosing seems to be a perfect tool for some people who wish to experience a determined, focused mindset free from distractions and negative thoughts.

Microdosing may open you up to more cyclical, instead of linear, thinking. You may find yourself being more curious and less dogmatic. You may find yourself listening more and talking less. You may start to question your assumptions and all the things you thought you knew.

4. ***What is the ideal microdosing dosage?***

Everybody reacts differently to various doses; some people consider .3 grams (or more) of dried mushrooms a microdose, whereas others are more comfortable with a much smaller dose in the range of .05 - .08 grams. The species or strain of mushrooms you consume also affects dosage, as some are stronger than others. For example, the *azurescens* species or the penis envy strain of the *cubensis* species are noted for being much stronger than the average *cubensis* strain.

It may take a few trials to find your ideal dose. You may find it beneficial to maintain a journal or log during the first few weeks of your microdosing journey, so you can reflect on the tracked results and make adjustments as needed. When in doubt, it’s usually better to start small and work your way up.

During your exploration phase, it may be helpful to take your doses in a space where you feel completely comfortable, safe, and free. Until you have a clear understanding on how psilocybin affects you, it may be safer to prepare just as if you were taking a larger dose just in case the effects are stronger than you imagined. Although having an ideal setting is not as crucial for a microdose as for a full dose, you may find it beneficial to avoid certain uncontrolled situations that may make you feel vulnerable (work, social, public transportation, etc.) when you first start experimenting. Definitely do not drive or operate heavy machinery when you are microdosing.

5. ***How should I take a microdose?***

There are many ways to take a microdose. Everybody has a different preference. There are no rights and wrongs.

Most people like to grind dried mushrooms into a fine powder, and then either encapsulate the powder (with or without other healthy ingredients) or mix it into a smoothie or other liquid.

Some eat mushrooms raw, while others chew them dried. Tea, chocolates, gummies, and tinctures are other delivery methods.

*6.* ***Is there an ideal dosing protocol?***

There are various microdosing protocols and schedules. To find one that works best for you, be open to experimenting and listening to your body and intuition. There’s no need to rigidly follow a protocol just because it’s popular or promoted by someone famous.

Here are the most common ones:

* A “one day on, two days off” schedule is recommended by James Fadiman, the author of [*The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys*](https://www.psychedelicexplorersguide.com/). In this protocol, you take a dose on Day 1, skip a dose on Day 2 and Day 3, and then resume dosing on Day 4. The idea behind this schedule is that the positive effects of microdosing seem to last two days, and the days off allow any residual tolerance to subside. Although Fadiman may have designed this protocol specifically for microdosing LSD, many psilocybin microdosers also follow it.
* A “four days on, three days off” schedule is recommended by Paul Stamets, a distinguished mycologist, who previously suggested a “five days on, two days off” schedule. It may be worth noting that Stamets, now in his mid-60s, who has spent much of his adult life studying psilocybin, has just recently changed his recommended protocol. This should give you confidence to have a flexible approach and allow your own experimentation and results to guide you.
* Other proponents may suggest a “every other day” or an “on, off, on, off, on, off, off”  protocol, or a “go with the flow” or “as needed” philosophy.

Microdosing every day is not suggested. The off-days reduce the effects of tolerance that can build up over time, and give you the opportunity to practice working with and processing emotions without the direct aid of a substance. The idea is to become aware of the root causes of unhappiness and pain, and to live a wholesome lifestyle that avoids these causes, and not to become dependent on any substance. In fact, under certain conditions, you may decide to take an “off-week” or “off-month.”

Some people recommend “stacking” other ingredients with the psilocybin. Stamets suggests adding lion's mane and niacin to the microdose, as they are known to work well with the main ingredient. As [one fan](https://medium.com/@nicksun/the-paul-stametes-microdosing-stacking-protocol-qi-gong-combined-practise-experiment-f29d1f3ee0b3) says, “psilocybin mushrooms promotes neuroplasticity and new neural connections, lion’s mane promotes the creation of new nerve and brain cells and niacin drives these two medicines to the furthest reaches of the nervous system. Together they work synergistically to create a compound effect that enhances learning, cognition, neuroregeneration and many other things.”

The addition of niacin has its advocates and detractors. Advocates argue that the “flushing” characteristic of niacin provides a built-in control against over- or misuse and opens the blood vessels to allow the other ingredients to move through the body more quickly and fully. Detractors say the possibility of experiencing an uncomfortable “flush,” or feeling unsettled or unwell as a result of the niacin, outweighs the benefits.

To their microdoses, others may add:

* turmeric and black pepper; the black pepper increases the bioavailability of the turmeric, and the turmeric acts as an MAO inhibitor, which makes the mushrooms “stronger”;
* dried ginger root, to reduce potential of nausea;
* medicinal mushrooms such as chaga, cordyceps, and reishi;
* adaptogens such as ashwagandha, bacopa, longjack, griffonia seed;
* vitamins such as d3.

1. ***Can I simultaneously take antidepressants and microdose?***

This is a common and complex question, and there seems to be no definitive answers or formal studies conducted. To stay safe, please consult your doctor before starting any microdosing regimen, especially if you have a history of mental illness or medication use. [Here is an excellent article](https://www.synthesisretreat.com/psilocybin-and-ssri-snri-interactions) that gives an overview of psilocybin’s interaction with various medications.

Some people feel that microdosing helps to wean and/or stay off antidepressants. Some report that antidepressant medications dull or even nullify the effects of microdosing. If you do decide to microdose while on these medications, you will most likely need a higher dose to feel desired effects.

Some find that microdosing psilocybin is a healthier, more natural alternative to taking various pharmaceutical agents. Microdosing may be worth a try before committing to a pharmaceutical regimen.

Please note that microdosing does not guarantee happiness. Some people find it extremely difficult to come or stay off certain pharmaceutical medications. Those who have relied on these medications for years may find many painful or difficult repressed emotions coming to the surface, and may feel an urge to return to the numbing effects of the medications. The process of coming off these medications, if that is what you wish to do, may be an uncomfortable ordeal lasting several months.

*8.* ***Does diet affect my reaction to the mushrooms?***

Taking a microdose on an empty stomach will lead to faster metabolization and more intense effects. Taking a dose right after a heavy meal will slow down or weaken your body’s reaction as the mushroom competes with other substances to be digested and assimilated into the system. The emptier your stomach and healthier your diet, the less of a dose you will need to achieve the desired effects.

9. ***Are there any adverse effects of microdosing?***

When microdosing, some people may experience what they perceive to be adverse side effects. Psilocybin can act as a truth serum that reveals your innermost thoughts, and some of these thoughts may be painful or otherwise unpleasant to encounter. You may feel like running away, hiding or distracting yourself when these thoughts appear. You may feel the urge to blame the medicine for unwanted emotions, but one of microdosing’s major lessons is to take responsibility for your responses to what shows up. You can choose to resist reality or relinquish control and surrender. The latter choice leads to freedom and joy.

Some report that microdosing makes them feel tired or drowsy. Some complain of headaches or nausea. These are some of the body’s natural responses to energetic and emotional shifts.

For some, microdosing may amplify their anxiety, instead of decreasing it. The medicine makes you sensitive to your emotions and the energies around you. Psilocybin can shake up your sense of self, and make you feel vulnerable. Sometimes while microdosing, you may experience more fear, a natural response to the unknown. The more you face and overcome this fear, the more confident and grounded you will be. Fear is a natural part of expanding your comfort zone.

You may lose productivity and a certain type of linear focus while taking a microdose. The medicine seems to weaken the analytical part of the mind and activate the feeling part. This shift may affect one’s ability to focus on a screen, a conversation, words, or numbers. Microdosing may cause you to feel spaced out and confused for a period of time. You may feel like you are losing control. These experiences can give the thinking mind a rest and show you the causes of stress or anxiety.

Microdosing may change your idea of what medicine is and what the healing process looks and feels like. There are bound to be moments of unpleasantness as the “gunk” comes to the surface. The less spiritual or contemplative work one has done, the more difficult it may feel to face these unpleasant emotions.

It takes time to build a relationship with the medicine, which is alive and organic. Microdosing is not like taking certain pharmaceutical medications; instead of numbing emotions and allowing you to coast and ignore the root causes of your unhappiness, mushrooms require you to become aware of and actively change the causes of your states of mind.

Patience along with a commitment to long-term thinking, healthy living, and reevaluating relationships are necessary factors for the medicine to work its magic. Some people see desired results right away, whereas others start recognizing significant results only after reflecting upon several months of microdosing.

The higher your expectations, the more likely you will be disappointed in the results of microdosing. The medicine merely reflects your relationship with the world. If you expect something outside of yourself to bring you instant or eternal happiness, you will be disillusioned. This disillusionment is part of the spiritual path. Sometimes, one must learn repeatedly that all phenomena is temporary, no matter how pleasant or unpleasant. Holding onto ideas, philosophies, or desires that do not align with the truth only prolongs one’s never-ending search for something better and more pleasant and less painful. When you let go of expectations, the world opens up and becomes more wonder-ful.

*10.* ***What happens if I accidentally take too much?***

If you do accidentally take too much, it can help to move the body, eat something, get out into nature, or just lay down and rest until you feel ready to return to your normal routine. Remind yourself that the journey will end and the medicine is showing you whatever you need to see.

11. ***What about legality?***

The legal status of psilocybin remains a challenge for many. In most jurisdictions (with exceptions in the Netherlands, Jamaica, Brazil, and a few other places), the possession, cultivation and processing of psilocybin (as well as other psychedelics) are criminalized.

However, movements calling for the decriminalization of psilocybin and other substances are gaining steam. Denver has decriminalized psilocybin, while Oakland and Santa Cruz have decriminalized all entheogens. Oregon state and Washington D.C. have psychedelic initiatives appearing on the November ballot. Canada’s government has tolerated the sale of psilocybin mushrooms through the internet and in-person dispensaries, and there are widespread calls across the nation to decriminalize simple possession of controlled substances.

With the growing number of positive testimonials about microdosing, many are taking matters into their own hands and finding ways to access the medicine. If you do enough research and read documents like this (removed link, read: sourcing), you may discover a safe way to find mushrooms.

12. ***What if I want to take a higher dose?***

Microdosing is a gradual process of unraveling and loosening the tensions in the body and mind, while taking higher doses will bring emotions to the surface in a much more intense and accelerated fashion. Once you start seeing the benefits of microdosing, you may naturally want to explore taking a higher dose. You may even find yourself skipping the microdoses altogether and going straight to bigger doses. Again, there is no right and wrong way to approach the medicine.

There are many written guides online that help you prepare for a higher dose. [Here is one example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nAc2QGU6DB1AfqNtMdPfZ3JWXS7SuojGXz5M2bQ8ggY/edit?usp=sharing). It’s important to note that taking a higher dose will require more stringent preparation and integration protocols to ensure a safe and healing journey. Set and setting become increasingly important as the dosage becomes larger. You may want to consider a guide or companion to accompany you during your higher dose journey.

Psychedelic retreats are a wonderful opportunity to experience a cohesive, supportive group setting with passionate, skilled professionals (also referred to as guides, therapists, tripsitters, or spaceholders). Here are two links ([one](https://www.psychedelicexperience.net/organisation/tag/psilocybin-mushroom), [two](https://tripsitters.org/journey/)) that list psilocybin retreats and guides. While most retreats are focused on providing high-dose psychedelic journeys, there are organizations such as [Rise Wellness](https://risewellnessretreat.com/) that focus exclusively on the microdosing experiences.",45,21036,5,3316,0
2021-06-20 17:46:27,A happy father's day,"I have been making mushroom chocolate for about a year and finding great benefits in microdosing with it, and I offered to send my dad a small bar. He's in his late 70s and has had profound lifelong depression and crippling anxiety. I wasn't sure he would actually try it, but I called him today, about three weeks after I sent it, and he answered the phone with a brightness in his voice that I have frankly never heard before.

About midway through the conversation he mentioned he was almost out of chocolate, and I realized he'd been microdosing per my suggestion, and loving it! He reported feeling calmer, more centered, more able to take things in stride. He said he took a few days off during the worst of the heat but that he still felt very relaxed and optimistic--all words I've pretty much never heard him speak, ever.

He was also much more articulate and steady in his voice than he's been in the last ten years, not losing his train of thought and not sounding like he's speaking through a wad of cotton, if that makes sense. Sounded younger, sharper, stronger. I am absolutely thrilled and just had to share. You *can* teach an old dog new tricks. :-)",20,1167,4,212,0
2021-05-22 22:02:01,Today I was reborn again,"So I have been having severe mental health problems throughout my lifetime. I tried microdosing and it really helped me.

Then, I decided to go for a solo trip to the northern part of scotland on an island, the Isle of Skye! I was visiting one of the mountain, Quiraing, and I took more doses of mushroom than usual, about 1.5g, then things happened.

I was laying down, with the high rock mountain in front of me, the view was too beautiful for me to handle. I was listening to this peaceful ancient song, and I suddenly seeing a bright red light brighter than usual, it was the sun, but when i closed my eyes, it was a different red colour, it was very warm. When I opened my eyes, I see the grass, flowers, just dancing due to the wind, and everything became so vivid. I couldn't describe it. My body was tingling, and while laying down, i was moving my body following the rhythm of the flowers and grass, everything was so alive, it was as if I was part of them. 

I was thinking that I was so jealous of them because they are able to see this view everyday. I became so high that I realized that I was so still, still as a stone, and I felt like time move for a thousand years, just laying there as a stone. Then, I suddenly have a rush of compassion towards myself like never before. I have been so self-destructive, harming and beating myself everyday. 

I was fully conscious, so conscious that I was thinking as a soul, not as a human. I realized that my body and my soul are not one, and I chose to wear this body. I was very compassionate of what I have gone through. It was moment of perfection, almost a state of paradise.p I do not know how to describe it, it was a very familiar warmth feeling. 

To achieve this state of pure happiness, I realized that I had to be in a state of depravation, to lack of something, which means, to be a human. Only then, I can acknowledge and understand what this feeling of pure perfection, or enlightenment feels like. One cannot exist without the other. I was too in the moment, that I was laying still for an hour and a half. It was the best feeling of my life.

I discovered something about myself too. 

Edit: 

Thanks for the upvotes guys! Maybe I can add few more things. During the time, I was in a state of full comfort, scottish highlands are cold so I wore two layers of jacket, it was cold and it was warm as well. While listening to songs like Full Circle by Xavier Rudd, Anima Mundi by Entheogenic and Sudden Awakening by Blue Lunar Monkey (these songs really help). i wasnt full nor hungry, i was in a state of pure balance where every needs that I had were met, and it was a perfect moment to experience the pure happiness even just for a moment, that's why i said i was still as a rock, i was just there, be one with the nature, no needs.. like a rock, air, just existing and loving, one with nature, one with the universe ♥️

2021-01-08 02:36:04,My life is improving exponentially thanks in large part to microdosing,"For the last few years my marriage was failing and I developed a drinking problem and thought I would spend the rest of my life on antidepressants. I did a year off alcohol but started boozing last May due to job loss and covid stress. In August I decided to try microdosing to get off the ssris I had been on for nearly 10 years. I had tried and failed numerous times but couldnt wean off them in the past due to brain zaps. Microdosing worked a treat and within a few weeks I was off the zoloft. However in was back to boozing and with that came my hangovers and nasty personality which was causing problems. I was feeling something shifting however due to microdosing and in would call this self awareness. I started to analyze my behaviour over the years and were exactly things started to go wrong and look at emotions more clearly. I realized that I was moving through life largely unconsciously driven by the ego and not being accepting of people and life in general. I was also experiencing 10 years of supressed emotions come to the surface that were supressed by ssris and alcohol. I cried...a lot, and opened myself up to my wife about what was going on and how she and my kids were the most important thing to me. I have stopped drinking and have no desire for it. No desire to substitute with cannabis which I did when I stopped for a year. I use running to manage my stress and feel more hopeful and connected than I have in a long time. This stuff works. I think it could help a large portion of the population who struggle with anxiety depression and addictions. I feel hopeful that the stigmas around this magical plant are breaking down and the more we can let people know that this could help them, that it can potentially help them reconnect with themselves and then others. Because that's what this does. It helped me connect to myself...self awareness. And from there you can then figure out what you want and what's important to you. Ssris and alcohol do the opposite. They masked my pain and emotions and kept me disconnected. Psilocybin is a miracle compound that should be accessible to every responsible adult on the planet, and if it was then in thing this world could become a much much better place.",70,2229,11,408,0

I have no problem with people getting high but it seems off topic.

What do you guys think?

====================

Edit: to reply to most common comments, I'm not against talking about the effects of larger doses, that information is obviously valuable to newbies. I would suggest that is better limited to replies to posts not the subject. I feel a lot of posts are trying to work out the maximum amount they can take and still function. Healing involves consistent effort over long periods of time. As inconvenience as trauma is, dealing with it shouldn't be approached as any% speedrun.

Other common one (paraphrased): ""Please be apathetic about the content posted here, so I post off-topic here"" in subs that receive low amounts of upvotes, every post can be pushed to the first page, and that's not really fair to the users that want on-topic discussions. Maybe we have Macrodose Monday, Tripping Tuesday, or another sort of theme day or two a week where we can expect all the macro dosing content be posted. That way everyone who wants to post about macro dosing has a place to be welcome on the sub.

Towards the end of the three month period of microdosing, my negative thoughts got amplified and spiraled out of control.  I even started having suidical ideations which never occurred prior to microdosing.  I am bummed because I was optimistic that microdosing would help with my social anxiety.

2020-05-02 14:30:21,I've made a free app that helps you keep track of your microdoses!," TL;DR: I've made an app that allows you to easily track your microdoses and use of other drugs (alcohol, cannabis, and more). It's now available for free on iOS and Android. 

At the end of 2018, I started tracking every drug I have taken. Checking notes on my phone wasn't convenient, so in February I started working on Dose. It's an app that allows you to log any drug you've taken. You can then easily see your entries, as well as various stats regarding your use. I think it's perfect for microdoses - you can quickly see when your next dose should be, add notes with your thoughts to every entry, and check how long you've been microdosing (make sure to take breaks!). 

Today I want to share it with you all. The app is far from being fully finished and some bugs may still occur. I'm going to release new updates and fixes regularly. 

Here are the key features: 

* It is, and will always be free, unlimited 
* Available on iOS and Android 
* Works out-of-the-box with defaults based on TripSit/PsychonautWiki 
* See how often you consume, how much you spend and a lot of other meaningful stats 
* Track any substance you want 
* Visualize your usage on a calendar 
* Select your most common dosages to log them faster
* Attach a note to an entry 
* Secure your data with a PIN code 
* Your data is stored locally and can be exported anytime 
* Dark mode 

I'm going to publish new updates regularly. Goals, graphs, and various in-depth statistics are a priority now. 

You can get the app [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.doseapp.android), or [download it on iOS here](https://doseapp.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=microdosing). (make sure you open the site in Safari, not the Reddit browser)

2020-05-19 15:39:31,First time in my life this has happened,"So Ive been dealing with ADHD along with other mental issues. I have been wanting to try MD for a while but had trouble finding it even in LA. Finally a friend of a friend got me some but it's a badly distributed batch. Sometimes I would get too much energy others not so much. Yesterday was perfect however.

I have a lot of trouble reading, I never read a full book because my attention won't make it that far. Even a chapter is difficult as I can only catch the 10th word. I reread so much that I get tired and lose patience. Here's where yesterday changed everything. I got a new book and last night after working all day I opened the book. I read 40 pages straight, no daydreams, no lost of focused (even with my wife paying video games and a party next door on their balcony), and I also took notes. I brought out a post it package and would note pages that I thought were important. I wanted to read all night!

I couldn't believe it. I still can't. I'm so happy. I've never felt that before and I am still processing. What an incredible feeling to be able to overcome an issue that I've had all my life.",39,1111,8,215,0
2019-08-27 13:33:30,Why I stopped microdosing (anyone else?),"This sub is mostly posts with positive experiences or questions regarding MDing, and I was certainly one of those posters. There is nothing wrong with this, but I think it’s important for the community to hear the other side as well. This is just my story, and of course may be completely different to others’ experiences. As a side note, I have generalized/social anxieties as well as minor depression that comes and goes. 

For about 9 months I was MDing 6-12ug lsd. Dose days were the happiest, most confident, most focused, overall “best” days - by far. I was absolutely certain I’d be doing this for the rest of my life. Even considered trying to get off of antidepressants. 

Over time I started noticing a couple things. One is that these effects were less pronounced, even after breaks of a few weeks. 
The other, more important observation, is that I think I was making myself a little crazy, with the common theme being “our existence on this planet is so random and life is too short/precious for this bullshit (work, drama, etc).” I hated my job. I wanted to move myself and my family to a “better place.” I wanted more out of life, at the same time trying to maintain my work and family (wife/kids). I didn’t have time or mental strength for this. So I stopped microdosing several months ago. 

I decided to mildly trip (150ug) this past weekend for the first time in maybe a decade. It was one of the best times of my life, but then also reminded me why I perhaps shouldn’t trip or microdose: both are just too much fun. Real life is so different and so much more difficult. It’s too hard for me coming back from that utopian fantasy land. Anyone else? Thanks for reading.",40,1686,6,304,0

2021-04-04 13:28:22,My experience so far. Micro dosing while still on SNRI/Anti Depressants.,"I started dabbling in LSD a couple months ago. I was and continued to be in an extremely dark place.  LSD helped me to appreciate things outside myself but being on SNRI, I had very minor visuals as effects are reduced.

I had told my partner more than once to just find someone else. Someone less broken and I will end myself. My CPTSD was resulting in frequent flashbacks, I was taking sick days from work due to not being able to sleep. My partner wants a child which I had agreed to years ago but depression/cptsd resurfaced again while still on anti depressants. I couldn't bare the thought of bringing a child into this world. Therapy has never really been of help. Anti depressants rob me of almost all feeling with emotional range greatly reduced. I didn't want to be here. My partner didn't give up on me then, so how could I?

More recently, I was able to obtain shrooms. I started with a couple macro doses. First one was a bit similar to the LSD. Second one I had a bad trip, I felt very strongly the pent up emotions I had and I came to some important realizations.

Now I have started micro dosing shrooms. I can feel emotions, I can feel human again. I had a rough start micro dosing while I processed trauma and anxiety. I feel like what trauma I processed on my own thanks to micro dosing was more useful then months or years of therapy.

I feel alive again. I started working out again. I setup goals and pulled myself together. I feel like I want to be here and am not just going through the motions. I have been on antidepressants for 20 years. I have already started to reduce the dosage and will continue to. I hope to be anti depressant free by the end of the year. I will take it slow as I really want to be sure to get free of them without relapse.

The benefits I get from micro dosing:  Enhanced introspection, increased energy, reduced appetite, increased appreciation to nature, enhanced physical and mental performance.

&#x200B;

Side note: Came across this article today. I agree. Shrooms do the opposite of antidepressants. Shrooms help you to feel - anti depressants help numb you. Its pretty crazy how many people have been on Anti-depressants for 10+years and have no plans to stop. Its no way to live this life.

2021-04-09 14:31:10,Psilocybin makes me cry,"TL;DR microdosing made me a more empathetic ""happy-crier"" and macrodoses make me sob every time (and it's a good thing!)

Started microdosing psilocybin about three months now. I take about 0.15 grams about 4-5 days a week and macro roughly every two weeks. I started because of my struggles with childhood trauma and depression, and it's definitely been helping me process my emotions and learn from them, as well as have more energy, motivation, and creativity. But one of the biggest things is, psilocybin makes me cry... like, a lot. Every single time I macro, I end up ugly sobbing, either because of actual sad emotions OR good emotions (I almost always cry about how much I love my cat, for example). I also find myself having a ton of empathy. Basically any social media post that's supposed to be heartwarming or wholesome (i.e. cute kittens/puppies, r/humansbeingbros or r/MadeMeSmile) makes me tear up or full on cry now. If someone else is crying in the video, I am DEFINITELY also crying. It's kind of crazy, because I've never been much of a happy-crier at all. 

I saw someone post something here along the lines of, ""antidepressants make you numb, psilocybin makes you feel"" and that really resonates with me. I think I probably sob my eyes out every time I macrodose because it's shit I've been holding back for years finally coming out. Hopefully that will stop with time (you know, so I can actually take shrooms with other people lmao) but I thought I'd mention it, because it's a side effect that I never really expected.

2022-01-16 16:09:59,111 days of > 0.5g shrooms daily no breaks for depression,"Hi friends,

I've had a lot of shrooms/LSD over the last three and half months. Never missing a day and sometimes going up to 1 g a day. It's been the best and healthiest three months of my life. My IRL friends have all noticed how much I've changed as a person. I've come to share some of my knowledge.

The reason I started eating a lot of psychedelics is because I want to get from stage I to stage III, which I describe as follows:

stage I: anxiety, depression, addictions, numbness, ADHD, poor diet, sedentary

stage II: able to work, take care of my dog, exercise, get along with parents

stage III: desire to learn, explore, create, celebrate, play, reach out, and help others

Did I get there? I'm not sure but I'm definitely doing way better than I did in the last 30 years of my life. I know y'all have all sorts of reasons to stay with your dosage (fear of tolerance, feeling of dependence, fear of bad trips, etc) and I've been there too. But here's a little encouragement for those who are on the fence about increasing:

do you know what Depression's favourite catchphrase is? ""What's the point?"" – You will hear that in your head all the time. And the worst part is, it's going to say that about the very things that are supposed to help make you happier like shrooms or therapy or skincare or cooking a nice meal. It might say something like: yeah sure you might feel better but it's only temporary and in the end you're going to be back to being sad because you're a sad person so what's the point anyway? Don't listen to that voice in your head. Making an effort to be temporarily happier is what life is all about!

Having to eat a lot of shrooms to feel temporarily happier is no different than going for a jog to feel temporarily happier is no different than hanging out with friends to feel temporarily happier is no different than going on a vacation to feel temporarily happier. Maybe there is no permanent solution in life and that's okay. That just means we have to try that much harder. Be somebody who tries. Be a trier and nothing can stop you.

Edit: this post is my personal experience only. I do not wish to encourage the use of illicit drugs. Psychedelics are dangerous and could cause PTSD and long-term use could lead to dependence. Please practice harm reduction techniques.",57,2311,11,423,0

The very first time I took my MD, my usual pre-work thought of ""urgh, I really don't want to write today"" was followed by, ""Wait. *do* I want to write today?""

Even my desire to smoke weed had significantly depleted. I'll still smoke every once and a while if I'm about to make some dope art, or go to a good concert, but it's not a priority at all. 

Maybe I'm just getting old, but those old modalities aren't nurturing me. If I can just put more energy into mindfulness and meditation from now on I think I can create some real lasting changes for the better.

Now, I have been using THC and nicotine daily for the past 15 years, needless to say I am quite dependent. However, starting yesterday even a small amount of nicotine makes me feel incredibly ill, to the point I was wondering if I had to go to the ER. Using THC now makes my chest and stomach flutter with so much anxiety that I can’t sit still and feel like vomiting. I threw away my nic and my bong today and I’m not looking back.

The week prior to microdosing, I took 1.5g to test my tolerance and ended up going on a mild trip with some psychedelic visuals and spatial warping. During this trip I used both nicotine and and THC per usual, and I had a passing thought of “huh, these substances don’t do anything for me anymore except make me feel uncomfortable”. It was just a passing thought, and I didn’t change my habits going into the following weeks. However, every time I smoked I started feeling just a little more sick, a little more anxious, until now, I feel like I’m on the verge of a full-blown panic attack for hours from a small amount of these substances that had me by the balls for the past decade. I feel smarter, less anxious, better mood, better person without my addictions. The crazy part is there is absolutely no regret, or wanting, or cravings. Just the feeling of pure revulsion towards what I once thought was my “medication”. Could these substances that I’ve used to ease my anxiety been the root cause of my anxiety in the first place, and mushrooms just showed me the way? For me, it seems so.

I started saying that a friend of mine has been microdosing with shrooms and it’s helping him out a lot. She advised against it and said you can end with psychosis. She was so against it I just shut my mouth about my own psychedelic experiences. Kinda bummed me out.

2023-01-26 02:12:08,My life has changed because of microdosing.,"A success story:

I was dealing with low levels of depression, general and social anxiety, low energy, procrastination and disorganized due to my ADHD. 

I hated my job and was performing poorly. 
I wasn’t exercising or socializing with friends and family. I couldn’t keep my house clean or cook meals, instead was always eating take out. I am up to my eyeballs in debt because of impulsive spending on stupid shut. 

Enter microdosing. 

I’ve been microdosing regularly since September 2022. 

I have never been happier and more productive in my entire adult memory. I can honestly say that every complaint that I’ve listed about is no longer an issue. 

I am killing it at work, so organized and efficient, my house is clean, I can get excited about cooking AND do the dishes afterwards. I’ve been working out and losing pounds. 

Probably the most noticeable for me though is the improvement in my social anxiety. I hated talking to people, hated going out in public, I wasn’t even interested in talking to my family. I was lonely but scared to put myself out in the world at the same time. 

I have so much more confidence having conversations with people. I WANT to socialize again. I want to go to the store rather than getting things delivered, I’m more articulate and better at small talk. I didn’t realize how my social anxiety was impacting me until I started acting like my social young teenage self again. OH best part! I feel this way without alcohol! Shrooms have allowed me to drastically cut back in how much I drink. 

I am so thankful for this discovery in my life and I hope everyone can feel the same improvements, even if they’re only slight. 


Dosing regime: started with 100mg 4-5days on, 2 days off. Did that for 3 months. Now I take 350mg on Friday or Sunday and 50-100mg once half way through the week. The larger dose seems to work well for me! 

I want to hear how shrooms have helped you. I love reading these kind of stories ❤️

Edit: I should have clarified what I’m microdosing! I take psilocybin capsules which come in 50mg doses, and they’re also stacked with other functional mushrooms like lion’s mane and reishi.",43,2150,7,379,0
2020-04-22 00:58:53,1 gram of shrooms helped me realize that I have a caffeine addiction which negatively impacts my BPD symptoms,"I recently did 1 gram of shrooms and even though it was not such a dose that I would see any visuals, it was a very useful experience for me. 

I have been diagnosed with having borderline personality disorder traits, which then lead to depression and anxiety.

Caffeine definitely is not the cause of my BPD symptoms, but the recent shrooms experience helped me realize that I do have a caffeine addiction which negatively impacts my life. I think I have been denying it, saying to my self that - it's just caffeine, it's not like I do illegal stimulant drugs. Shrooms helped me accept that brain biochemistry doesn't care about the legal status of caffeine. I had to accept that even though being completely legal and sold everywhere, I do get mood crashes from caffeine as I would from cocaine (which I tried a long time ago in high school). I can have a few cups of tea in a day, but I do like to drink several in a row, I also like coffee and yerba mate. I have been observing my symptoms for a while and I do notice that I get dysphoric later on in the day if I have coffee or yerba mate in the morning, especially on an empty stomach. I also get more paranoid about being alone, not having any friends (even though I do have several good friends), etc. I knew this for a while, just shrooms helped me accept that I really should do something about the caffeine addiction as it really negatively impacts my mood and sense of self.  
I don't think I need to completely give up tea, but I did have to quit coffee and yerba mate, which actually did help me to have a more even mood throughout the day. I also have been taking CBD oil that I made at home, I think that also helps with anxiety and mood swings. I will still have a few cups of black tea, which I love, but I need to limit myself at only three-four cups of tea per day, not very strong.   
This realization might seem not very important, maybe some people expect some enlightenment or spiritual experiences from shrooms, but whenever I do shrooms I actually feel very logical and I am able to see myself from a side. I was able to analyze the correlation between my caffeine consumption and my BPD symptoms in a more unbiased way and this is actually an important realization for me, as BPD symptoms really worsen my quality of life, so if something like reducing caffeine can help - it's not a breakthrough for humanity, but a big improvement for me. And also hoping to help anyone else reading it affected by BPD - I do believe caffeine might worsen psychiatric symptoms for some individuals.",109,2560,19,476,0

2021-07-08 12:24:07,My negative narrator just disappeared from my head! Insane. Also- Advice needed on spacing the doses!,"Hi all!

First of all, thanks everyone for encouraging me to start on this journey. Classic story here- undiagnosed bipolar for decades, alcoholism and crippling anxiety.

I started microdosing 6 weeks ago and it’s been very slow at first for me. I experimented with a few larger doses (1.5g), I LOVED this and of course attempted to abuse it at first. I realised very quickly this is not what shrooms are about and, as a true self hating addict, I feel incredibly wise and strong for immediately deciding to cut it down and stick to a moderate schedule that works for me- 0.5g, three days on, 2 days off. I’ll add that in the first 2 weeks of experimenting, I had a few crying breakdowns that were cathartic and long bloody overdue. 

Kind of slowly and very subtly, I started noticing that the clarity about my life started to increase in resolution. I could now very clearly distinguish “mood tunnels” and ruminating thoughts from real, healthy emotions. I no longer obsess about certain situations (e.g. at work), I no longer have panic attacks but even better- I don’t *live in fear* of having a panic attack publicly at work anymore. My judgment and, by extension, my responses to life situations are a lot more measured and composed. 

I am very grateful that I’ve found something that works for me and I just started my own tub of shrooms  last week, hoping I will have the first flush in September! 🤞 in the meantime, I’ve been left with only 8g of shrooms and I wanted to ask for your help on how to space them out most efficiently? 

The first batch came from a compassionate colleague who knows my struggles and has offered to procure. I would rather not abuse their generosity by asking for more. 

Thanks so much in advance!!",101,1739,16,310,0

Uncle Bens precooked rice bags. I inoculate 6 at a time.

Micro Pore tape. Inoculate then tape over injection hole to allow gas exchange. (don't need to cut a corner off)

Wait a month for mycelium to grow and fill the bag.

Coco Coir and vermiculite (both very cheap at gardening stores). 1 brick coco, 1qt verm, 4qt boiling water(pasteurizes/sterilizes it), Let sit for 3 hours, mix a few times. Substrate done. Don't even worry about field capacity, just follow the numbers/amounts stated.

Monotub, drill 4 holes. Tape over holes with micro pore tape. Break up mycelium and layer it into your substrate into your tub. Get about 3-4 inches from the bottom. Let sit for a couple weeks (sometimes less). Mist and fan 2 twice a day.

2023-03-10 11:24:24,Gratitude doesn‘t get enough attention from this sub.,"I barely see people mentioning gratitude practices in this sub but i‘m convinced they‘re one of the most powerful tools to incorporate into your life in combination with microdosing.

When talking about gratitude practices most people seem to recommend to write about 3-5 things for which you‘re greatful each day but this doesn‘t change much.

Try writing about 100 things instead and ask yourself every time you write something down: why do i feel gratitude for this? 

As you go on with the list you‘ll find yourself struggling to find things you‘re greatful for and this is where it gets interesting. The first time i did this i tried to start my day with this practice, but after #20 it started to get hard and as someone with a rather pessimistic outlook on the world, writing about 100 things you‘re greatful for is absolutely brutal. I had to leave for work and i set the intention to be mindful about the day and finish the list when i get home. This immediately changed my perception of the world the minute i left my house as i was forced to see the good things in life.

""The wind which is blowing into my face actually feels fucking great"", ""The chirping of the birds sounds so joyful, i should appreciate that more""
I left my house 30 seconds ago and i already had more appreciation than the whole week before, the thoughts were forced but still, it changed the outlook on life. As i got home i sat down and tried to finish the list but there were still 20 things missing which made me start to look for the good in all of my problems and this is where i think the biggest change in yourself happens, if you can start to feel gratitude for the opportunities to learn from your mistakes, you can heal and you can grow.

I noticed a tremendous shift in my thinking since doing this daily for the last week and i think this is a very radical and effective approach to change your mind if you always see the bad in everything.",53,1936,8,357,0

2021-06-12 05:12:55,"After microdosing shrooms for 6 weeks: back pain reduced, exercising more, feeling more calm","Back in the 90s, I did full doses of shrooms with my buddies in college. Had some good experiences. Shrooms opened me up -- and I got more into spiritual practices after some of my shroom trips. Got into daily meditation and yoga, and pretty much kept going with those practices since the 90s.

After college I didn't take shrooms anymore due to life changes, focusing on my career, starting a family, and the like. Lately the microdosing trend caught my interest, and I decided to give it a try.

I just completed six weeks of microdosing shrooms -- taking them 2 or 3 times each week -- always with at least one day off in between each dose.

As a result of microdosing:

* back pain reduced a lot. Had mild to moderate chronic back pain the past 15 months due to  stress, working from home all the time at a crappy desk, and not having enough social interaction outside of my family. Now my back feels amazing. I think it's connected with the increased exercise I'm doing (see below), along with the positive ""brain changes"" associated with microdosing shrooms.
* I'm exercising a lot more (before microdosing I exercised about 2 days on a typical week; after microdosing I'm now in a habit of  exercising 4 days on a typical week)
* Feeling less craving for alcohol (I never drink to excess anymore, and have averaged at 2 drinks a day typically; but now after microdosing 6 weeks I'm often having just 1 drink a day)
* less stressed and more calm in general
* more warm and outgoing in social interactions

But microdosing is not all positive. It can be really challenging. I noticed some side effects of microdosing, including:

* on microdosing days I feel more avoidant of administrative/busywork tasks that I should be doing, but that I feel like putting off and procrastinating. This is not a new problem of mine; it seems like microdosing brings it up to the surface for me to look at that attitude. Puts it under the magnifying glass. Kind of annoying but also good for me to look at these procrastination habits.
* I feel more tired at the end of a microdosing day. Mentally fatigued. Not a terribly bad thing. I think it's showing me I have to manage my energy and do practices during the day to recharge, center myself, etc.
* Feel less focused and more irritable on the microdosing days. (like many of you, my favorite days lately are my ""afterglow"" days, right after the microdosing day. Feels so great!)

Going forward I plan to keep microdosing. I think the key to microdosing is to use it in conjunction with exercise, with meditation, and other things that promote health, strengthen your body and mind, etc. I recently discovered a wearable tech product called ""Hapbee"" that looks promising, as a way to reduce irritability and problems focusing. So I'm going to start using that next week.

For anyone considering microdosing, hope this helps.",92,2866,14,507,0

Respectfully. My question is, why do people view biblical spiritual experiences as something to be believed (talking animals, resurrections, etc.) But think that ACTUAL spiritual experiences are bad??? In other words, if I believe in the spiritual experiences of those in the Bible, then that's considered GOOD by my peers. But if I have MY OWN spiritual experiences, then that's considered BAD.

2021-05-13 12:01:21,I freaking LOVE mushrooms!,"I've been microdosing for nearly a year, and the only reason I could start was because I learned how to forage actives in my local area.  I found and dried enough last season to last me until now.  Two days ago I was down to my last 0.2g and had no idea how I was going to get more.  I moved states since I last foraged, and wasn't sure that they grew around here.  I've had the most stressful 6 months of my life and MDing has helped massively, so I was not thrilled about running out....

By pure chance, I was out the back of the property I live on searching for something else, when I thought to myself ""this looks like Sub country"", about 3 seconds later I looked down and saw  a mushroom - so naturally I looked for more (not fun as I'm currently injured and can't move around well) and found a big handful.  Then, after clomping around on other promising looking areas around the house - I ended up foraging 180g!! 

They popped their heads up just in the nick of time and right on my doorstep just after I had become almost completely incapacitated.  I love these guys!!  I feel such a connection with them, and I always seem to be led to where they are growing.  I'm so happy to have my medicine sorted for the next few months, and completely amazed to have moved to a property where they appear to grow prolifically (it's very early in the season and I wasn't expecting to see them yet).

If you  live in an area that has actives and haven't yet considered foraging, I highly recommend investing the time to learn about it and give it a go.  It adds such an incredible joy and depth to MD practice.",26,1608,4,306,0

We have openly talked about marijuana before, and I know he’s that type of guy, so his response immediately prompted my question, “That’s one way, but have you done DMT?”. He looked at me with a “yes of course” face, and then nodded (probably didn’t want the receptionist to hear).

With his acceptance of DMT, I asked him what his thoughts were on microdosing, and told him I had been microdosing to help with multiple problems in my life, including the breaking of my nicotine addiction (done). He revealed to me that he has been microdosing for years, with shrooms though, as he can acquire them easily. 

He is a firm believer that a psychedelic renaissance is coming, and coming fast. He told me that it would not surprise him if our favorite substances were prescribed to people within the next 5-7 years.

Upon further investigation it turns out this video is FULL of misinformation. The worst part is he is a real doctor with almost 2 million subscribers. 

Lets break this down.

The video is actually 2 separate cases fictitiously combined to appear as one. This is not mentioned AT ALL in the video, only in the description.

Case 1 is of a man buying cyanide from the deep web to commit suicide. He bought it intentionally. He did not buy shrooms.

Case 2 is of a man injecting mushroom tea. There was no cyanide involved. He also fails to mention that the man in case 2 is an opioid addict with unmedicated bipolar disorder which would explain why he injected it.

As if this wasn’t bad enough he also defines microdosing as “maintaining a baseline trip”.

This guy has a doctorate in pharmacology. An actual Doctor/pharmacist.
To me this whole video just seems like he wants people to think drugs on the deep web are laced with cyanide.

2021-01-15 00:36:31,Oops! I accidentally lemon tekked myself this morning.,"I microdose Tuesday Thursday and Saturday. My usual morning routine is, 1.) wake up around 3:30, shower, eat 0.25 of shroom around 4:00, do yoga til 5:20, feeling great need to leave the house at 5:30 so I get dressed, and I take some vitamins and a healthy drink I make with spirulina, maca powder, and this stuff called camu camu powder. Camu camu is some kind of tropical fruit. A teaspoon of it has like 700% of your vitamin c. I really do notice a difference taking this stuff and getting my nutrition from real foods. The camu camu helps with energy, alertness, and staying positive. 

I slept in today and changed the routine a little bit. 

I decided I wanted tea and meditation instead of yoga. So I had my shower, did just a little yoga, some sun salutations and a couple Asanas, said my little prayers for the day and then ate my 0.25 of Shroom. It was about 5am. I still wanted my tea session so I got dressed really quickly, went to the kitchen (still chewing up my shroom cuz I like to chew it up really well and get the juices flowing) and I had my healthy drink to wash the shroom down with my vitamins. As I said before the healthy drink has the camu camu powder like 700 percent vitamin c. So then I sat down and had a fantastic 20 minute tea and meditation session. I drank like 5 cups of high vibe, hot oolong tea and I think this also added some potential to this whole experience. If anything maybe just cuz the hot beverage was in my system just after swallowing the shroom (and the healthy drink with camu camu powder) so it may have made like a mushroom tea of sorts. 

So I realize with all this meditation and yoga and healthy eating and such, it’s true that I’m sensitive to things. On a normal microdose day, My 0.25 hits me just the way I want it to, but it’s certainly noticeable. I always say when people talk about shrooms that they actually hit me as soon as I’m done eating them. I literally start to feel shifts by the time I’ve swallowed no matter what the dose. Although extremely subtle, that’s when the experience starts for me. So if you ask me “how long til it kicks in?” I’ll say “the experience has already begun...” lol.

Anyway, I’m meditating with the tea and already noticing it’s going to be a little stronger today... okay no worries I’m sure I’ll just be extra happy and making jokes. 

So I grab a fresh baked crossiant (gotta eat something  for these vibes ya know?) and rush out the door like every morning. I’m on my drive feeling good but stimulated. I then started to feel a little nauseous. Again I knew what I was in for. I just knew it was going to hit me harder than usual. So I’m thinking “okay yeah.. nausea. That happens when you eat mushrooms. I only ate 0.25 I’m sure I’ll be fine... but usually nausea means I’m going to TRIP. Lol... Okay your fine calm down.” 

So I had some hard dark techno on. Still feeling extra good and energized although a little nauseous. Enjoying the drive. People are rushing rushing rushing to work. I’m pretty contemplative about the vibe on the roads but still just another day to me. I’m
Just much more aware of the grind and pressure right now on these roads. Nausea passes and all of a sudden I’m emotional and nervous. I feel stimulated and my vision has changed. And I have a lot of extra introspection which I can’t stop from happening and making it difficult to get into “work mode” it’s just hanging there interfering and making me nervous for the day lol... 

So I got to work. Shut the car off. Sat in it for an extra 1 minute and closed my eyes. Took a deep breath. And then got out of the car and got straight to work. 

I’m in construction by the way. I did the usual checkins and hellos with awkwardness and some avoidance. I work In a major city. We meet in a lot where we park our trucks and store equipment and there’s a small office. So I get right to work so I can avoid people. Loading things, starting trucks, opening boxes and getting ready for the day etc. I’m moving super fast for a dark cold January morning but it’s nothing out of the ordinary I’m always moving and working hard so people are used to me not being very social... I’m usually conscious about being more social and friendly on my micro dose days... but not today lol. So far so good. 

So I had a few interactions which were awkward and confusing. People reminding me things and trying to tell me what to get or what’s next. I had to listen closely and then repeat what they said back to them for clarity. I definitely felt lost a few times in the morning scramble with figuring out my life at work while also literally figuring out my life in my self and personality and figuring out how to get my tasks organized at the same time. Wondering if
I belong here. Forgetting street names and street numbers and confusing this for that and this section of the city for that section.... it was all the same to me in this moment and none of it mattered. At times there was a rush of people doing some task and I just felt like a lost kid at the grocery store. Just floating around unattached. Consciously realizing how attached I typically was to the work and trying to not be attached right now cuz being attached to this work was just too Much for me to handle in this moment. 

I was hyper aware of the personality I had constructed  for the construction work lol. Since I was very much in my spiritual and emotional self, it was difficult for me to snap into my regular construction guy routine. I felt like an awkward teenager at the cool kids party and anytime we were just standing and catching up with each other just talking like any normal day, I felt really introspective and contemplative about these work relationships and how the masculine construction vibe has affected my personality over the years. Am I really this guy??? Who am I? Why am I doing this? Why do I work so hard? I’m so intense... really analyzing my stress in the business. Needless to say, I just tried to keep busy. 

Physical tasks were amazing but I was really having trouble communicating. I just typed that sentence reading it out loud is a wake up call for me. Like this experience is just how I am regularly on any normal day but obviously amplified right now cuz the shrooms. So I’m going to repeat that sentence for my own clarity to gain insight for self improvement.  PHYSICAL TASKS WERE AMAZING BUT I WAS REALLY HAVING TROUBLE COMMUNICATING. My life’s struggle lol. I felt like an awkward teenager. I just felt out of place so I kept quiet. “These people probably think I’m weird everyday anyway don’t they?? Man I’m so weird.” Anytime I wasn’t busy I just felt a little too loose, a little too relaxed, a little comfortable, while also at the same time a little too uncomfortable, a little out of place, and honestly a little too attractive and interesting and I felt like everyone was looking at me. The way I handled equipment and tools was just way too high key and intelligent with so much focus and energy from my eyes and I consciously had to dumb myself down at times and work a little slower lol. I tried not to look around too much because if I stared at the gravel and dirt on the ground it was too beautiful and same thing if I stared at the trees or focused too much on the engine of a truck that was running or a light that was shining, etc. 

Anyway, I knew that the hour at the yard getting ready was going to be the hardest part and that soon I would be on my way to the job site which was a 20
Minute drive. I was really looking forward to that drive, alone, in the warm truck as my salvation. So we finished up said the very awkward “okay are we good to go? Are we leaving? Okay got everything? Okay here’s the plan. Okay see ya there.” Eventually (longest hour of my life) the time came and I had a nice calm, happy drive where I was able to remind myself that I really, really need to relax. Which is what I’m learning to do through all of my microdosing experiences and in any effort at self improvement that I have right now.... just fucking relax dude! 

So these 20 minutes of contemplation on my drive really worked and by the time I got to the job site around 7:30 I felt good. Still stimulated and getting over the awkwardness I experienced earlier but okay and had lots to focus on and less people around. Just my usual guys who get to see all my moods on a daily basis lol. 

Hands down the funniest thing that happened through all of this was when I first got there, I went to the office to sign my sign in sheets, get truck keys and say my hellos to the boss and secretary and whatever foreman are in there hanging out... so I’m just feeling everything all nervous and took that 1 minute in my car to take a breath and get my mind together. I take that extra long walk to the office to sign my papers and get my keys and say my hellos. Trying to make it as quick and low key as possibly. I open the door and this Forman in there whose always making the dirty jokes and messing around with everyone and making people laugh and generally being loud and talking too
much says to me “there he is we were just talking about you and all your crazy dance moves!! I like to dance now and again even in my older years.. I know you’ve been to some raves in your day huh?” Other boss says “oh yeah he’s definitely been to some raves he’s been to all kinds of crazy stuff..” first guy says “yeah I’ve seen his crazy dance videos on IG all those psychedelic dance moves.. he likes all the weird stuff and moving all funny!”

I cannot believe he actually said the word psychedelic and held his hands out all dance like and started joking at me for being a little freaky and messing with me for my “psychedelic dance videos” Like the word psychedelic was one of the first words I heard come out of anyone’s mouth on this day and no one ever brings stuff like this up at work. Like yeah they know I dance and I’m artsy and all that and they get my vibe and might assume things about me but they never bring it up and I really don’t wear that vibe at work ever. It was just too much lol. 

Omg I literally could not believe that I just walked into this office and this is what I had to listen to and respond to in this state at 6 in the morning... I just awkwardly smiled and said “yeahhhhh hahaha” 

It was mad weird lol. 

And the trip lasted way shorter than usual. By the time 8am rolled around I was feeling normal construction worker and ready for a coffee. Totally sinking even more comfortably than usual into my construction guy vibe. I usually feel the microdose vibes until 11 on a normal day and then feel great. Today it hit me all at once.  

So anyway I was thinking about it and I finally realized later that day that because I slept in and changed my routine, I lemon tekked myself. I usually take the smoothie with the camu camu powder an hour after I take the shroom. When I’m done yoga already over the come up. This time I basically washed the shroom down with the smoothie and then meditated with a bunch of hot tea... 

So to me, I would say that the 0.25 of shroom literally felt like 1.5 grams. I was really feeling it lol.

Don’t make the mistake I made lol! Thanks for reading my long crazy story.

EDIT: Thank you for the support, laughs, and appreciation for my story guys! I had to get this on paper just for my own sanity to process what I went through yesterday. I was hoping someone would read it but I wasn’t expecting such a great response. Sharing this has been a really positive experience for me.

TL;DR 
I accidentally Lemon Tekked my microdose and it hit me all at once and made me feel extremely awkward and introspective when I went to work that day and at the time it wasn’t funny but I have a great story about it now and I can look back on it and laugh.",54,11791,8,2240,0
2021-04-02 05:55:34,Had a funny thing happen to me the other day. I forgot that I MD'd...,"I was getting ready for a camping trip, so in a big rush and trying not to forget anything while I packed up the truck, kinda stressed because I woke up late. So I was packing up my kitchen stuff and saw the scale and thought, ""wth, might as well take a MD."" I'm not really on a schedule, I MD every once in a while, macro every other weekend or so. So I took .15 grams and totally forgot about it since I was so busy rushing around.

So, finally all packed and I get going and stop at a coffee shop for the drive. I go in and they are playing this super-funky music and I straight up felt like dancing -- just boogeying down right there. I was waiting around for my coffee and noticed a painting on the wall by a local artist and was just floored by the beauty! I'm thinking, ""what is going on, why am I so happy? This is not normal."" Lol. Thats when I remembered the microdose and had to laugh at myself.

2020-09-25 05:05:04,Try micro microdosing - seriously.,"I read a lot of people recommending 5-15ug for a microdose, and I’m sure that’s great for many people. Maybe some slight visuals, energy, euphoria etc. 

Lately I’ve found that I can get all the same benefits from a dose as small as 1-2ug. I’ve been dosing like this for about six months, and I’ve noticed that it is much more sub-perceptual and less distracting when I’m seriously trying to work. 

On a bigger dose it’s easier for it to be at the forefront of your consciousness, like ‘wow this microdose is really making my work less boring’, but on a couple of ug I find it’s easier to forget about the microdose altogether and just go about my day. 

The best bit is sitting down at the end of the day and reflecting on why the day was so much fun, and then remembering that you were on acid the whole day. I find it’s harder to forget about on bigger doses. 

Anyway, just wanted to share this with you all. Don’t be afraid to give a smaller dose a shot. No matter how tiny 1ug seems, never forget that lsd is incredibly powerful. Take care.",34,1047,5,197,0
2019-05-11 20:50:22,A perspective on long term microdosing,"So to set this up a bit, I come from a community of in depth psychedelic researchers. I have been taught by some of the paradigmatic figures in the psychedelic revolution since the synthesis of LSD. I spent a period of years microdosing LSD at varying doses interspersed with high dose LSD sessions.

&#x200B;

I think Hoffman or Grof, I forget who, were right when they said microdosing LSD could have become the adderall of its day had there been more sensitivity to its therapeutic benefits.

&#x200B;

Microdosing LSD, and LSD in general, help support--in my view--some degree of abstraction from the physical body that supports consciousness. I would say that the opposite is true with mushrooms, which to some extent involve becoming more deeply enmeshed with the body. I want to affirm this is just my view, and to me helps to explain that ""similar but different"" feeling between LSD and mushrooms. 

&#x200B;

This abstraction is a wonderful gift because it allows one's sense of self to overcome the ""dragginess"" of the body that usually gets in the way of one's telos. So, if there is something you want to do, often it is the body and our nutrition and exercise habits that create a physiological deficit that makes it difficult to get motivated or to concentrate. Its like, the body is feeling lazy and needy so because it is perhaps not being conditioned to an optimal level and so the shift in abstraction from microdosing helps one feel more present and able to concentrate.

&#x200B;

There is also the benefit of being more ""in the moment"" and in a sense every moment feels extremely fresh and unencumbered by the baggage of the past. At the same time, becoming highly sensitive in this way can also make it so that if you have a negative experience, one can wallow more deeply in that experience that would otherwise be the case. I have heard LSD and psychedelics be described as ""non specific amplifiers""... so they can amplify that feeling of being in control and focused and sharp, but also that feeling of being a bit lost and embarrassed etc.

&#x200B;

So how does this impact long term microdosing? What has this experience been like for me? I am definitely a better version of myself when microdosing than when not in many significant regards. I follow Ralph Metzner's  schedule of a microdose every 4th day (dose today, break tomorrow, break day after, dose on day 4). I find day 1 and day 2 are still in the dose, while day 3 is a bit outside of it and so a chance to reset.  I have also found the optimal dose for me is 10 micrograms. 5 micrograms is interesting but a bit light (though to be honest I have not experimented much with this amount), whereas 20 micrograms starts to become a bit more into the zone... so its great for a trip to the museum, but not ideal for every day stuff. To administer the dose, I had a vial of lsd, would put a drop into a small chemistry cylinder which I had divided into 10 parts with a sharpie, and used distilled water (from CVS) to prevent to breakdown of the LSD (alcohol or distilled water... tap water can contaminate). Of course this container would be kept away in a dark place, and I would use a long dropper to pull out the exact dose. LSD when mixed into the water (make sure you shake up the bottle!) is remarkably consistent from dose to dose.

&#x200B;

So I would say I became a better version of myself because it was much easier to overcome negative habits. As I said the dragginess of the body is reduced. I have an addictive history, so it would help support me ""being in the moment"" and not succumb to the gnawing pressure of the last donut I ate or whatever it may have been. I would be able to have pretty intense workouts, and all of that is conserved in the body. My entire life in a subtle way just became much better designed... I was more rational and clinical in how I designed my time and my work etc. I think there are many people who can speak to what is so great about microdosing, and I honestly recommend everybody in the world should likely have access to it.

&#x200B;

Also, given the somewhat ""mystical properties"" of psychedelics, I would also be able to tune into groups and collective fields that otherwise is not possible. I can not understate the profound nature of the psychedelic experience which is present even in the microdose psychologically speaking. 

&#x200B;

Break down of benefits

\- Clarity, energy, focus, drive

\- Creating one's own reality without shackled to the past

\- Quick bounce back from down days... I knew every 3 days I would have access to a psychological reset, so nothing brought me down too far

\- Mystical experiences of psychedelics are still present in subtle hard to describe ways in the microdose. Walls aren't melting, but one still has access to collective states that would otherwise occur through meditation

\- More insular from negative states of others around. I was in a bit of a toxic home environment, so really helped me create my own space

\- intellectual development would occur faster. because I am so in my own space, so my art work, my research, everything was more refined more quickly

&#x200B;

Here are some of the critiques of microdosing in this long term way...

\- my life did start to become a bit of a ""3 day chapter""... where the dosing schedule in a way defined my energy. So on dose day I would have a lot of energy and confidence, day 2 would feel like the opposite (because mind needs to recover) so I would be pretty tired and things would be harder than usual. Day 3 would be back to normal. And then dose the next day again feeling hyper competent. I'm not saying this is everybody's experience, but it did become mine if I am honest about it. That being said, I would still be able to push and go farther and harder than I otherwise would have. So there was still a 20 or 30% net gain despite the slow down on day 2.

\- I did become so present moment in a way that was suboptimal, because part of being an adult in the world requires having a refined sense of judgement. So I was a bit too youthful at times. You know like I would be so in the moment I may act in a way that looked out of character for somebody like myself. So maybe a bit erratic. Part of being a person with a lot of responsibilities is to carry many people's needs and subtle requirements in a moment, in conversation, with deftness. And I was generally a bit more roughshod.

\- I became a bit insular. Meaning because I felt erratic around others, and so deep in my psychological state, it became easier to focus internally rather than externally. this can be a great thing, but for where I am in my life now, I require a high degree of social calibration. Meeting with partners, investors, women, etc. And so I was a bit too anchored internally rather than externally. Not too well calibrated. Could potentially spook people. Hard to have subtle conversations because my psychology feels so loud. That abstraction of the body also made me feel a bit removed from people and experiences around me

\- making things happen in the world requires not just being good at them, but also creating one's place within society. and I find this ability to connect to the others around me to suffer under the long term microdosing

\- if I had a negative experience of shame, it would burn more deeply as well... which took a bit of a toll at times

\- sometimes hard to snap out of zones that are not serving me... maybe thinking about something over and over

&#x200B;

For these reasons, after nearly 2 years of almost non stop microdosing, I am now considering a shift in how I use this. Good to know it will always be there, but ideal for me at this stage is to support that clean bright consciousness through nutrition, yoga, meditation, nofap. I will likely use 20 ug microdoses for trips to museums occasionally. Maybe 10 ug microdose sometimes if I have a day of fun and exploration, creating art etc... But ideally not for my day in and day out going to work, being around others, meeting new people, picking up women, etc. I just don't trust myself in some sense to have the nuance to execute those high pressure situations under a microdose (whether the energy of day 1 or the sagginess of day 2). Rather than making it a part of my life as it was, I am making it something I occassionaly may add to my life.

&#x200B;

The mind is such that it needs to reset. Microdosing is a powerful stimulant, and when combined with sound principles, holitistic lifestyle, clear goals and passions, it is one of the most ""good"" things that humans have access to. At the same time, it made me so present moment and self referencing that creating truly deep relationships with new people was a bit lacking. Also, because I had this unusual amount of energy, there is some degree of social callibration that gets missed out. But the internal focus, and bringing one's internal life into the world is second to none. 

&#x200B;

Now I have a pretty addictive history, and I will always be glad to know that microdosing is this kind of soft bumper to help me reorient in case I run into a bit of trouble. However, I think just like it is good to have a savings account but not touch it, I think what I am called to do now is to recreate and relive that state which microdosing showed me and not accept any compromises from myself. To try and carry that energy and drive and present moment awareness and focus and clarity in my day to day, in a more socially callibrated way, with an eye towards the context of the past, and being less swayed by powerful positive or negative states in the moment... so a bit more mature and stable.

&#x200B;

I hope this account will be helpful to anybody considering or experimenting with microdosing, especially in a long term capacity. I hope I have conveyed both the positives and negatives, just as an honest account of what I experienced. I believe everybody should have access to microdosing. And everybody should try long term microdosing. And if one also finds that now the good qualities of microdosing may be holding one back from the new chapter which microdosing has opened up, I hope there can also be understanding and acceptance for that reality.

&#x200B;

It could even be that I return to a regular long term microdosing schedule in the future... I wouldn't be surprised. 

&#x200B;

The microdose is truly just as powerful and profound as the high dose trip in my view. Especially as there is an integration of more of the world into the trip (being out and about).

2021-01-24 21:54:43,I’ve never been this happy!,"Hi all

I’ve been microdosing 0.1 for about 2 months ish. The first 2-3 weeks I didn’t feel much of a difference. In fact I felt more sensitive to my negative emotions and wasn’t sure MD would help me. But I stuck in and wow I’m so happy I did!

I suffered from anxiety and depression on/off the past five years and nothing seemed to helped. I tried everything and been visiting several therapists though now I stick with one I’m happy with. 

Anyways the shrooms has completely rewired my brain or something. I’m waking up happy, grateful to be alive and going to bed giggling. I’m sleeping better, eating much healthier and I even have the energy to work out every two days. I’m sure all of this is also why I feel so good now. 

I still have days where I feel sad but it’s mostly over within short time and I’m all good. I seem to be able to cope better with overwhelming feelings now. I have a much bigger acceptance of my feelings and thoughts and they don’t stick around for long. 

Honestly I don’t know if it’s the shrooms or just placebo but it’s working! I plan taking a break soon so my system can reset and see how that goes. 

However I must empathize I have to put in the work as well. Observing my own patterns, breaking them and becoming a new person. You can’t just take psilocybin and expect all your shit to disappear. It won’t! But it might make it more clear to you why you have these problems and most importantly: it gives you the energy and strength to find out what to do with it and heal. It’s a long process and before this I worked a lot on my self but I felt like I wasn’t there 100% yet. No one is really, but at least I feel happy and at peace most of the time and that was my goal.

Edit: forgot to include I microdose every 3-4 days. I even forgot to take one a few days ago because i had a great day lol.

Edit 2: I want to include the work I have done before getting this far. I’m sure if I haven’t done all the work I did, I wouldn’t be this happy no matter how much I MD.

1) Getting therapy. The most important one!
2) Keeping a healthy sleep pattern.
3) Being physically active every day. I either go long walks, work out or do yoga.
4) eat healthy! I eat a vegan diet with lots of vegetables and fruits. Gives me much more energy throughout the day. I cut out sugar except a on a few occasions.
5) I learned my brain to be grateful everyday even for small things. I started writing a grateful journal every night and now it’s automatically 
6) Changed the way I view obstacles in life. Now I welcome them and thank them because they make me smarter and better. It took a while to get there, but now I view them as gifts instead of things that are holding me down 
7) I learned to love myself! Removed all negative self talk and only speak lovingly to myself 
8) I only do activities and plan my life around things I want to do. No more forcing myself out when I don’t want to. I live a quiet, happy life.
9) Meditation has been a big savor for me. It helped me observe my thoughts and emotions and made me change my reaction to them. I’ve become more accepting and inviting everything in and I let it go.
10) I gave up old friends that didn’t resonate with me and worked hard meeting new people more aligned with me and my values. Probably one of the most important ones here.
11) repetition, repetition, repetition. It’s a lifestyle change if you want to get better. It’s hard as hell first! There is no easy way to this. But soon it will become habit and you will realize you changed as well.

This took me years! 
I believe the microdosing really combined all of this together and gave me the last key I needed in order to produce more serotonin or whatever in my brain. Because two months ago I did this and I was still not that happy (but more though!) but that changed after MD.",27,3824,5,740,0

2020-08-27 23:56:27,Engineer microdoses LSD - Month 1,"It's been a month since I started microdosing LSD and here are my thoughts, observations and experiences about it.

&#x200B;

**About me**

A foreigner living in the Midwest, late 20s, works in the tech industry. Heard that half of Silicon Valley takes LSD and shrooms on a daily basis to help them with work, so I decided to try it as well. I also tripped a couple times before.Before microdosing I was meditating for about a month and I kept doing it through the month. Not sure it matters, but I saw quite a few posts about meditation here, so just throwing it out there.

&#x200B;

**How big was the dose?**

The first dose I took was 5ug, after that it was usually between 8-10ug, because honestly I was just excited to feel the effects more intensely.

&#x200B;

**How often did I microdose?**

No more than 3 times a week - Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Sometimes only twice a week, because I wasn't home on Monday or Friday.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

Overall I have a very positive experience with microdosing. If I had to summarize it with one phrase it would be ""life, but more intense"".

Everything is the same, I am still the same person, but I just feel better about myself, about my life goals, my relationships, my work and pretty much every other aspect. It helps me stay focused and more driven. I feel closer to my friends and family.

Having said that I actually enjoy the off days more than the on days. I know it sounds funny, but microdosing really made me realize I enjoy feeling calm and relaxed and microdose kind makes more feel like I drank a strong coffee - and I don't like strong coffee.

&#x200B;

Here are my more details observations, experiences and thoughts:

**Observations**

* **Overall emotions**  
I feel more in tune with my emotions. I feel love towards my close ones more intensely. It's also easier for me to understand and process what I feel.
* **Annoyance**  
I noticed sometimes I get more annoyed than usual. Nothing big, I'm just less polite when something gets on my nerve. Maybe that's just a side effect of being more in tune with my emotions?
* **Love**  
I just feel more love towards the close ones. Like before it was just one of the feelings I experienced and now I feel it more intensely.
* **Anxiety**  
I have been feeling anxious about my work ethic for a long time, but I was just pushing this feeling away for months (years maybe), which was made impossible when on a microdose. I felt quite a bit of anxiety the first week and it was because I finally saw the truth about how I work. LSD helped me realize that I procrastinate a lot and that I work maybe 4 hours, and that's an optimistic estimation. I still managed to get my shit done, however I realized how bad this actually is for my career...
* **Work**  
...that's why made necessary changes to focus more on work. I realized that this path of procrastination and slacking will harm me in the long run. I was very comfortable where I was, a bit too comfortable, and because of that I didn't do as much as I could. So I decided it's about damn time to push myself. I started focusing more on the tasks at hand (more of that later), which also made me more passionate about the work. I put at least 8 hours of work a day and if I'm out of tasks I educate myself about how I can do my work better. I'm more satisfied with my work and take more pride in it. There were times where I thought that maybe I had chosen a wrong career, but more and more I realize that it's all because I was procrastinating, which then made me cynical. Remove slacking and the cynicism will go away too, leaving pride and satisfaction.
* **Focus**  
I forget about the whole world and the only thing that exists is the thing I focus on. I don't check Facebook or Reddit during work anymore. It has it's obvious positive effects, but there's also the negative - I often get too caught up in my thoughts during meetings and it's hard for me to pay attention. I also started forgetting about small things, like during lunch I'll take out a new plate, even though I already had one but just forgot.
* **Social life**  
I became more empathetic towards my friends and family. It's easier for me to listen to people and to relate to them. I'm more playful, funnier and more relaxed when talking to people.
* **Tiredness**  
I feel more tired than usual at the end of a microdosing day. If I don't get enough sleep the next day, I feel terribly tired and sleepy.

&#x200B;

**Other**

A couple things happened during this month that can, but not necessarily have to be linked to microdosing:

* **Exercise**  
I completed a 30 day yoga challenge that I started before microdosing. I also started working out again at the gym. I don't know if microdosing helped me commit or not though, because I have been physically active before, I just had a break because of COVID-19.
* **Diet**  
I decided I want to limit the junk food and sweets I eat. This past year I couldn't go a week without chips or a chocolate bar, but now I'm doing just fine. I'm making my own meals, working out helps with that too. However I'm not willing to say that microdose helps me sticking to that decision yet.
* **Writing**  
I started writing, something I always wanted to do, but never thought I could.
* **Adoring nature**  
I had a chance to spend a weekend by a lake where the night sky was crystal clear and full of stars. I could stare at it and be amazed all night. However this past year I have put more focus on cherishing the moment and admiring nature in general, so I don't know if LSD helped me here.

&#x200B;

**Plans for month 2**

* **Take \~5ug**  
I think even though I like this little energy boost and focus that 10ug gives me, I feel more tired at the end of the day and it becomes slightly unpleasant. I want to see if 5ug can keep it the good effects while reducing the negative ones.

2019-03-10 05:59:04,My Double Blind Placebo Controlled LSD Micro Dose Experiment - With Charts,"I've heard great things about micro dosing, but I've always wondered how much of the effect is just placebo and how much is the actual benefit of the drug. There are plenty of subjective reports from users, but very few with actual data. I believe that knowing you are micro dosing has a 'self fulfilling prophecy' of sorts that tends to give you the benefits and effects that you expecting to get, so I started an experiment to try to control for this as best as possible.

I also wanted to see what affects different dose strengths have.

# The Setup

I created three different LSD solutions using volumetric dosing with distilled water.

The first solution was 100% water - simply the placebo.

The other solutions were created at 4ug\* and 8ug\* per dose. (See caveat below)

I labeled these three solutions and then had a friend transfer each solution to a labeled vial. He wrote down which solution went into each vial on a note card and sealed in in an envelope. This was all done out of sight of myself, so I would be unaware if I was consuming the solution with 8ug, 4ug or the placebo.

&#x200B;

The experiment ran for 4 months. In the first month, I didn't micro dose at all and simply logged my data to establish a baseline to compare to.

In each of the following three months, I micro dosed using a different vial every month. I followed the schedule of micro dosing followed by two rest days before micro dosing again. Every night, I logged how my day went, my mood, productivity and various emotions. There were a little over 60 questions every night.

&#x200B;

# The Experimenter

I'm male, mid 30's, married, with children. I have limited experience with psychedelics - I have never taken a full dose of LSD before, nor psilocybin. I have tried DMT twice, several months ago, but did not use that for the duration of the experiment just in case it could skew the data. I first tried cannabis when I was 30, and I consume that about 45 times a year (I also track that data too, but that's a whole other post)

The benefits of micro dosing I was hoping to find were increased productivity, focus and creativity at work. 

# The Results

As mentioned above, the first month (November) was just to establish a baseline and I was not micro dosing.

The second month (December) was the first time I started taking a micro dose every 3rd day. To be honest, I mentally believed that I was taking the 4ug solution. As I later found out, this was actually the placebo month.

The third month, (January) I started on a new vial and almost immediately knew something was different. My wife also mentioned that she saw a difference too. I suspected that this was the 8ug solution, and I was correct.

The fourth month was the final vial. This turned out to be the 4ug solution, but I was taking it under the assumption that it was actually the placebo. My wife still mentioned that I was in a better mood, but I still thought it was just placebo.

&#x200B;

The results of the experiment can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/Gy5XgYv). 

&#x200B;

I was very pleased with how the experiment went, even though the effects I experienced were not what I expected. 

I was mainly micro dosing in order to see improvements at work. However, the biggest improvements were actually to my overall mood and family life. 

Before I started the experiment, I was a bit depressed. This was somewhat alleviated the first month, which is interesting because that was actually the placebo month. Still, the depression got even better once I was actually micro dosing. I do believe now that micro dosing LSD has antidepressant abilities and this has been what's had the biggest impact on my life.

I also found that I was just in a generally better mood when micro dosing. I was more patient with my kids, enjoyed being around them more and just happier with my life in general. 

The changes at work were not what I expected. I found it a bit harder to focus on tasks, and while I was a bit more motivated to dig into work, this improvement was the same for the placebo. I also still left just as much work undone as during the baseline, but ironically, I was happier with the overall job I was doing, although I apparently wasn't really doing a better job. My mood at work did improve too, so although I didn't see major benefits at work, the few downsides were easily offset by an overall happiness. 

The day after micro dosing on 8ug I definitely felt more spaced out. I was more distractable and found myself daydreaming more. By the next day this seemed to go away.

&#x200B;

# The Takeaway

I certainly see the benefits of micro dosing and have found few downsides to it. I preferred the 8ug\* dose to the 4ug\* and think that is the sweet spot. I have since tried a 16ug dose one day, and while I was in a terrific mood, the lack of focus the next day wasn't worth it.

I'll probably continue to micro dose with the 8ug. Since the biggest improvement I found was when I was with my family, I'll probably take it every Saturday since I have off with them. I may take it once during the week too, just to hopefully continue with the general mood increase and anti-depressant qualities. 

&#x200B;

# The Caveat*

The 4ug and 8ug doses are assuming the tabs I have are 100ug each. It's very possible, even probable, that my tabs contained more or less than 100ug. Since I was using volumetric dosing, I'm confident that the amount I consumed each day was consistent, but the exact amount is unknown.

Protocol: 5 on 2 off

Substances:  Liberty Caps stacked with lions mane

Dosage: .08 - .12

A little background about me. Before microdosing I had essentially burnt out from a combination of work changes, stresses and social life issues. A heavy Saturday night on a cocktail of narcotics ended in a horrific panic attack with paramedics being called. That was the start of my downward spiral, thinking I'd done some permanent brain damage I became more and more anxious, stuck ruminating about everything and not really having a clue about what I was feeling or why I was feeling like that. I was borderline agoraphobic, depressive, paranoid and fucking scared. Coupled with that I was also a new dad, which definitely added to the stress of it all!.

I'd tried a few things to try and get my self back to baseline, meditation, acupuncture, CBD, cbt, magnesium, l-theanine... the list goes on. Some helped but only really marginally. Not wanting to go on antidepressants I decided to try micro-dosing psychedelics.

Mushrooms are an amazing substance, they really do have the power to change you as a person and help you release built-up/trapped emotions. That said you need to be willing to change and you need to be prepared to do a lot of the work yourself.

For me, I've had to make a number of life changes:

\- I meditate daily, for those wanting to get started check out headspace

\- Switched jobs

\- I've distanced myself from some friends and friendship groups after realising the importance of having friends that care and respect you.

\- Every morning I wake up and jump in a cold shower... look into Wim Hof if you're interested in the benefits

\- I've taken up reading again, a book that's really helped me is The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle

\- I wake up every morning and mentally list 3 things I'm grateful for.

\- Every morning I walk my dog and focus on being present

\- I've ditched all forms of social media, its a waste of time and ironically disconnects you from the world and the moment.

\- I've turned off ALL push notifications on my phone

\- Ditched my mding journal as I was constantly analysing myself rather than focusing on being in the now

\- Stopped wanting - more money, promotion, a bigger house, new car etc etc

\- I listen more. 

I'm also extremely lucky to have a loving wife that was able to support and guide me along the way. She's stuck with me through thick and thin which I'm eternally grateful for.

Anyway. I had 3 interviews recently for similar positions, got rejected. So this was the 4th one. At this point I was pretty discouraged and did not think I was gonna get the job anyway. So fuck it. I took a microdose if lsd, 4 hours before, to see if it would change things.

My tabs are very potent (or I’m just extreme lightweight too) and I probably took 1/12 maybe less.

The interview went fucking NICE.

I walked out of there like holy shit I just killed that. If they don’t hire me for that, then this place is not for me! Lol.

They asked me questions like what does success mean to you?

I fucking LOVED that question. I got so in depth/ detail and just pretty much gave them a whole lecture on what success is. And they were like damn. I could see it on their face. Lol. I can’t remember exactly how I worded it all, but I remember thinking - did that really just come out of my mouth? Even if I don’t get this job, I just learned the meaning of success. I’m stoked.

I was answering the questions ACTUALLY thinking about them. Not thinking what “a good answer is” and I would just answer them.

They asked me what I was proud of. I was like... not work related, but I quit smoking! After that I felt like I could do anything. So yeah I’m very proud of that! They were like damn (there were 2 interviewers in the room), and one said her parents still smoke and can’t quit. And I was like yeah I don’t blame them it is REALLY HARD TO DO!!


Anyway. The lsd just gave me a boost in confidence, gave me energy, made me really get deep into the questions (even enjoy them), and made me witty and ANIMATED

2020-09-14 05:14:55,First Macro after Several Months of Microdosing,"I know this sub is about microdosing. I hope it’s ok to post about a macro here. 

So the microdosing has been super helpful. It has allowed me to mostly get off Xanax for cPTSD which has been a huge relief. I still need it occasionally. I am recovering from psychological abuse and childhood trauma. It’s work in progress. A microdose for me is 30-50 mg. My self confidence is improved and I’m feeling more safe in social settings. 

I’ve been working up to the idea of doing a macro so I tested 100, 200 and 300 mg over the past few months and had good success meaning the experiences were nothing but positive. 

Tonight I took it up to 500 mg and had the most amazing experience. I did it in the dark with my eyes closed. It was very visual. I set my intentions to work through traumatic episodes in my life. 

So these traumas came up one by one. It allowed me to experience the trauma as if I was there back in time. The feelings of fear and anxiety ramped up and then the plant medicine deconstructed the traumatic event visually by fragmenting it then dissolving it or by exploding it into nothingness and in other ways like making the event or person look silly and non threatening in some way. 

This was super helpful in my healing.

I started a post in 2019 when I was saved from cptsd, depression, a brain injury, OCD, suicidal ideation, oh all that good stuff.

It just fixed me. I stopped Microdosing after 5.5 months because I was just stupidly happy and had been symptom free for so long I didn’t even remember what it felt like to be symptomatic.

Fast forward the pandemic and late May/early June I needed some help to learn pandemic coping skills. Got it. Now used to no ability to control my life I again stopped after about a month, maybe 2.

Here is where is gets interesting.

About a month ago I wanted to help not thinking about a loss I had experienced months earlier. I had grieved it but my brain seemed to be holding on. My plan microdose, but instead I didn’t, I just knew what I needed to do and somehow without the microdoses I was still able to consciously choose to rewire my subconscious focus. One week in and I had accomplished the change and it stuck.

Fluke maybe?

But here is the thing. Last week I decided I wanted to work on my life long procrastinating issue. My plan was micridose starting Saturday. Only again I didn’t feel compelled to actually take the microdose. Instead I am just not procrastinating anymore.

I’m 5 days in and getting everything done! Wtf?!

So I’m curious if anyone else has experienced that their time Microdosing not only helped rewire the things they intended to rewire but also some how taught their brain to not even need to microdoses to make the changes they want.

2020-05-31 05:39:06,Microdosing has replaced my SSRI and changed my life,"Hi everyone. I have lived with depression and anxiety for pretty much my entire life as a result of being bullied when in high school. I'm 44. It was only after a panic attack at work about two years ago that, with the help of my loving wife, I sought help and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I started some therapy, and my doc put me on an SSRI (Trintellix) and I started using a bit of cannabis. These all helped - I felt like I had hope for the future, where previously I was just living day to day with a knot in my stomach and tightness in my chest and throat. Both substances had their side effects - the cannabis kept me in a fog and it was hard to be motivated for work (I was in software, now marketing) and the SSRI worked by numbing my sadness and depression. Unfortunately it also numbed my happiness and other emotions. I was sleeping better and moving through the world with less anxiety, but didn't feel like I was really engaged in who I was.

I decided to try microdosing psilocybin since I'd had success microdosing cannabis to help with work focus, and I'd read it could help alleviate anxiety and depression. I had also read that combining SSRIs and psilocybin could be a bad combo, so I stopped my SSRI for 3 weeks. That was a very tough time. The knot in my stomach and tightness in my chest came back, and I always felt sad or angry. The day I took my first dose of 150mg I still felt sad and anxious. However the next two days saw a huge improvement and the anxiety and sadness and the associated physical feelings went away. It's been a month now and they haven't been back since. I also started regular psychotherapy not long before starting microdosing, and I do believe they both complement each other in my healing. I feel so much stronger and confident in myself now, even when times get hard or I am in a situation where I know I'll feel sad or angry. I am more in control and I don't feel numb anymore. I enjoy my personal relationships so much more, I actually am making closer connections with the few friends I have, I'm making new friends, and I'm working on my relationship with my parents, who I've never really been close to until now. It's really incredible how much my perspective on life has changed over just the past month. If you are considering microdosing to help with your anxiety and depression, do it.

Then I did some digging. For those of you who don't know, stoned ape theory in simplistic terms is basically that apes became exponentially more intelligent after consuming psychedelics, and this is how humans came to be. This and a long process of evolution of course. And I find that the more I go into the effects of psilocybin on the brain (I haven't done much digging for lsd and other psychs), the more I question the likelihood that this theory has legitimate substance to it. Psilocybin is known to increase resting state functional connectivity across the brain, as well as neural responses to conflicting emotional information in decision making circuits, and also has been known to improve top-down control of emotional processes. And as we all probably know, microdosing has also been shown to increase productivity, improve your ability to absorb information. I still think there's a lot of holes in the stoned ape theory, but I also believe we have only begun to scratch the surface as far as beneficial effects of microdosing goes.

I take .2 grams with 2 days in between doses. Each month I’ve taken 1 week off at the end of the month. This is what I’ve noticed...

1. My relationship with my girlfriend is so much better. She has had some serious trauma in her childhood and at times it can come out in ways that are difficult to handle. MDing has really been so helpful with me being able to hold space during her moments and be a supportive and loving force while she works through them. It’s helped me really understand her more and I’ve been able to not take her moments personally and can therefore bring a very compassionate energy to help her. Our relationship has improved so much and being that support to her has helped her with her own strength and self worth, knowing that someone is there who loves her unconditionally and supports her even at her low moments.

2. My job is much easier. My job is quite stressful, lots of moving and lifting and rushing. MD has helped me breathe and take my time and not get stressed out. It hasn’t effected my efficiency, instead it’s helped if anything bc when I’m stressed I tend to mess things up. Feeling so calm has helped me just glide through the days. I’ve been much more open and friendly to my boss. Before I was pretty closed off to him and always nervous around him. But we’ve been friendly lately and it helps the energy of the workplace a lot. I’ve found myself becoming the person who calms everyone else down when they are stressed. I’m able to really understand and feel their stress, but not take it on myself. I simply am able to validate their stress and provide some good motivating talk to help them through the days. It’s great to be that person.

3. My relationships with friends have been better. I’m often anxious and at times I will bail on plans bc I’m afraid of not being my best self and the anxiety can make me retreat into my comfort zone. But with MDing, it’s all good. I feel calm and grounded and confident with the energy I bring. Nobody is perfect all the time, so by being easier and more gentle with myself I can be that way with my friends as well. It seems my friends have been more open to me lately about emotional things, which is great bc guys don’t tend to share that kind of stuff. I think it’s healthy to do so, and I’m glad to be there in that way for them.

4. My art has been much better. I’ve been more experimental. I’m not so caught up in ideas of perfection. I simply have fun and I just let the art create itself. I’m simply doing this to express myself, and I find it so freeing to let go of expectations and ideas of making something “perfect”. 

5. My skateboarding has improved soooooo much. I’ve skated my entire life. But I hit a point in my skateboarding path where I stopped improving. I would constantly be learning and forgetting and relearning the same tricks over and over and over. I hadn’t improved in probably 5 years. I kind of stopped having fun with it. But since MDing, I am totally present. My board becomes an extension of my body. I don’t think about my tricks, I simply feel them. I am so in tune with the present moment and it’s as if my perception of skateboarding has completely changed. I’ve learned new tricks, I’ve found a whole new style. It’s been so great and fun.

6. Meditation and spiritual connection. I’ve always felt a spiritual connection within my life. However, my practices have always been pretty weak. I’ve found meditation to be much easier and I don’t feel like I’m forcing it. It just comes and I’m able to sink into that space much easier. I feel the plants around me. They speak to me somewhat. There are 2 trees in particular who I’ve become friends with. There’s a giant Siberian elm near me and I sit underneath it and it grounds me and I feel it sending me strength. There’s another willow tree nearby that I touched one day and I felt a surge of energy from it. I spend time underneath that one as well and I swear it has spoken to me. It’s helped me during times when I’ve been confused about my path, and it’s given me clarity. It’s amazing. I am so much more nurturing to my houseplants as well.

7. I can read my cats mind. I think my cat knows when I’ve dosed. She is extra friendly and curious around me on my MD days, and I’m so much more concerned with strengthening my relationship with it. She is so mysterious and she is so drawn to my mushrooms. Every chance she gets, she goes into my closet and curls up near my jars. It’s interesting. I’ve grown so much appreciation for her cuddles and I’ve really grown to learn her personality on such a deeper level. I love my cat :)

Anyways those are just some things that I’ve noticed during this experimentation. MDing has been so great for my spirit. Thank you all for reading this, I hope you’ve enjoyed. Have a beautiful day my awesome people! ❤️",36,4974,4,933,0
2020-10-13 18:45:06,Was going to be interviewed on a major primetime TV show about microdosing but then it got axed for the most frustrating reason,"Last night I was approached by one of the producers of the show The Doctors on CBS. He had seen one of my YouTube videos where I talk about my microdosing journey. 

They were doing a segment on psilocybin mushrooms and wanted to know if I'd be open to being interviewed about it. 

Of course I was excited by the opportunity and excited to talk about something that's been so transformative for me on a much bigger platform. 

The interview date was set for this Sunday (via Zoom). The producer just had one more question. ""Was I being medically supervised?"" 

I wrote back and said I couldn't be, because psilocybin mushrooms are a controlled substance. However, I was following the protocol of James Fadiman, who is the leading expert on microdosing. 

The producer wrote back and said that legally-speaking, they could not interview anyone who was ""receiving a medical treatment"" without ""medical supervision."" 

Can you believe that? It's like they recognize the medicinal benefits of such a practice... but can't talk about it because the substance we are dealing with is a Schedule 1 substance (something that is addictive \[not true\] and has no therapeutic benefit \[also not true\]). 

What a bummer.

2020-07-23 20:40:58,"My 2 cents, cut everything else off if you’re micro dosing.","In my short period of micro dosing, I’ve come to realize that taking any other stimulants, depressants or what not will set you back in the process. 
So far I’ve cut off Modafinil, coffee, occasional cigarettes and occasional drinks. 
Sometimes when I don’t have much to do, I reward myself with a hit of weed. But I don’t let that to become a  habit. 
MDing has also helped me with fasting. I’m back to OMAD(one meal a day) and it significantly boosts my mood and energy throughout the day. 
I understand that everyone’s different. That’s just my perspective so far. 
Thank you. 


***update: As some folks also mentioned in the comments, I feel obligated to mention that I’m not suggesting to stop taking prescription meds at all! That’s something you can only consult with your doctor. By depressants I mean substances like alcohol. Another important thing is this was my own personal experience and this might not be the case for others. If you’re taking supplements that are helping you in life, you should probably stick with them until you personally feel ready to stop. For example, I don’t like drinking coffee anymore because the crash I experience from stimulants really ruins my mood. This was a sacrifice that I used to make because I really needed coffee to kick start my day. Thanks to MDing, I don’t need that anymore so of course I’m gonna take advantage and end my caffeine dependency. I only do OMAD periodically. It’s probably not something you wanna do constantly. I always make sure that the one meal that I have is high in protein and very well balanced in terms of nutritions. When I’m not doing OMAD, I do intermittent fasting with very small windows to eat. Eating makes me very sluggish and unmotivated so I try to eat only later in the day and try to drink sufficient but not excessive amount of water during the day.",59,1845,11,325,0
2023-01-26 14:04:42,Microdosing cured my porn addiction,"I had been addicted to porn for about 17 years, from ages 11-28. I've tried and failed to quit porn through force of will, being more active, replacing the addiction, etc but I never made it more than a week or two and that was with extreme exertions of will.

In December I bought 0.1g shroom microdose pills after having tried normal recreational doses of shrooms and acid a few times. After taking it every 3 days for a few weeks I tried jerking off without watching porn, and I quickly noticed that the previously unbreakable habit of boredom/loneliness -> PMO was shattered. I now masturbate every day or two but I haven't watched porn to jerk off for 45 days, and this requires next to no exertion of will. 

A few times while scrolling I have seen things I found sexy which used to trigger PMO but now it has a most resulted in a quick look and the tab being closed. I cannot overstate how happy I am to be free of this addiction. I can already feel the negative effects of porn receding, I think more positively about women and I am more attracted to the ones around me. My fantasies are healthier. I have been putting more effort into and finding more success at getting dates. Overall I just feel like there is a load off my shoulders.

2022-07-20 14:04:56,A Wild “Macrodose” From A Microdoser.,"Hello everyone

So yesterday I was dealing with extreme depression. I am getting married very soon, (just nervous but excited) i recently had to quit my job due to an abusive boss, and my family has went through some extreme trauma losing my 22 year old sister to a drunk driver on his 4th dui. That being said- yesterday was hard. I struggle with suicidal ideation from fibromyalgia and needed to feel okay.

So i have been microdosing .1 - .25 on a 5 on 2 off schedule for a month or two and it is very helpful. Based on how bad i was feeling yesterday I decided to tell my fiance I needed to bigger dose to confront my problems. Now I tell you that I ate one single .8 Penis Envy cap, and I have had multiple experiences eating 3.5-7g of extremely strong mushrooms but this was so different.

Now I wish I had done some Lemontek due to getting alot of bad symptoms at first such as bad stomach upset, bit of anxiety flutters and feeling like i wanted to go back because i wasnt ready, but I told myself I was fine and with my soulmate and it would be okay. We decided to watch Fantastic Fungi by Paul Stamet and I cannot express the journey I went on.all of the sudden my legs begin to shake as if the g-force of the earth was sending me on my journey. I began to feel connection to earth and spirit that I havent felt in years, seeing visuals of connecting the earth and my soul as one. I felt an overall peace that everything is okay. That we have time and that eachother is all we need. Having amazing visuals on the screen from Paul the entire room was full of color and breathe. I have NO idea why this cap was so strong but I mentioned it to my fiance multiple times on how i was having extreme experience. I felt at peace on why my suicide was an issue and how to move forward. I talked everything out about what I was seeing and wil never forget that night. At one point of Fantastic Fungi, Paul was walking into the forest of fairytale green and it began to become a oil painting with Pauls face just melting. It has been years since feeling this way for me. I feel at peace about my sisters death knowing she is okay. This medicine is beyond helpful in the right settings. Just be ready to confront what you are hiding from.

This was the 3rd time in my experiences that I have had nothing short of a spiritual experience, and I am not Christian whatsoever. I personally believe that shrooms make me feel interconnected with my sou and grounded to what life is all about.

If you read this thanks so much 🙂

2020-12-27 13:54:50,Observations after years of the shroom.,"     I love psylocibin cubensis. I love growing it, love sharing it, love taking it. It has had some pretty dramatic results in my life from casual use. No schedule, calculated doses but not always a micro. I thought I would offer my observations iv collected over the years. 
     The best way to consume for me is shared with friends around a fire, 1 to 2 grams. Micro does little for me and doing it alone does even less.
      The number one reveal is that nothing is worth my health. I get sun every day and on overcast days I do D3. This has had more of an impact than shrooms. B Complex is also up there. Sleep has improved, aches and pains have improved, my energy is 100 percent all the time and I crash at night like a baby. 
      I hardly ever drink anymore, it is just boring and painful. Headaches and bloat, the buzz is not amazing either. Usually just a toast at a wedding or a friend hands me one. I usually cannot finish a full drink and feel no shame in pouring it down the sink.
     I dont smoke tobacco anymore for similar reasons to alcohol, putting it down was not super difficult. Still share a cigar with friends like once a month or two. 
     Pot is still in, but I take breaks about a week a month.  Love me some pot.

2022-10-19 17:27:32,Interactions with doctors and microdosing,"So, I've been pretty open with my GP about what I'm doing and he's fully supportive. 

I went to a surgical consultation yesterday and when they were asking medical history, they asked why I'm not taking my depression and bipolar medicines anymore. I said 'I found something that works better for me.' I'm super reluctant to talk about it with medical professionals because of the current legal status, but after some prodding I finally said I microdose mushrooms, and after more prodding admitted to microdosing LSD and recreational use of all of them plus DMT. The nurse was super inquisitive, which was kinda cool. She was super supportive about it and said I'm not along. As she was leaving she kinda whispered in my ear 'mushrooms are cheaper than pharmaceuticals'. 

The surgeon also asked about it and was non-judgemental and said it's showing a lot of promise. As I was leaving, they said continue doing what I'm doing and the surgery anesthesia shouldn't interact with it at all. 

So, kind of cool interaction, but still nervous about it being on my medical record. Anyone ever have issues with that?",41,1110,5,189,0
2021-08-26 12:16:59,I microdosed for my wedding,"I have strong social anxiety, I was dreading my own wedding for months, sometimes feeling suicidal. The days coming up to the wedding I'd feel ill and almost throw up.

I decided to microdose lsd, I had no shrooms. The last time I microdosed was a funeral, a very different event but similar in that it's a formal social gathering, and I remember that it helped me emotionally and socially.

On my wedding day I took the microdose between 8-9am. I couldn't eat but as time went on and the microdose kicked in I felt less nervous and my stomach hurt less from the hunger. I still only ate after thr ceremony, but I was consciously feeling better by the hour leading up to the ceremony at 2:30pm, then the reception went on until almost 11pm. The microdose stopped the worried voice in my head and I was able to talk without thinking. Everything was free flowing. I still didn't like to dance much or speak much with everyone there but I was very glad that I microdosed. I didn't notice much stimulation, I didn't notice any changes in colours or textures as I did before, but I was quite busy at the time.

Everything went well, not perfect, but good, luckily I wasn't stressed about imperfections and nothing stayed in my mind all day to worry about or beat myself up about.

The only way it could have been better is if I took it earlier and was able to eat before the ceremony, of if I had shrooms instead. (maybe)

I know most people like dancing and socialising but I have aspergers which mostly means I'm just like everyone else but don't really get or enjoy socialising that much, at least not in large groups like this. You can think of me as very shy, even though it's not actually shyness.",27,1698,5,313,0

I wanted to bring this to the community's attention. There is a patent troll who has filed three applications to trademark the term ""microdose"" which, if granted, could pose legal liability to anyone who sells products (think: stickers, accessories, t-shirts, etc) that fall under the cultural zeitgeist of our community.

This was just published yesterday in the US patent's trademark gazette which means the community has 30 days to file an opposition, otherwise it will be granted:

I am calling all business owners who produce any sort of physical good involving mushrooms or the word microdose to take note. The USPTO's examining attorney got this completely wrong. If granted, this person could sue anyone for creating and selling anything artistic with the word microdose on it.

Opposition letters can be filed here:

Please DM me if you run a business in the space and anticipate ever using the word microdose in any of your business activities. We can work together to make sure that patent trolls do not trick the government into granting intellectual property that could limit the ability of anyone to produce art related to microdosing.

2021-06-19 10:46:27,I microdose every day for ADHD and I'm doing great,"Let me start by saying that I used to be in some deep depression and anxiety for a couple years. I used to think that I was just lazy and forgetful even if I had thoughts about improving myself in so many ways.   
There was always this internal fight between my left shoulder angel ""Let's start a diet to lose some weight and keep good energy levels!"" and my right shoulder demon. ""Nah, You're too tired, go take a nap and you'll feel better"". Sometimes I listened to my demon, sometimes I listened to my angel, sometimes I kept ignoring them and ended up doing something completely compulsive like watching YT videos or play the same PC game (and same gamemode even).   


My life was a mess that I was unable to clean up. Last year I tried edibles for the first time. At first I was with my friends but went home early. When I was riding an uber home, I started to notice the effect and BOY did it make me aware of everything.  I was feeling like if everything was vibration. Anyway, arrived home, went to my room and when I laid back on my bed, I immediately felt the comfort and paid attention to how good it felt after being tired most of the day.   
Then I played some music and dude, I cried from happiness, sadness (the good kind), empathy... It was like all so new to me.    
So I spent the night talking to some of my friends, having a good time.   
After that night, I knew something was wrong inside of me, either my dopamine levels were to the minimum or there was a mystical area of life that I was unaware of.   
That same month I started going with a psychologist and psychiatrist. Meds helped a little bit, but I was still having my angel-demon issues. That's when I met Sadhguru's YT channel and I am grateful for giving it a chance. Over the course of 6 months it has changed my life ENTIRELY for good. Seriously, go check at least 1 video out!   
Anyway, so I started basic meditation and decided to try meditating while high (half a brownie) and I felt so much energy flowing through me, yet my thoughts were blocking most of it. I was still struggling.  


Now, I quit using cannabis at the beggining of 2021 and decided to dedicate more to meditation. I was feeling better overall, but there was something missing in my life and even though I was no longer being too conflicted by it, I still felt the void in my emotions.  


On my vacation in april, I decided to use brownies again just to enjoy my holidays. This time, I was more aware and conscious. I was feeling connected and meditative. I felt that energy that I was longing for coming through my body. I felt it move across my nervous system and created a rave party between my neurons. That day is the day that I felt REAL emotions for the first time since I was 12.   


After trying so many different things over this last few months, I have come to the point that I use a small bite of a brownie every noon and it helps me to be more creative, active, focused and connected with the people around me.   
Just recently, I connected with uncles, cousins, aunts, friends and even pets. I used to not talk to anybody and now I feel free to share moments with anyone!   
I am so happy, I am planning some BIG things to help other people reach this level of bliss.

2019-10-31 22:15:19,A month of Microdosing,"I decided to start microdosing for the month of October, and every day I took notes on my dosage, my sleep, my mood, my food intake, etc. I tried to take a sort of scientific approach to see if for me it is worth it to continue to microdose. I’d like to share my results now that the month is over. 

Some info about me: female, 28 years old, height- 5’6, weight- ~115lbs. Diagnosed with an eating disorder (restrictive type) , and Borderline Personality Disorder. I was at a good place mentally, not struggling greatly with either of my mental illnesses. Not in therapy, not on any medications. Definitely not cured or in total control of my mind either. The most I do to help myself mentally is occasionally meditate, or practice mindfulness.

Dosages: I decided to start with 0.10 g of ground mushrooms the first day. I had never taken mushrooms before. I skipped a day, then decided to take the threshold dose of 0.25g to see if this was in fact my personal threshold. It was definitely more of a high than a microdose. So after that, every other day I only took 0.10-0.15g, always from a jar of ground dry mushrooms. Occasionally taken with lionsmane mushrooms. Usually taken in the morning, after eating breakfast. 

Results: I wanted to take mushrooms because I have trouble regulating my emotions, I struggle with a lot of background noise in my mind that causes me to struggle with things like body image and interaction with people in my life. I noticed and even my husband observed that I had a great improvement emotionally. Outburst of anger were almost none existent, and when something like that did come up, I was able to better handle and discuss the situation rather than blowup. I find far less background chatter even after meals which was a huge game changer in my eating disorder. In general I was in a good mood all month which is not normal for me. Things at my job that usually will upset me the whole day seemed to sort of roll off my back. I seem to find looking people in the eye easier, which is not something I was expecting to improve. I used to have trouble looking in the mirror, it use to cause me to dissociate, but now I have no trouble with it, I look and I’m like “yep, that’s me, and that’s ok”, it’s hard to explain I guess but maybe someone can relate. 

Conclusion: I have run out of shrooms now, I took my last 0.15g today, and am going to observe and note how I am until I am able to begin microdosing again. I hope to post another update with those observations in the future (possibly a month from now). For me, shrooms have had a great impact and I am grateful for the control it has helped me take over my own mind and emotions.

I will gladly answer any questions and would love to discuss this further!



*****EDIT (12/1) Update: So it’s been a month since I stopped microdosing. The first week was rough. It only took a few days for everything to be out of my system. I got a little depressed. I mostly went back to business as usual mentally and emotionally. However it took about two weeks for my eating disorder thoughts to fully come back. So I started taking just lions mane again, that seems to help a little bit. But, I think that one month was not long enough for me to see lasting benefits. Once the shrooms are done growing, I will definitely begin microdosing again. I wish I could be more thorough with my update, but my productivity greatly declined after I stopped microdosing as well.",22,3451,4,634,0
2020-11-20 18:18:36,The experience of Rage,"I'm on my second week of microdosing .2 mg psilocybin. My intention in my microdosing experiment is to become aware of subconscious blocks that have kept me neurologically  trapped in a habitual way of living. I want to be free and aware.

The first week was blissful. I felt like I was in a present moment wakeful state the whole week. Come day 1 week 2, however,  I was angry, enraged the whole day with my mind spinning out of control.  I laid down on my bed in the evening and dropped the mental narrative of why I was so pissed off and just allowed myself to feel the rage in the body without a story about it.  After a time, the rage didn't feel bad anymore. The feeling of pure anger actually felt blissful and alive. And then it lifted. Whoa! I had been carrying a clench in my solar plexus my whole life and it was gone. What a gift. I'm very very grateful.",22,866,4,166,0
2020-07-16 12:42:54,"No Sourcing - Illegal or otherwise. Keep the subreddit alive. If in doubt, don't.","Hi all, it's been a joy seeing this subreddit grow as well as the fantastic discussions and reports from users that are actualising the benefits of microdosing. This is a great community and I'm very happy to see that its users act with kindness and helpfulness - as we're all on the same journey of healing or self-improvement.

Recently we've had numerous issues with users breaking the No Sourcing rules as well as advertisements within the subreddit by ""vendors"" that have proven to be fraudulent. So I thought I'd emphasize this subreddit's rules around sourcing and specify what this covers.

Reddit's content policy found [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/reddits-policy-against-transactions) states:

>You may not use Reddit to **solicit or facilitate** any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services, including:  
>  
>•  Drugs, including [alcohol and tobacco, or any controlled substances](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/external-links-vendors-alcohol) (except advertisements placed in accordance with our [advertising policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy))

&#x200B;

In order to abide by this content policy, in /r/microdosing, users **must not**:

**Request, mention or give sources of legal or illegal drugs. Such as:**

* Asking for sources, vendors or websites
* Discussing or linking to specific vendors, even within private messages. This includes clearnet vendors selling drug analogs such as 1P-LSD as well as mushroom spores. 
   * *If you're interested in growing mushrooms for use in microdosing, try* /r/druggardenning*,* /r/shrooms*,* /r/sporetraders *or* /r/unclebens. Although /r/sporetraders is for **microscopy use only.** Buying spores for growing is still technically illegal and as such should not be discussed with vendors in that subreddit. Ensure you follow the rules of any subreddits you may join.
* ""Where can I find \[substance\] in \[location\]?""-type questions

**Facilitate sourcing in any way - however vague. Such as:**

* Mentioning specific locations e.g. ""Any microdosers in {my area}?"" as these types of posts are used by vendors/scammers in order to find potential customers/victims
* Informing users of what to search to find vendors
* Enabling or guiding usage of the darknet or cryptocurrency to purchase controlled substances

**Advertise vendors or yourself as a vendor. Such as:**

* Posting images of controlled substances that are obviously product advertisements
* Offering to supply drugs in comments or posts, even as an implication. E.g. ""Message me"", ""DM me for help""

*In general, if your post or comment would make it easier for someone to obtain drugs (legal or illegal), then it is not permitted.*

&#x200B;

>**A Cautionary Tale**  
>  
>Recently we were informed by one of our users that they had been scammed out of hundreds of dollars by another user purporting to be a vendor. This ""vendor"" had set up a fake company website to take payment for a product they would then never receive.  
>  
>If somebody offers to supply controlled substances to you through Reddit then be wary, as this is a very common scam. Try not to fall for vague marketing posts that advertise these products. A legitimate vendor would most likely not need to advertise through Reddit so take it as a red flag.

**Please utilise the report button** on any posts or comments you feel may be violating these rules. This helps us to identify and remove troublesome content much quicker.

As this subreddit grows, it is important to remember these rules as breaking them poses a real risk to the subreddit. If Reddit administration decides that this subreddit goes against its content policy (by enabling the facilitation of transactions involving controlled substances) then it could get shut down without any option for a reversal. This recently happened to /r/drugstashes which you can read more about in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/f9f1mb/rdrugstashes_suddenly_got_banned_today_for_no/).

This subreddit helps many of its users to improve their lives and it being shut down would be of massive detriment to many. As such, we must try our hardest to keep this from happening.

&#x200B;

Please feel free to ask questions or discuss these rules in the comments.

All the best,

2021-07-12 20:17:53,Just finished two great books about microdosing and psychedelics.,"The first is [A REALLY GOOD DAY BY AYELET WALDMAN](https://bulletpointreading.com/2021/04/19/a-really-good-day-by-ayelet-waldman/). Ayelet Waldman expirements with micro-dosing LSD for 30 days to solve her health problems and achieve equanimity.

My favorite takeaway: “What if mood is a choice?”

Second book is maybe even more interesting: [HOW TO CHANGE YOUR MIND BY MICHAEL POLLAN](https://bulletpointreading.com/2021/07/12/how-to-change-your-mind-by-michael-pollan/). This one encompasses all psychedelics but one quote really shifted my perception of reality: “Our perceptions of the world offer us not a literal transcription of reality but rather a seamless illusion woven from both the data of our senses and the models in our memories. Normal waking consciousness feels perfectly transparent, and yet it is less a window on reality than the product of our imaginations – a kind of controlled hallucination.”",65,917,9,124,0
2021-01-09 08:04:42,Took a 2 month break and came back. It changed my life.,"I have been microdosing every 3 days switching between LSD and Psilocybin for years taking week or month long breaks every so often while also having full trips about 4 times a year.

I accidentally got incredibly busy and kept forgetting to ingest my doses and life continued to went on.. for 2 months.

Today I did 0.2g of Penis Envy mushrooms and had one of the best and most interesting days in a while. I have been genuinely shocked at how noticeably it impacted my day... I'm assuming due to the break.

I am a musician and the creativity was pouring out.. experimenting and making connections on my instruments much more natural than normal. My empathy for my (lately) annoying roommate shot up and the irritation faded. I wouldn't say less anxiety, but the way I interacted with it was more curiosity based and non judgemental.

I felt like I was hitting home runs all day long.

Sometimes all we need is a bit of a break to appreciate the value of things.",55,964,12,174,0
2020-11-26 15:54:59,My Grandma asked me to help administer her first microdoses (Psilocybin),"My grandma is 83 and is the general of our family. She's an old school Jewish Soviet woman who has never experimented with anything. In light of our family gatherings and my mycological hobby she came to me after and asked if the microdose could help her with her joint pain, anxiety, and overall mood in light of the passing of my grandfather who she held so dear. I know from personal micro doses it is a mood enhancer and body relaxer. I just want to make sure my babushka will be in good hands. It's off my own grow and I would administer with her favorite tea. 

I come on here just to see what you guys think about administering micros to someone at such an old age? She was just worried that she would go to into the mind part of it yet, I assured what I would dose her, nothing over .3g, at what was appropriate for body effects and a mind release that will help her possibly gather the stones to walk across the path of relief.",72,936,11,181,0
2020-06-26 15:03:18,"I want to micro-dose for my depression, but my fiancé wants me on antidepressants instead..",I’m 21 and I don’t think my fiancé understands microdosing at all. I try to explain but she creates this mental barrier once she hears the word “mushrooms”. She thinks I’m just getting high to escape my depression until I get used to it. But that’s not the case. I hear so many bad things about antidepressants and I just want to be myself again. I’m sorry but my mental health comes before anything because I’m not letting my daughter see me in one of my suicidal depressive states.. I’m gonna micro-dose behind her back but how much is the MAX I can take without getting high at all!!! Do I need a scale to weigh it or how do I eye ball how much I take??,91,656,15,127,0
2019-10-07 16:45:51,Microdosing LSD is absolutely awesome.,"im on 10ug currently and it feels like a less tweaky version of Adderall without the annoying side effects. Acid is a godsend it makes life so much more enjoyable. I can really recommend it to anyone. I always searched for a stim without the appetite loss, comedown or sleeplessness and i found just that with acid",38,314,5,57,0
2019-06-19 18:29:02,First artwork since I started microdosing,"Sorry if this doesn't belong here. I'm a full-time commercial artist, and just began microdosing last week. I wanted to share my first piece produced since I began microdosing. Not particularly psychedelic, but microdosing definitely helped me to be looser and more creative in my drawing style, while also helping me hone in on the best ways to visually communicate ideas. Usually the ideas/sketching phase of the process feels like pulling teeth, but since I started microdosing, the ideas have been flowing.

# Introduction

A summary of posts from your amicable r/microdosing team 🎳

Hopefully some of these posts will help you on your journey for whatever reason you have chosen to take this path down the [***'yellow brick road'***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_brick_road) .  And with time and patience achieve a better quality of life. 🧘‍♀️🧘‍♂️

My experience over the last couple of years is that some of the posters are not microdosing correctly because they do not have all the facts, which instigated the FAQ series.

Also, I read some have had negative experiences and they became disheartened. And I see others saying there is a no effect and when you dig further, users are cutting their tabs. LSD tabs are not laid evenly, people! Watch this space (assuming you are in this universe at the time of reading 😉)

I hope this post is not too long and overwhelming for some but relax and take your time - [it's a marathon not a sprint.😅](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/fzj7tf/a_gentle_reminder_to_those_starting_out_to/)

# Getting Started: Mod Posts

**Please Note**: *If you are trying microdosing for the first time, please try experimenting on a day off from work or any important obligations, and/or driving and operating machinery. Because psychedelics can effect everyone differently, you may feel different or impaired, and your sweet spot dose may be lower, so it is best to experiment on days off until you’ve dialed in your dose.*

Never Stop Learning 📖 Good Luck 👍 Be Kind & Stay Safe 🍄❤️ (Mush Love)",94,34914,14,3132,0
2019-11-25 06:19:20,Cautionary Tale About The Holidays,"23 Y/o M.

Last year I was on a break from smoking weed which I used for Anxiety/Depression/Attention/Trauma issues.

I wanted to try MDing since it wouldn't show up on a drug test. I had a tab sold as 100ug dissolved into a ML flask. I wanted to take 15ug as I thought it would be best since I am an experienced lsd user.

It was thanksgiving day and I was dreading spending the day with the people who barely know me yet still insist on acting like they give a fuck about me.

As I was making the 2 hour drive about halfway through I began to feel a very familiar feeling in my body that was starting to overtake the dysphoric feeling i often experience. As the drive went on I began to realize that I was on a threshold dose of lsd much more than 15ug could do.

I arrived at the event and played it cool greeting my family and ended up going into the bathroom. In good lighting my pupils were normal sized but in the dimly lit bathroom mirror my pupils would expand into saucer plates when the light stopped hitting them.

I ended up talking to almost all of my uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents, parents, and siblings, which I would almost never do because of anxiety and depressed mood. I grew closer to everyone that day. I played my best ping pong games ever with my dad and cousins. I Spoke about my new experiences in the job force with my uncles who had also worked where I am employed. I sat in the grass and played with my dog while it chased around my brother's new mini drone.

On the way home I was crying because I was sad I had to go home from an event that i had resented and almost not even gone to. I felt so much love that day that it almost felt like I was in immediate withdraws from oxytosin? I had not experienced that sense of family since before I was traumatized as a young kid. It was honestly a perspective shifting experience 

It ended up that the tab I had procured from my solution was misrepresented and was actually more around the 205 ug dosage range. Mind you I didn't really have any sorts of intoxicating effects, Just mood, openness and awareness boosts.

Although this was a positive experience for me, I feel that if I had not been familiar with that headspace, that I would have possibly been thrown off and ended up having alot of anxiety, negative mood, paranoia and closed myself off even more than normal.

So this is a reminder to everyone to dose responsibly by taking extra precautions like these: Source from verified and trustworthy sources. Test your dosage method when you have an ideal time by yourself. And testing your stash is always recommended. If you want some more tips they are only a google or youtube video away. Peace out guys, happy holidays and I hope everyone is doing well!! :)",34,2752,5,514,0
2019-12-03 17:57:51,I look more attractive while microdosing?,"Since I started microdosing every time I dose attractive woman always look at me and start conversations with me out of nowhere.

I have noticed that my pupils dilate a little bit every time I dose. I have read that dilated pupils make you look more attractive and friendly, it’s also a sign that you are attractive to someone.

I was thinking that way until a couple of hours ago when I noticed my mind quieting down a notch and then I realised hey... I'm not normally like this, normally I feel like I have several layers of thought all going on in parallel and my mind switching between these, but now its like I have only one ""main channel"" and if I could describe it I'd say its the now channel, the now what's in front of me for what ever task I'm doing at the moment channel. Hmmm interesting... does any of this ring a bell to you folks? the last dose I had was 2 days ago. (Dried 0.4 - 0.6 of a gram) Now I feel the need to phase out the drug and pay more attention to my normal self, and compare the two, I'm trying to make memory of the state I'm normally in but since I'm in the ""Now Channel"" I cant think of it much...

I can't get this new habit and decided to add microdosing ritual to my morning routine. 2 stamps of LSD inside of 0.5L bottle of water. Every morning before shower I'm making one drink. Now it's day 12 of my experiment and I'm so excited about my new habit. I also created this T-shirt for myself just for fun. And giving this design for free, so everyone can print it.

2020-10-26 22:43:43,Think I figured out why some people get depressed from microdosing,"I’m writing this now on 10 ug LSD I took this morning. I have been slowly realizing that each time I MD, I am more brutally honest with myself about things. 

Problem is, when I get honest with myself it becomes overwhelmingly obvious how many things about my life that I hate. Microdosing, I believe, just makes them come to the surface more. I’ve definitely had this experience more so with Macrodosing, but microdosing does it in a way that your not tripping obviously.
My point is, when I get honest with myself, I get depressed & anxious because of how many things I think are wrong with me and the sheer amount of things brought to the surface that would not have connected in my brain otherwise.

Can anyone else relate to this?

Edit:
I’m not saying this is necessarily a bad thing. It’s just something I’ve noticed. Sometimes those days are hard, but I’m hoping in the long run if I can write those thoughts down and work on them off a MD, then some of my issues can begin to get better",66,995,11,185,0
2019-11-15 11:20:43,My experience microdosing in college,"I want to share my experience for those who could benefit as much as I did. I studied language and materials engineering in undergrad.

All through college I experimented with ways to improve my focus/memory etc and had developed a decent stack of nootropics and a reliable protocol for studying. I considered myself a good student, but I would underperform on exams; usually by messing up some calculation or not reading the questions carefully enough. It was all the time and I became very frustrated. I knew it was related to test anxiety but I didn’t have a remedy for fixing this.

During my last semester a friend of mine was able to get me a tab of LSD. I did volumetric dosing and I cannot understate how good it really is for attaining a strong but wieldable flow state. My test anxiety evaporated. But more than that, I had a command of my faculties that I have not experienced before or since. 

During some particularly difficult 9 days where I had 6 exams, I found myself performing at the top of my game. I managed to get an A on 5/6. This was from 3 doses of ~10-15ug spread out over the 9 day period. Hard problems became doable AND fun. My spatial capabilities increased several fold. I hesitate to say it made me “smarter”. It definitely made me more competent and capable. Imagine being really good at honing a sword edge but being a terrible swordsman. This is like being able to wield the sword with efficiency and effectiveness. 

There is no magic bullet and I cannot guarantee anyone else will have a similar experience to what I had. 

Personally, I believe that LSD is THE greatest nootropic on planet earth. This is a technology that has been withheld from us because of fear and paranoia.

If you seek out LSD or Psilocybin mushrooms, use it with caution and be smart. With great power comes great responsibility.",36,1841,5,329,0
2019-09-15 16:26:26,Microdosing makes me better at parenting,"While I really love my kids (5 and 2), they're a lot of work, real work at this age, hence the use of the verb parenting in the title. The toddler just loves cars so much he would jump in front of them, he's also a little Houdini finding new ways to escape to the streets... Going outside is stressy as you can imagine.

Add to this that my wife can't always be there to help out too and you might understand that the weekends can be stressful, especially if you planned on doing other things (cleaning, paying the bills,...).

Yesterday I had a really bad day. I intended on doing some useful things in the house but couldn't. That started to eat me up and started a negative spiral. that of course makes me negative-not fun-grumpy dad. And guess what, kids don't become better behaved when you're angry... So by the end of the day I was just empty, empty and tired from being stuck in a negative thought loop all day.
So I decided to take a microdose of 8ug LSD the next morning.

What a difference.
Instead of fretting and getting stuck in negative thoughts, I just got in the moment, and that positive feeling is reinforced in the kid's behaviour,making them easier to handle.
I also become playful, entering their play, which at their age is of course awesome.
Spontaneity also surges, especially at the playground where I enjoy conversation with other parents and even enjoying the moment instead of seeing it as another thing to check of the list of activities for the day.

The extra energy-boost is also a big a help given that they are awake at 6.00 with too much energy.

While I do feel some guilt (do I need drugs to enjoy my children?) I look at it from a pragmatic point of view.
Parenting is work and isn't always 'fun'. So why not use my microdoses to make my personal and emotional life better and create nice memories for everybody?
The alternative being MD'ing for work or resorting to alcohol to numb the stress of the day away as a more socially accepted but harmful alternative.


Oh, and when they went to bed tired and satisfied I still had the positive energy left to do pchores like cleaning and paying last week's bills.

TLDR;Used a microdose of LSD in the weekend, spent the day with the kids and we we all had a great day.

2022-07-17 06:14:53,"We should treat microdosing as a spiritual compass, not a productivity hack.","In my humble opinion, of course. I'm aware that we have our personal reasons for microdosing. I just wanted to share that whenever I md with a worldly mindset; such as having an edge in the workplace or life in general, I end up confused and anxious. My fears consume me and I look for retreat, away from the dog eat dog world. 

But when I md without the intention of being one step ahead of others or being better at ""the game"", just a pure intention of being a better human being. I become filled with love, for myself and others. It's like a piece of my soul is returning. I understand (once again) that there's more to life than material pursuits and it's more than a competition. 

But maybe you all know this already. I wrote this so my future self would not forget. Peace and love. ✌️

Some clarifications:

I am not against being productive. I simply mean that we should focus on the internal before going to the external. That's what I meant by treating it as a spiritual compass rather than a productivity hack. Productivity follows when you are *attuned to yourself* (which is what spirituality means to me, not necessarily being religious). 

After all, psychedelic literally means ""mind-manifesting"". It's an amplification or manifestation of what's inside us.",76,1274,12,223,0

I just want to say that I'm the kind of person who can't keep a basic plant alive, but the experience of choosing, setting up and growing my own mushrooms is incredibly empowering!

I own a small business and about three weeks ago I received a call from a new client who sort of tricked me into these add-on services for no additional charge. Customer acquisition is vital to my business, and in the past I would’ve bent over backwards and agreed to their request. 

Before we begin service, there’s always an initial face-to-face meeting. When the time was right, in a very agreeable tone, I said, “Ohhhh, I found a few local businesses that provide the additional services you mentioned. Would you like me to forward you the information?” Then when service began, we were asked to change the time to 7:00am (before business hours), and I said there’s no availability at that time. 

Saying no to anyone, especially precious new clients, was never in my wheelhouse before I began microdosing. For the first time in my life, my inner voice is strongly aligned with who the world sees. I am complete.",24,1108,6,192,0

2020-11-15 01:21:39,Microdosing didn’t start truly “working” for me until I got sober,"Just want to share this in case other people are underwhelmed with the anti-depression, pro-productivity effects touted by many proponents of microdosing.

It wasn’t until I quit smoking weed, drinking, vaping, and masturbating that microdosing really started kicking into gear and help me transform my life in many positive ways. Although I will say that the 6-7 months I spent microdosing while also partaking in other substances, while I was still mostly depressed and chronically exhausted, were still majorly helped by the microdosing, was even if it didn’t feel like the “magic” pill I had hoped it would be. 

Ultimately, it has helped me get sober in a way that I’m not sure I would have been able to without it, so I don’t consider it time wasted necessarily. But the substance use was holding me back a ton.

Nowadays I only microdose when I feel inclined to, usually 1 or 2 days a week instead of the 4-5 I was doing when starting out. And I feel much better overall. I anticipate that by the time I run out of mushrooms, over the course of the next year, I won’t even feel inclined to get more and will likely let this go too.

Just wanted to share this in case anyone else is feeling discouraged that microdosing doesn’t seem like all it’s cracked up to be for you. If that’s the case, I would suggest looking at your habits, and trying to examine how anything you may be doing regularly, especially things that alter your neurochemistry, might be holding you back.

EDIT: seems like I struck a nerve with people about the masturbation aspect, that wasn’t really the point of this post. The point is that if you experiment with changing your habits, and you find that changing something that legitimately does impact how you feel in a positive way, then stick with it.",65,1781,11,315,0
2020-02-13 00:25:12,Ready to live,"I've been microdosing since June of last year to help with depression.  Along my way in life I picked up some beliefs and habits that I now realize are preventing me from being actually alive. I've been using weed and antidepressants for most of my life.  I've been with my partner for 26 years. We have four kids. I've survived by believing that my feelings and emotions didn't matter. That my life is supposed to be hard. That living is supposed to be awesome and I'm just not good enough for that. I thought my partner always new better and could be trusted. He comes from a good family and I didn't. 
Well after spending yet another day in bed due to feeling defeated against life I say fuck it! I'm gonna live! I'm gonna feel however the fuck I want to feel and not judge myself anymore. I'm gonna let life love me and stop pushing against it, against myself. 
I've been working hard in a health care job while my partner will not look for work.  He has been gaslighting me for years in regards to my emotions. My depression disorder. We're are now so far in debt and it really bothers me that all the responsibility is on me to provide for our life. 
I've felt trapped for years. And now thanks to my ability to actually accept what I feel I know I can do better. I have to do better. I want to do better.

Since microdosing I can see so clearly how alcohol affects everything. Sleep, mood, appetite, mental and physical performance. I can also see how it’s a double edged sword, calms your nerves but it’s also a depressant. Now I easily avoid alcohol and feel euphoria the next day instead of that run down feeling. I am still able to enjoy a beer or drink with friends now and then but I don’t have that feeling I need it to function anymore. It’s still a strange feeling though because I remember good times with some beers but now I’d rather just go to bed early and sleep good and do something fun in the morning instead.",48,709,6,129,0
2021-06-22 22:42:01,Microdosing may have saved my life..,"I'm around 40 years old and since I am 28 i suffer from depression. On and off antidepressants. I literally escaped twice when i quit everything and travelled Asia, each time for around 2 years. but even there the depression hit and in the last 5 years I became a regular drinker. I came back from my last drip 4 years ago and the alcoholism got worse, way worse. I am back on antidepressants since 3 years, I held a job I am functioning but since 3 years I drank every evening. I usually started on the way back home with 1-2 beers and then 1-3 bottles of wine until I pass out in the early evening. Sleep / stay in bed for 10-14 hours and back to work. Also i gained 35kg in 3 years.. Because of laziness and fast food. Also, no girlfriend, no sex, no relationship in the last  4 years, very low functioning libido because of depression and just too much alcohol.  This changed also in the last weeks. I started to look how I dress again, shave and so on.. just gained more confidence overall.

So 3 weeks ago I watched this documentary about 1cp - LSD and how it is legal in Germany right now. Probably pretty soon they will forbid it but now its legal. So I ordered some and tested it with 60  μg. And it was no fake it worked. So during the last 3 weeks i took every other day 20 μg  and on weekends / days off 60 μg. I know this is not microdosing anymore more like minidosing but anyways it helped me to finally get my ass off of the PC and start to work out and do long sporty walks like almost everyday. I didnt do any sports in the last 3 years .. just had no energy. Also, though i still drink it became much more of a enjoyment. For example today i had 20 μg  before work in the morning and after work i took another 40 μg , went for a 2 hour walk and now I am drinking my 4th and last beer... more for enjoyment. When before i was just bulking down my wine to get drunk and pass out. 3 months ago my doctor said I have the the body signs and illnesses like a 60 year old: sleep apnoe, extreme high blood pressure, COPD, and so on. No wonder when you spend 3 years with no movement and drinking and eating like a maniac.

So I finally decieded to quit my job (again) and first go travel Mexico for the winter and then return next summer to help out on a farm in the swiss alps with more physical work in the green in a really nice environment.

2021-10-15 15:22:30,"ADHD, Aspergers and CPSD has gone....","I just wanted to share this incase anyone In a similar situation is thinking about microdosing. 

I've lived with ADHD, ASD and CPTSD all my life and it's been incredibly difficult. With my ADHD I couldn't focus on one task at a time, I'd be so easily distracted, very nervous and on edge and always have too much energy inside I'd always be restless. With my Aspgers, this would cause extreme anxiety in most of my day to day life and I could react very directly and with anger in situations without knowing. CPSD also effected my day to day life with depression, anxiety and usually having some type of fear inside me. 

I started microdosing around a month ago, I  just go out and pick liberty caps and make 0.15g capsules to take. I've heard some people say this is too low and others say its too high, I'm not an expert, but I went with 0.15g and its changed my life in a month..

I'm also not being exact or specific with the amount of days in between, I've taken one and waited a few days, taken 2 one day and waited a few days or just mixed it up as to how I'm feeling, but no more than 2 in one day and taking a break after.


I honestly feel like all of my problems and symptoms have gone, I feel like a new person, waking up happy and free.

At work now I can hyper focus, not easily distracted and I don't have any nervous energy anymore. I can sit so relaxed and chilled now. I even manage to finish work and just sit and watch a film without changing it or being distracted on phone etc. My anxiety has gone and in situations that I know I would have exploded with anger, I'm sitting calm and chilled thinking positively.

In the past I've struggled with depression from trauma as a child, something I'd struggle to blank out and I couldn't think about it as I'd feel sick in my stomach and really ill with sadness and depression.  Now if I sit and think back, there's no negative emotions and I'm thinking in a positive frame of mind and don't feel depressed or ill. 

I'm so much more happier about life and about me as a person now.

2022-06-02 17:01:51,2 weeks in...and life is beautiful again,"I felt compelled to share my story so far with microdosing psilocybin, so here we go. If this inspires one person out there to give this a try, this post will have done it's job..

My background: By all societal measures, I have it all. Two wonderful kids, a perfect little home exactly where I want to live, and business that supports my family well and gives me so much free time and flexibility, but with all of that I have been dealing with depression for most of my adult life. Never to the point of considering taking my life, but just a lack of any joy. Every day feeling ""meh,"" tired and truly any positive emotion I felt wasn't sincere. I just told myself I should feel this way. After doing a lot of research on microdosing and it's abilities to shake the snow globe of a mind with very rigid thought processes, I knew this was for me..and I hoped it would work.

The call for action: About a month ago, I hit rock bottom mentally. I wanted to do nothing. Being awake was the worst part of my day. I felt like the entire universe was against me, nothing was going right and felt completely hopeless. Out of pure luck, a friend I hadn't spoken to in years messaged me about something completely unrelated and the conversation turned to mushrooms and psilocybin. He had been microdosing for a bit and after hearing his story, this felt perfect for me. I began taking matters into my own hands mentally and began meditating, listening to & reading philosophers speak on our existence (Alan Watts, Marcus Aurelius, Sam Harris to name a few) and I put in the mental work. I also revamped my entire diet, started exercising more often, formulating better sleep patterns and cutting mental waste (I only pick up my iPhone if I NEED to do something and NEVER scroll social media). I also began to journal, which has been a wonderful therapeutic benefit and a way to track my journey. I knew going in that psilocybin wouldn't do all the work itself.

Dosing: I have been taking .14g of psilocybin 4 days a week then 3 days off (Monday-Thursdays) in addition to 1,000mg of Lion's Mane supplement, but that started later so I could feel the microdose working on it's own. I have also been on 10mg of Lexapro for 3 years and just spoke to my doctor about weening off. The time has never felt more right to get off my SSRI.

How I feel: Words fail, mostly, but my mind has never been clearer, calmer and focused in my daily life. I feel a new warmth inside of my body and a deep appreciation for the infinite now we are living in. I WANT to play with my kids for no reason other than to play. I am getting lost in music again. Being in and around nature is all the peace I need. I enjoy being in deep thought without distractions. I am laser focused on my work when I sit down to accomplish tasks. I just love being here. Feeling these wonderful feelings made me realize how pointless life is without all of this. The only reason we are here is to enjoy our experience, everything else is noise. It has only been 2 weeks but I hope with all of the hard mental & physical work I've done combined with the most glorious and beautiful thing to exist on this Earth 🍄 will continue helping.

2019-07-20 12:55:53,I have drastically reduced alcohol consumption by switching from LSD to mushrooms for microdosing,"I've been microdosing LSD for nearly 5 years and it has helped me overcome many bad habits, and helped me created healthy new ones, but I always continued drinking because for me, drinking and microdosing was a very enjoyable experience. 

&#x200B;

However, since moving from LSD to mushrooms, I've noticed that the alcohol no longer compliments the microdosing experience, it takes away from it, thus leaving me with an easy choice, and I prefer the mushrooms all day long.

&#x200B;

Why did I change to mushrooms? I really love receiving an almost daily boost in the morning, it keeps me happy and peaceful long after the effects have worn off, so being able to do this 5 days on 2 days off is a massive bonus for my particular needs. I also seem to be sleeping much better the whole experience is much more chill.

So when I say drastically reduce, I mean I've gone to an almost daily drinker, I'd have a day or twos break every week or so but sometimes went nearly two weeks without a break, I've gone from that, to not having a single drink in about 10 days, and I've only just realised the significance of that because I wasn't trying, and I didn't mean to do it, I just noticed drinking wasn't pleasurable, and almost automatically stopped without noticing or trying.",97,1286,14,229,0

2020-08-17 16:44:43,"Microdosing, Anxiety and Experiential Avoidance","Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experience and I hope it can help others that suffer of anxiety and depression like me, after my girlfriend passed out 3 years ago from stomach cancer I started to have many mental issues that made me think that I was just going crazy, panic attacks, shaking very often and very scary thoughts that were from suicidal thoughts to a very big spectrum of the worst things you can imagine, also physical symptoms like loosing mobility of a part of my face and digestive problems... fortunately i could grab a little bit of energy after a panic attack In the middle of the night that made me realize that my mind was damaged but it was a part of my being that I could fix somehow, I had this separation from my mind and myself...anyway during this years and specially during this quarantine i realize that a very very big part of all that was my experiential avoidance, I was just scared to feel all that sadness and all those uncomfortable feelings that were making pressure within my body like a pressure cooker, with the help of meditations specially focused on emotional release, mindfulness, yoga, music, and mushrooms I’ve been connecting with my emotions step by step i didn’t realize how much was inside me, I’ve been crying at least 2 or 3 times a week las few months without any drama just releasing, even I’m enjoying every cry, every drop, and after every cry I have this afterglow that makes me feel happy for being alive... At the same time that new connection with my emotions/body the one that makes me aware of my anxiety it’s the same that now makes me dance the music that I like like never before and makes me feel alive... so this is for the people that thinks that this is just not for them because psychedelics shows you what you need to see, not what you want to see, let’s loose the fear of feeling, hugs and sorry for this long post I hope it can help someone :)",47,1923,5,355,0
2021-06-10 06:48:29,Microdosing and acceptance,"So I began microdosing for depression and PTSD. When I started I didn't really set proper intention and still reaped some benefits but ultimately felt just as lost as before. However I did realize my mistake and promptly corrected it. Coming to the conclusion that microdosing was a tool not a cure all, I started a proper health plan.

I started eating healthy and meal prepping. I started exercising and meditation. I started reading instead of choosing to watch TV or play video games. I started pursuing passions and interests. I began a routine of healthy behavior and started to feel better.

What I really learned through microdosing is acceptance is the key to happiness. I struggled with being comfortable in my skin and struggled with acceptance of others ultimately because I could not accept myself. Then I started to feel better about myself and less insecure through a simple concept. Be the person I would be proud of. I became comfortable in my skin and less judgemental of myself. Anxiety was then relieved because I stopped putting unnecessary pressure on myself.

Anyway what the bigger change was how I viewed others. My acceptance of other people ultimately led to more positive interactions. I realize now that that's what we all want. To be accepted by others. Through acceptance of others I gain better acceptance of myself. I now encourage people to be who they want to be and celebrate our differences.

Jimmi Hendrix said it best ""the world will know peace when the power of love outweighs the love of power"".

 Love and acceptance feel good to me. Happiness is achieved through love and acceptance. Happiness is success. In order to truly be successful you must be happy! So the gift that microdosing gave me is acceptance.",26,1751,3,298,0
2020-10-05 15:06:56,I'm starting to understand what microdosing does to me,"I've been microdosing LSD for a few weeks, tried different doses and settled for 10μg. With this I don't feel high but I really see the effects it's having on me. Mostly it completely removes my negativity. And I think I'm starting to understand how it works.

I thinks it disconnects me a bit from what I feel. Not that I feel nothing - I actually think I feel emotions and sensations more intensely - but it's like I'm not overwhelmed by my feelings and I can analyse them while feeling them.

2 examples:

 - a physical one: 3 days ago I held a coffee mug that was too hot, and instead of rushing to set it on the table, I could analyse the sensation of the temperature on my skin without really feeling pain.

 - a psychological one: today wasn't a really good day at work, I realised I have to resign and find another job. I feel really sad because I like working there, and I'm afraid of searching for a new job during this weird time, but I don't feel depressed or powerless. I know what's ahead of me, it will be hard, but I feel like I'll be able to do it.

2021-02-02 17:15:53,MD Psilocybin: alcohol becomes more of the devil,"I’ve been a frequent drinker my whole adult life, ranging from a chronic daily fun drunk in my punk rock youth to a solitary depressive almost bottle of wine a day drinker. Lately I’ve had a much better handle on it, maybe 2 glasses of wine a day. 

When I started MDing psilocybin I just naturally didn’t want to drink often. It’s been a month and in the beginning I had a daily Guinness until my stock ran out and I was at the store I realized I just didn’t need to buy more. 

Fast forward to ovulation and I found myself caving into the urge to fall back on an old favorite hormonal coping combo: Red wine and chocolate cake. I only bought one can of red wine (which still is about two glasses) but I did buy the largest slab of cake I could find :).  What a shitty mistake. I slept horribly, tossing and turning, and feel horrible today. 

The contrast between how I have been feeling lately since starting microdosing (fanstastic, not all the time but my moodier days were not wretched), to how I feel today is eye opening. I KNEW that alcohol and psilocybin isn’t recommended. I still did it, and won’t be doing it again. No thanks.

2019-11-13 19:50:27,I accidentally microdosed my cat.,"I'm a microdoser and I enjoy the effects, and has also noticed that I can spontaneously decide to have a short 20-40 minute trip if I up the dosage during the day and have been dosing on and off for a year or so on various types of shrooms and 1p-lsd and lsd-25 and I've felt nothing but positive effects when it comes to my own mental health.

Now here's the thing, my cat got a fraction of a fraction of a piece (think 0.0001g) of PC inside her when I was crushing my dose up for capsule preparation and that lil' fool ingested it like it was candy.

AFAIK that dose isn't toxic for a cat, but I'm curious about how and why she reacts in the way she does by sniffing out the bag as if it were catnip, a thing she didn't do before she had gotten her own little microdose, and why she all of a sudden starts to meow at me in a very... Curious tone that she has never done before while following me around with an exited look in her eyes as if she actually wants more? (relax, I won't deliberately subject a fucking cat/animal to drugs!) 

I tried bribing her with cheese to get the smug look off of her face but she keeps following me and being even More cute and cuddly than she usually is to no avail.

She even boops me more softly than ever.

I've never experienced a cat on a microdose before so I'm curious on what has happened and if anyone else has had any experience with this weird situation where a cat has became more gentle and has a new sort of glow in her eyes?

Before you judge me I must say I feel like a dick for not being quick on the draw when I noticed a microscopic piece fall down the table because she doesn't like amphetamines, mdma, hasch, weed, any type of benzo or alcohol that she has been close to before, but I had no fucking idea that she would so easily and fearlessly endulge in drug use or else I would have locked the door as I usually do when stupid shit is laying on the table.

I am now on my 4th week of doing 4 days on 3 days off and today something weird happened, I was sitting at my desk getting my life into order, recording meal plans and looking at how much exercise I had achieved in the past couple of weeks (something I never would usually do) I felt more focused at work also which again had been something I hadn't felt in a while.   


I was then reading an article on a wellbeing app I had downloaded and it was talking a lot about negative thoughts and how much they impact our day to day lives and I don't know what came over me but I had this sudden urge to cry with happiness, it was very weird and something I've never experienced before but it was like for the first time in my life I felt like I was actually reaching a turning point and my life was about to get better and most of all I was going to feel better again.

I then just began to cry out of nowhere. Some of the emotions came from feeling overwhelmed but also excited for what's to come on my journey to happiness.   


I expected to feel better from micro-dosing but I thought this would be a gradual thing over time that I wouldn't really notice. I never expected it to smack me in the face quite like it did today but I guess that's the beauty of mushrooms.

2021-03-03 14:13:35,Drug Use for Grown Ups by Dr. Carl Hart,"I was just wondering if anyone in the community has read this book by Dr. Carl Hart and if anyone wanted to have a discussion about it. 

In the book Carl Hart examines misconceptions about drug use across the world and the biases that we all have and divests hurtful myths about drugs and their users. 

The micro-dosing and pot smoking communities have distanced themselves from those of other “harsher” drug users and this is only hurting all drug users on the basis that all drugs should be regulated so everyone can have access. 

The book address the wider systemic issue across the world of drug users and how we need to stand together to educate people further so that we as drug users can stop being scapegoated every few years by conservatism. 

We as micro-dosers aren’t any different in doing our drug of choice in moderation than any other drug user and don’t deserve any better or lesser treatment than non drug users or “harsher” drug users.

This book will help many people to also understand the harmful drug industry our medical industry is also pushing on us and the detrimental effects of taking over the counter medications like ibuprofen and their damage on our livers. Something that’s never talked about considering how harshly everyone is treated for doing illegal drugs.

It also talks about how these drug “epidemics” are not what they seem. Hope to open a cool and chill discourse on this. Or just open some more peoples eyes to the injustices against other drug users. 

It also talks about how many drugs positive effects aren’t even talked about at all and only negatives. As users of LSD, mushrooms and other psychedelic drugs I think we can all realize the potential benefits of all sorts of different drugs and why this stigma shouldn’t exist. 

A broader approach to decriminalized and regulated drugs would mean a better and happier world for everyone. Would love to hear your thoughts! 

Also this is in no way me advocating for people to use “harsher” drugs or any drugs at all. Just that we should have a more open mind and support one another. Also in no way downplaying true addiction to drugs and suffering. Just want more people to realize that those are effects of a broader systemic issue rather than just “being addicted to drugs”

I work from home luckily but the past few weeks I've just been feeling so out of it until I decided to start my journey. 

As someone with ADHD, just focusing on a task I'm bored with can be hard to do. I currently have a messy room because of my depression and yesterday I noticed I was able to pick up some of my mess without feeling so overwhelmed. 

I used to leave empty water bottles just in my room instead of taking them out to the trash (yeah my depression would barely make me leave the room the past few months) but I was able to clean up everything yesterday without even thinking about what a ""chore"" it was. 

I also have been working holistically with meditation and binaural beats and keeping up with gratitude daily so I can get the full healing experience.

I definitely plan on doing this for a total of 6 months or more because I am into healing for the long term and just these short term benefits for me im noticing:

My Personal Benefits:

-Not feeling so overwhelmed
-Able to focus slightly better at work
-Remembering my tasks instead of forgetting instead of leaving the room
-Able to tidy up more in the house
-Emotions don't feel so volatile (i.e. no random mood swings when something triggers me) 
-More motivated to take care of myself and put myself first
-Listening to my body more with healthy eating and exercise

2020-04-09 11:34:49,Let's do some buddy checks!,"Hello everyone and congrats on your decision to begin microdosing.  I wanted to do a quick buddy check on those who may be new to microdosing and those of you who are a few months in with a few 'back to basics' reminders.  I've noticed there has been an uptick in posts in this sub and most if not all are very specific questions about individual experiences and concerns.  I wanted to take a moment to remind everyone to take a step back and reset every once in a while to regain some clarity and evaluate your goals as time in quarantine can have us feeling a little crazy.  So let's do some sanity checks:

1. Less is more with microdosing.  If you're steadily increasing your dose you may want to take a break for a few days. Increasing the amount of time in between doses may benefit you more than a larger dose.  
2. How do you feel? Anxious? A little stiff in the neck? Thoughts racing? If so, let's take a break.  Play with a minimalist approach.  Just because Johnny BigDose is getting great results from 50ug daily doesn't mean 10ug once or twice a week/every other week won't be just as effective for you. Pro Tip: Deep cleaning and decluttering the apartment usually helps me when I'm feeling anxious.  
3. How are you sleeping? Play around with the time of day you are taking your dose.  Sleep will be your balance.  It will make your microdoses 1,000 times more effective. 
4. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!  Stop reading right now and get yourself some water....I'll wait......ok welcome back.  
5. Microdosing is not a cureall and the effects should not be ""felt"".  This is confusing for some and understandably so as it sounds like I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth.  When we say this it means, you shouldn't rely on a single dose to fix everything.  There are some reports that someone takes a single dose, walks down the street and notices how beautiful the flowers are that they never noticed were there before.  This is not microdosing...you're high.  Which is not a bad thing, but we don't want to mislead.  Microdosing is a gradual shift in perception which can take weeks and sometimes months.  But that's ok because it's cheap and there's no finished line that we are trying to race toward.  

That's all for now, hopefully, in the comments, some can fill in some of the gaps that I may have left out but ultimately I'm trying to keep this simple and broad.  Maybe some can share some 'less is more' stories and some encouraging words about taking a step back and evaluating.  Tell us how you're doing, how you're feeling.",27,2551,5,456,0
2020-02-18 14:32:09,Observations after the first week Microdosing Psilocybin,"I tend to babble, but i'll try to edit this into something palatable.

I (47m) suffered from a pretty brutal depression for a long time that really intensified last year. I started researching quite a bit near the end of the year and long story short, decided to give it a try. I think there are a lot of advocates that might turn off a scientifically minded person, however there are PLENTY of advocates that are top notch folks. I was at my wits end so... I was convinced that at least it wouldn't hurt.

Like everybody, I had tripped a few times in college, the last one being a bad experience (bad trip), and now i'm a regular dude with a regular career, wife and kids.

I had taken Welbutrin in the past... and sort of stopped it. My wife has been on SSRI's for years... so I knew what that was all about. She asked me to try them first, but I politely declined.

I'm not a long time Microdoser, only one week, so take everything I say with that in mind. I suspect my advice could change over time as I learn more about the effects and possibilities, or the assets and liabilities moreover, behind this 'drug'.

It was important to me that I grow my own, so I started in late December. Growing took about a month and a half, but I waited as opposed to buying, because I felt it was important to do this whole thing from soup to nuts. There was depression during the wait, but overall, it was a good move.  Once I harvested off my cakes, I had about 3 grams, which is like almost 7 weeks worth. So, here we go.

I took .12g Tuesday, .15g Thursday, and tried .2g on Saturday. I've decided that .15 is the sweet spot for me and I may move to the one day on, two days off regimen, but for now, we'll go with every other day with one extra day off per week. All dosages have pretty much the same effect by the end of the day, but during the day you can feel a little buzzed with a higher dose. You are still going to be functional, but you may be a little zippy, potentially uncomfortable. -edited- (I commented more about feeling a little hi in the comments)

The first two days I took my carefully measured ground up powder with Tea, the third day, I had a capsule that I prepared (size 0, tightly packed). Tea is a good method, no stomach issues, but the capsules are really easy.

I might describe MD'ing this way: Microdosing is to the mood like caffeine is to energy. Except so far, it seems to have lasted a lot longer for the mood. It lasts well into the next day, if not the whole day.  It makes you happier, more apt to laugh. More apt to love. I had no problem with depression induced anger or anxiety which is pretty common for me.  There was no depression at all all last week and that's a different world for me. I was happy, energetic, and focused (though focus isn't widely reported on psy... )

The best thing is, I wasn't depressed and 'sad' around my kids. That's a giant deal. Depression comes with guilt if you are a parent or have a loved one. They don't deserve to be around my shitty depression.

A couple more observations and thoughts that may be useful

* I took it in the morning around 7:00. By 7:45, I could feel something depending on the dosage. But nothing like a trip.
* I had no problems sleeping at night
* I had no motivation problems, in fact, quite the opposite.
* I've been making jokes again :) I didn't do that as much for a long time, and it's nice to make the wife laugh again.
* The wife did NOT know, but she mentioned later (after I told her) that of course it worked because I seemed so happy, so different. But NEVER high.
* Making my own was important. It took awhile, and during that time of course I experienced depression. But it was important to me that I figure out this issue. No, it's not the 'double blind study' backed 'perfect' dosage of some drug that's been tweaked by big pharma and tested for years and nobody spent zillions of dollars on it. But I challenge the assumption that that methodology is better. I'm finding the dosage right for me.
* I created a daily journal/survey (I use [forms.google.com](https://forms.google.com), it talley's results of questions that you create, and you just do it every day). I did it for a month before the md'ing... and continue to do it every day, so I have a somewhat objective historical view of changes that are happening. It looks like this: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-NxyhoH2Oc4gOx6dTIrQGIQ1LfTPRamJPRUVGKjyz9fcrgg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-NxyhoH2Oc4gOx6dTIrQGIQ1LfTPRamJPRUVGKjyz9fcrgg/viewform)
* There may be a little nausea or stomach discomfort, but its not bad.
* I am using size 0 capsules, [https://www.amazon.com/Capsule-Connection-Wholesale-Vegetable-Capsules/dp/B005JDUEYU/ref=sr\_1\_2?keywords=size+0+capsules&qid=1582037003&sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Capsule-Connection-Wholesale-Vegetable-Capsules/dp/B005JDUEYU/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=size+0+capsules&qid=1582037003&sr=8-2) I also purchased a capsule maker,  you can do  100 capsules in 20 minutes. I also have a dedicated coffee grinder.

One last thing, when I started this, I thought that I was doing something wrong, or drugg'y. That is not the case at all. This stuff got a bad wrap for sure. I might suggest NOT being nervous about this stuff, and just go for it.

Happy to answer questions.

I'm always happy to take suggestions.

I'll continue and report back :)

I'm adding this comment from jtk below, because I feel it's very important.

I just want to say a couple things as a longer-term microdoser (1.5 yrs). Remember that you are not “cured” or “done” (in other words, don’t get complacent). I can tell you already know this, but I find it good to remember. My first week was life changing as well, but ups and downs will happen. LEARN FROM THE DOWNS. MDing amplifies everything, good and bad. Enjoy the good and learn from the bad. I wish you continued success. Thanks for the post.",56,5941,7,1025,0
2022-03-23 20:39:27,I was paid a visit by the local police -,"Long story short, I bought a small quantity (15g) of magic truffles from an internet supplier in Holland, these were apparently stopped at the border and an officer came to visit me today

The policeman was very laid back about the whole thing, I was honest about what I'd bought and where from and also that I'd never tried before but wanted to see if there was any benefit for my anxiety

The police have asked me to write them a clarifying email saying the same and with a link to the website I bought them from.  They've said that the matter will go no further with no criminal record or anything official, so I'm not worried about spending time in pokey, but wondering if anyone's had a similar visit and how it panned out.

&#x200B;

Update:

Firstly, thank you for all the comments, some of which highlighted my omission of saying where I'm actually from - it's the UK, so apologies for this.

This morning I contacted a solicitor who subsequently contacted the officer who did the visit.  The officer confirmed to the solicitor that there will be no further action taken, no caution, no interview, nothing.  They accept that it was a simple case of naivety and that's that.  On the question of emailing them details of where I'd made the purchase - it's entirely up to me if I do or don't, and so I won't be doing this, not so much as a need to protect the vendor - they're on the front page of a google search - but why make it more difficult for others

2020-12-13 23:32:57,Never felt so much hate,"I have been feeling pretty low lately and thought I’d try something different.  Last time I used mushrooms I went on a trip eating about 5G over the course of a night, afterwards and for quite some time, better part of 3 years I felt upbeat, happy, content.  This dwindled over time to the point where I feel like a bitter old man...And, I have been having issues in my relationship, resentment, isolation, loneliness despite being married and living with my wife and son.

So, in an attempt to bring myself back, I started microdosing (nano?) mushrooms about a month ago, i was using 0.05g every other day and seeing no difference in my mood, then I bumped up to 0.1g for a couple weeks, and still nothing to this weekend I said fuck it and took 0.25g Friday and Saturday.

Yesterday and today I have felt love and joy for nearly everything, happiness flows through me, I genuinely feel content.....Except for when it comes to my wife, I have never hated her so much, her presence makes my skin crawl, every time she rolls her eyes, or sighs because she has to do something or questions me for doing something (like putting cheese on hamburgers or why I was to drink a beer instead of sharing a bottle of wine with her) I can only think “fuck I hate this woman, what did I do to deserve this?!”.

2022-09-18 19:44:25,Microdosing “melts” away the trauma my body has been holding?,"To put it short and sweet, I have had a lot of body trauma in my life. I have scoliosis and car accidents exacerbated the pain. I have no curve in my neck. Over the years of constantly being in FOF (fight or flight) due to my PTSD/C-PTSD, I didn’t realize how much tension I was carrying from the trauma events. I first started hearing this when I read “The Body Keeps Score” and “C-PTSD, From Surviving to Thriving”.

 My PTSD has been getting to the point over the last year where I don’t have a day that goes by without suicidal thoughts. My partner helped me find mushrooms and set me up with a microdosing schedule. I had taken large doses in the past and found benefits. I was excited to see what microdosing could offer. 

I still have pain in my knee, my neck and my back, but I don’t know how to explain it.. it’s different. It’s the pain my body knows to be there, as “how I should and do exist”. It’s not added from the moment I wake up, ever tightening as I go through my day. I am loose. I am a noodle. I am probably how a 24 year old should feel, truthfully.. 

I recognize meditation has helped me over the past year relax to states similar, but I’ve never been able to hold it past standing up and walking away from the mat. But I now have that, in a capsule form.

I recognize I still have a long, long journey of healing. But I feel as though I have my body back for the first time in.. maybe my whole damn life. And that, my friends, is worth celebrating.

Now to stop tearing up before I go into work. Haha. Wishing you all love and happy healing.",61,1567,10,306,0
2022-02-27 21:04:18,radical rest - shrooms and capitalism don’t mix.,"since i started microdosing, i have become far happier with doing much less. maybe this is why they are still illegal;)
i live with ocd and my way of being has always been very neurotic and intense when it comes to productivity, I always feel like I have to be doing something ~ even on a rainy Sunday at home. but now, this year since I’ve started microdosing a little more frequently, I’ve noticed i am finally able to let go a little more. it almost freaks me out, how much I’ve started enjoying being a homebody, but it feels good and I’m very happy so I’m not going to overthink it. this is really helping me combat the toxic hustle culture birthed from capitalism that I’ve absorbed on my own microcosm level. i took an afternoon nap in the sunshine and it was so blissful. i also have been enjoying the art of listening to music ~ not my usual of having it play in the background while i commute or do chores, but literally laying on my back , putting in headphones and picking an album and becoming lost in it. these simple pleasures in life feel amazing.",48,1063,8,200,0
2021-03-05 02:11:23,After 6 weeks mixed shrooms/lsd,"So I've come to realize that for me, macrodosing is great for identifying problems/negative patterns, and showing me what it feels like without them. Tripping actually helped me realize I've had body dysmorphia since a child, and I've been dealing with ptsd and anxiety too.

But Microdosing is like a small daily reminder to be more positive and to do better. After a few weeks I was worried that even though I was feeling better mentally, I wasn't actually changing my habits or improving myself, but I've come to learn that's all part of the self-reflection and healing process.

Compared to six weeks ago I was still anxious about my future and plagued with insecurities which seemed to paralyze my progress. I've become more confident in my art and my body, and for the first time in a while I feel like I have a direction in life.

My point is, even if it only seems like you're making  meager progress, that tiny bit of positivity and reflection add up over time, and if you've ONLY tried microdosing a macro might be advantageous.

Have a great night :)",31,1061,5,188,0

married for 16 years. We have three kids. Now when it comes to our sex life, I've always kind of been a two-pump chump. Premature ejaculation has been a real thing. However, that first week I started microdosing I found myself being able to go 30-60 minutes without losing energy or pleasure. It was actually way better. My wife looked at me just stunned and asked where the crap did that come from.

And so here I am, two months later, and I still have the same control and lasting power. In fact, I told my wife that I felt like I actually could control when I orgasmed.

A little over 3 years ago I began working as a Project Manager, and what used to be drinking coffee every so often, turned into a full blown 7 days a week habit. Each and every morning was the same coffee, same time, same place. Flash forward to a few months ago I began microdosing psilocybin (whole mushroom) to help me see aspects of myself I was missing and/or needed to see in my daily life. Inadvertently it seemed to knock out the coffee routine. It wasn't a focus of my microdose and it wasn't something I wanted to will away actually (although I did always want to cut back). It feels like the psilocybin rewired or redirected the neural conditions in my brain that was formed from my daily coffee routine. It's now been over 2 months and the routine has not come back. To be clear I still enjoy coffee, but the three year, wake up, drink coffee, work, is gone. Figured I'd share!",49,915,8,171,0
2019-02-23 17:36:04,Some self-help and resources for people looking to improve their lives while microdosing.,"Some people that are trying microdosing for the first time to treat mood or mental health disorders, may not be aware that psychedelics work a little differently than typical Rx antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, which can sometimes numb or blunt your emotions. 

Microdosing psychedelics are more like a therapeutic tool, not a magic bullet or cure-all to fix all of your problems. Most people need to work on themselves, set their intentions, and get in the right mindset or even the right environment, to help with the positive change. Microdosing psychedelics can act more like the catalyst to help speed up the changes when combined with these things. 

Some people have found they struggle with suppressed emotions that come up or their mood and emotions can be intensified. (This may also be due to an excess of glutamate and lower levels of GABA or other factors in the brain and body. More on that later). Some people may not know how to best deal with these difficult emotions though, or not always have a therapist or someone to talk to who can help integrate what they are experiencing while microdosing. So If you need additional emotional support, would like to do some self-care or combine other therapeutic tools, here are some online resources, self-help books/audio books, and links to types of therapies and therapists that may be able to help you. 
(Also my story at the bottom, if you don’t fall asleep from this long-ass post 😁)
——

A lot of clinical studies with psychedelics, ones that are [currently being conducted](https://clinicaltrials.gov), ones that have been conducted in the past, psychedelic retreats, and underground psychedelic therapists use [psycholytic and psychedelic therapy to dive deeper to unlock the mind](https://psychedelictimes.com/psychedelic-vs-psycholytic-therapy-whats-difference/), mostly due to how malleable our minds become and how it enhances suggestibility. 

*More on that here- https://tripsafe.org/psychedelic-therapy and here is a PDF copy of [LSD Psychotherapy (1978) by Stanislav Grof, M.D.](http://simbi.kemenag.go.id/pustaka/images/materibuku/lsd%20psychotherapy.pdf) 

Edit: Results from a recent research study came out about combining mindfulness, meditation and psilocybin. [Characterization and prediction of acute and sustained response to psychedelic psilocybin in a mindfulness group retreat](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50612-3) 

You may want to find a therapist that works with psychedelic integration. Some can conduct sessions via the web or phone too!- https://psychedelic.support and https://integration.maps.org  You might also be able to find other therapists that are more open-minded about using psychedelics and microdosing. You can try https://psychologytoday.com or https://talkspace.com

Different combinations of therapeutic tools may work better or might be needed. [Different types of therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/types-of-therapy) such as CBT, ACT, NLP or EMDR may work better for certain individuals and circumstances. You may have to test the waters a little to find what works best for you. 

Journaling is also very good to do while microdosing. Lots of great journaling apps out there like Jour, Bearable, Daylio, Day One, etc.

If you’re not seeing a therapist, don’t have access to one, or maybe just don’t like them, then maybe some of these self-help books/audio books below might be your 2nd best option. Just like psychedelics, these are therapeutic tools to hopefully help improve your well-being. I feel as though the combo with some mindfulness meditation, [practicing self-care](https://www.take5tosavelives.org/practiceselfcare), therapy, (and some supplements), is what basically helped me with my mental health issues and made these positive changes in my brain even more concrete. (Personally I prefer the audio book versions because I can listen to them almost anywhere and I think my brain soaks it up quicker.)

**Disclaimer:** *Don’t worry, I’m not trying to brainwash you or anyone. You don’t have to listen or read these books. Just sharing with you what has helped me while I microdosed because microdosing alone and with my clouded messed up mind couldn’t do it alone. Also remember microdosing is not a magic bullet and everyone’s brain is unique and the psychedelics can effect you differently. There is no one-size fits all when it comes to mental health, the types of therapy or the dose you take. You need to be willing to do a little research and/or experimenting and know the *possible* risks. Microdosing might not be for everyone, especially if you have any family history of heart problems, schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms, possibly BPD, or similar undiagnosed mental illness. Please also check out the [FAQ/Wiki](https://reddit.com/r/microdosing/wiki/index) in the menu for other important info and precautions.

## Here is my story/report if you haven’t had enough reading for one day and I haven’t bored you to death yet. ;-)

Over the last ~~4 months~~ year and a half I’ve stacked the following therapeutic tools to help heal me and find real relief from my Bipolar II Depression, Anxiety, OCD and PTSD and get me out of the matrix of my mind. I started to feel real concrete results after 6 weeks. 

- Used LSD for microdosing. Did the Fadiman protocol of 1 day on, 2 days off at first and found my sweet spot by trial and error the first 2 weeks. (Unfortunately I don’t know the exact ug. It doesn’t really matter anyway because everyone is different so you’ll have to find your own sweet spot that works good for you. Also if I was to do it over again I would have tried every other day instead. The 2nd day off was rather difficult.) 
(I still haven’t tried mushrooms though, but from what I’ve read I hear they are a lot less stimulating and better for someone like me with anxiety. The LSD would sometimes trigger some anxiety or manic feelings.) 
- I started taking Magnesium L-Threonate (Magtein) + Taurate and Glycinate magnesium, 3 months after microdosing and my anxiety went away. (Both help to lower glutamate levels)
- Therapy (once or twice a month with some EMDR a couple of times)
- Mindfulness meditation once or twice a week 
- Some of the self-help audio books above
- SAM-E 200mg
- Lions Mane
- L-Theanine (Helps with GABA and modestly lowers glutamate levels)
- Vitamin B6 or a B-Complex (helps convert glutamate to GABA)
- Probiotics (Your gut health is important for proper serotonin production and glutamate balance. Lots of scientific evidence has been found about the Gut-Brain connection. Don't neglect your gut health!)
- I added in a small dose of 50mg of my Rx Lamictal as a mood stabilizer. *I had tapered off of it before starting microdosing and had to add it back it in after 3 weeks of having unstable moods.* After about 4 months I switched to 50mg in the AM and 50mg at night. After another 6 months of microdosing I finely got off those and have been feeling fine. 


These tools helped me chip away at and eliminate 95% of my Bipolar II Depression, Anxiety, PTSD and OCD. It wasn’t easy though, especially during the first month and since it was during the month of November where I had SAD. Some good days and a lot of dark days. I had to stay very mindful of my thoughts and emotions and have other emotional support mechanisms or therapeutic tools in place. Around the 3rd week I added back my Rx and SAM-E to try and help. On the 5th week I tried microdosing 3 days in a row and then every other day. That’s when things really started to shift to more positive thinking. I then took a week off and then did the every other day schedule again. That seemed to work better for me. No more depressed or suicidal thoughts, no OCD negative thought loops either. Felt more in the present moment. After about another week I went back to the Fadiman protocol then after 3 months went down to once a week. *(You have to find your sweet spot dose and a schedule that works for you. Microdosing is a personalized experiment.)*

I have found that these problems are all related to some type of [disconnect in the brain](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/c4vdn6/scientists_have_discovered_that_a_mysterious/) and [glutamate/GABA balance](https://nourishedblessings.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2cc4b449-5610-4b75-bd3e-daf2ac9c2294-7.png), and deeper in the psyche and “ego”, the false mind-made self; past conditioning or basically bad programming/wiring of the brain, and suppressed/repressed emotions that are kept trapped in our bodies and minds as a negative energy.

I believe the neuroplasticity that psychedelics have shown to produce had started creating these new neural pathways and get better connected to my body, which allowed me to break out of those negative habits/patterns, helped rewire my brain, jump-start my serotonin receptors, be more self-aware and conscious of my thoughts and emotions (boosted my emotional intelligence) and stay in the present moment, “in the now”. I let go or “surrendered” the pain, negative energy and garbage that were collected by my ego and body all these years. I became more compassionate, loving and empathetic. I went up the levels of consciousness to courage, acceptance, love, and peace. Basically I became a positive version of me and most importantly a better more loving parent and husband! 

Microdosing has been able to do what no other prescription medicine, mindfulness or therapy *alone* were able to do for the last 20 years!
I hope others may experience the same levels of positivity and that microdosing can help heal you too! ❤️ Don’t get discouraged or lose hope if you don’t feel these things right away. It may take time. Be patient and keep swimming, you’re almost there!

2021-10-08 11:11:56,"Switching to LSD, wow!","Just started LSD microdosing yesterday,  instead of mushrooms that I've MD'd on and off over the last year. My main problem is procrastination, inability to stay on task, being quite scatterbrained and lacking motivation and drive. This has caused more and more serious problems for me over the years, leading to downstream anxiety and depression from feeling hopelessly incompatible with the demands of the outside world. 

I would definitely say I have some signs of inattentive ADD, although my psychiatrist friend (who is not my psychiatrist) thinks I show more autistic traits. I have been compensating somewhat with above average intelligence, but this feeling of never living up to ones potential is seriously painful. 

Psilo MD'ing has been utterly amazing for depression, but ultimately it has not really helped me much to steer my life in the right direction. Just started on LSD yesterday and whoa, what a completely different animal it is, not really what I was expecting, but potentially even better than I hoped for! Very excited to see how it pans out these next weeks. Will follow Fadiman protocol or close to it.

I would appreciate any advice on complementing supplements and practices to make this as sustainable as possible. As I mentioned, I am a bit challenged as far as general energy, so the stimulating nature of LSD is a great fit for me. Of course there's no such thing as a free lunch so I will be most respectful of my need to rest and recover. Adressing sleep, workout and nutrition the best I can for now (have some blood sugar issues, suspect leaky gut and candida overgrowth).",22,1610,4,273,0

2019-05-08 04:39:05,I created the MD tracking app I always wanted and now I released it for free!,"What's good y'all.

I wanted to bring some light to the sub and supply you guys with a tool that can improve harm reduction as well as help with your microdosing schedule!

As many of you do, I used to keep notes of my substance use in my phone. I had tried looking for apps that would track all of my information in a good looking interface with a focus on privacy, but everything was either stored online or not geared towards what I wanted.

I knew a little bit of coding (but not much) and figured I would start a side project in my free time. A month later, here I am. I've created Tablets, a mobile app that looks great and works flawlessly. Everything is stored locally on my device (for a focus on privacy) and is straight forward (includes substance classifications, unlike all common journaling substitutes). Data can be viewed in many ways including custom filters, and can be exported/backed up to a spreadsheet or deleted at any time. I've been using the beta version for the last month and it's worked great. 

Some filters you could use are average dose, average time between doses (for when to spread out your MDs a bit more), and our calendar indicator to see when you're taking what.

It's free, no ads, no profits. No servers to upkeep, all stored on phone. I made it for myself and my friends but want everyone to be able to enjoy it. I'll add features in updates as I think of them or hear feedback.

I was very excited to start. We have a friend that can get this kind of thing, and he kindly got me some a few weeks ago. We met up yesterday (a family get together, not just for this) and it turns out no mushrooms for me, because his elderly dad decided this was also a great idea and has been using them himself .... apparently it's took 30s years off him and he feels amazing.

2020-01-10 20:07:22,Almost 2 Months MDing Cubensis,"My whole brain feels so amazing I can’t believe these kind of changes happened, and I feel like I’m growing more and more into the healthiest and most positive mind set I can imagine. I follow Paul Stamets 4 days on 3 days off. I stack it with 100mg flushing niacin, .2 g local Oregon cubensis mushrooms (I went the first month at 
.1g I’ve found that my sweet spot at .2g and I don’t plan on upping this dose any further. This is because even if my tolerance goes up to this amount they still seem to do what I want it to do regardless of some tolerance to what seems like more just the sensory aspects, less the mind aspects, so I wonder what would be the point), and .1g Lions Mane (Host Defense).

I could go on forever about the positive changes to my life. My creative projects exploded this past month and a half, I’ve started to make month long routines of this for all my friends just like I’m doing, and I’m totally sticking with my old forgotten workout habits which now feel extremely fun and easy. Other changes: I’m less of a binger of anything really that was bad for me like too much food in general, too much bad foods, I’m not really spending countless hours procrastinating, I’m not leaving cleaning for tomorrow really, my friends all keep complementing my attitude and drive, and my dating life is blossoming.

I feel like I’ve finally found this headspace with this that is of a higher vibration of positivity and it actually feels like my brain is rewiring itself in a good way. I note that because I spent almost two weeks off and continued healthy headspace thinking almost the same until the end of the two weeks, then I jumped right back in the wagon upping my dose to .2 from .1. Boom!! Had one of the best days of my life that day, and now it’s getting even easier to enjoy this new headspace.

It is ALSO maaajorly noteworthy that I have the best memory I’ve ever had in my life like honestly 5x better, I can focus like I’ve never been able to for countless hours on things I couldn’t before, and I do not consider touching Adderall I was always jumping to for motivation and projects (I’m not pro-Adderall for a number of reasons).

1. I’m much more productive at work. I’ve been able to tackle complex problems I previously couldn’t figure out on my MD days. And the days go by SO fast, it feels like I barely worked. 
2. I appreciate nature more. When I walk outside, I stop for a second and think about how beautiful the world is. 
3. I understand music I didn’t understand before. 
4. I have made more progress in therapy (specifically EMDR) this month than I’ve made in the past three years. 
5. I believe in myself more. I find myself flipping negative emotions/thoughts around and turning them into positives. And now more than ever, I’m motivated to pursue my dreams. 
6. I’m much more balanced and in tune with my body in yoga. 
7. I understand meditation and consciousness better now. I had a breakthrough while meditating on a trip dose, and I find that meditating on a MD helps me tap back into that mind space. 
8. I’m more present in everyday life. I can’t explain it. I’m nowhere else but here, now.
9. I’m more compassionate. This can be a good thing or a bad thing. It’s kicked me in the ass a few times. 

So far, zero negatives. The only time I wasn’t too sure is when I took my first 15ug dose. I’ve found that 10ug isn’t quite enough and 15ug is a bit too much, so I think 12-13ug is my sweet spot. 

I’m definitely going to continue! Has anyone else experimented with other dose schedules?",29,1519,4,282,0

She’s been reading a lot about it and has other patients who’ve tried it with positive results. She even gave me dose recommendations and recommended taking it in the mornings, as it can either get canceled out by the Xanax, or cause additional anxiety, if the two interact poorly together. She also has been fascinated to hear how the experience is impacting my mental wellbeing and has offered to be a guide for me (in as much as is legally allowed). 

Fortunately, I live in a state where it is legal to grow and freeze mushrooms, it’s just not legal to dry and sell them. So regardless of how I’ve acquired them, I just say I’m growing the, so that she’s not in any legal gray zone for me to talk about it. 

Then today I was talking to my prescribing provider (for the prescriptions mentioned above), and told her I was interested in trying it.

Start with a lower dose (and alternative possibilities)","[r/microdosing Disclaimer](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/m2g589/rmicrodosing_disclaimer/)

\[Updated: Oct 4, 2021: Added connection between anger and higher levels of adrenaline| Post title in old format as many useful user insights in the comments\]

# Body Load

* When macrodosing it is common to feel negative 'come-up' symptoms until you essentially 'breakthrough' to the next level or also known as [body load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_load):

>Generally, body load is an unpleasant physical sensation that is  difficult to describe objectively either in terms of other sensations or  in its specific location. However, it could be likened to an instinct  of the body sensing it is about to be placed under exceptional stress, a  state of pre-shock. Common symptoms include stomach ache, nausea,  dizziness, feelings of being over-stimulated or ""wired,"" shivering,  feelings of excessive tension in the torso, or, in more severe cases,  shortness of breath or a feeling of suffocation.

* So it could be the case that you have taken too much of a microdose and too little to macrodose and you are now in a level somewhere in between/limbo and entered the [Twilight Zone](https://youtu.be/ORbseYAkzRM).
* If this is the case, then it is best to take a break (in case you have built up some [tolerance](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/s4qh9d/faqtip_020_what_causes_tolerance_desensitization/)) and [start again with a lower dose](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/s0xkdp/the_new_official_rmicrodosing_starters_guide/) and [titrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_titration) the dosage.
* Also you should start looking at dosage from the perspective of how much your body needs to achieve some kind of balance/[homeostasis](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/ry3683/eli5_homeostasis_and_negativepositive_feedback/) (rather than a predetermined dosage) akin to a car with maybe half-a-tank of fuel left. You need find the right amount so you do not overflow.

## Causes

* Also from the body load link:

>The causes of the experience of body load are unknown. However, one proposed mechanism is the stimulation of serotonergic 5-HT receptors,^(\[1\]\[2\]) particularly those involved in tactile sensation and, equally importantly in many cases where [nausea](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/mzkfcx/faqtip_002_have_nausea_or_an_upset_stomach_then/) is experienced, those located along the lining of the digestive tract. Serotonin is heavily involved in appetite control, and over-stimulation of serotonergic receptors has been shown to cause nausea in overdoses of SSRIs or MDMA. Many psychedelics which can cause body load are partial serotonin agonists, which work by mimicking the structure of serotonin to varying degrees.

# Alternative cause: Adrenaline/Epinephrine Rush

>In contrast, many drug users, and particularly users of cannabis, entactogens like MDMA or of certain synthetic phenethylamines (most notably the popular 2C-B) and tryptamines,  also often report a ""body high"" or ""body rush"", which is similar to  body load in many respects but is usually considered pleasant.

* This sounds similar to [adrenaline rush](https://www.healthline.com/health/adrenaline-rush) symptoms due to an overactive [sympathetic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system#/media/File:The_Autonomic_Nervous_System.jpg)\* (*fight-flight-freeze* response) via the [dopamine pathway](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna-Vegh-3/publication/308037816/figure/fig3/AS:460152101969923@1486720218700/Pathway-of-catecholamine-biosynthesis-Synthesis-of-epinephrine-and-norepinephrine-is.png) (According to [Dr. Andrew Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/), epinephrine is produced in the brain and adrenaline in the body). \*Check the graphic below for associated signs like dilated pupils or loss of appetite. Trying to instigate the parasympathetic nervous system (*rest-and-digest* response) can help.

>Those experiencing `rage` usually feel the effects of **high adrenaline levels** in the body. This increase in adrenal output ***raises the physical strength and endurance levels*** of the person and sharpens their senses, while ***dulling the sensation of pain***. High levels of adrenaline ***impair memory***. Temporal perspective is also affected: people in a rage have described ***experiencing events in slow-motion***.[^(\[2\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(emotion)#Symptoms_and_effects)

* One other possible indication that your adrenaline levels are too high is ***increased body odor***: [Why does stress sweat smell different?](https://www.healthline.com/health/stress-sweat#odor). Confirmed by some redditors, friends IRL and myself when I took a higher microdose.
* If this is the case, you may be able to mitigate these symptoms with [breathwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronsToNirvana/?f=flair_name%3A%22Take%20A%20Breather%20%F0%9F%8C%AC%22&restrict_sr=1) or the [Wim Hof method](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronsToNirvana/search/?q=wim%20hof&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=)([**cold exposure**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronsToNirvana/search/?q=cold%20AND%20(water%20OR%20exposure%20OR%20altered%20OR%20shower)&restrict_sr=1)) or a hot bath/shower/sauna or cardio (to sweat 😅 out the excess adrenaline): See the [short clips](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/mzj6o3/faqtip_001_tools_for_managing_stress_anxiety/gw109up?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of FAQ/Tip 001 on how to reduce stress in real-time and details of the 'physiological sigh'.

# Conjecture

* Also some of the symptoms sounds like most of your serotonin receptors have been half-asleep or dormant and suddenly they wake up all at once, so it takes time for the body to adjust. I have read if you are severely magnesium deficient then taking too high of a magnesium dose  can also put the body into a state of pre-shock  (akin to putting motor racing fuel into your little car), so it is advised to gradually increase the dosage. *More discussion with some evidence-based research in a future FAQ about serotonin - more a neuromodulator than neurotransmtter.*

2020-09-10 22:35:52,PTSD and microdosing,"I been microdosing for a month now. Before, I was suffering from severe depression, suicidal thoughts, intrusive thoughts, compulsions, fear, OCD episodes, anxiety panics, nightmares, and unknowingly had undiagnosed PTSD since a child. 

I had supressed my emotions entirely for so long, there was a separateness from myself and feeling any type of emotion. Good or bad. However, two emotions I had no problem I could never fight away was anger and fear. 
I had been on 8 different medications from my psychiatrist for years. Only difference I saw was my anxiety was controlled by pills rather than anything else. 
Now currently microdosing one month in, I feel everything. My anxiety and depression has dramatically decreased. A mind of someone who has OCD is anything but clear. However it was the clearest I ever felt in a very long time. I can actually feel. 
In the beginning of microdosing “my emotions,” I didn’t feel so disconnected. I could feel everything. Happy, excitement, sad, pleasant, euphoric, even my 5 senses were better. I could hear and taste much better. I actually enjoyed my meals and the day to day events.

Since I’m new to emotions I been crying a lot. I’m crying through movies. I’m crying through shows like “Shameless,” when the characters are acting out their traumas, and going through destructive paths. My husband will look over at me and I’m crying like a baby. I see a movie on racism and abuse, I suddenly feel this anger that turns into another crying episode. 
 It sounds like a horrible time which it feels like at the moment but its not, because it’s so necessary. I no longer wanted the feelings to be gone with a swallow, puff, or drink. I wanted to feel it and process them. 

For the longest I was disconnected from my emotions so much I wasn’t enjoying anything genuinely. I didn’t feel anything when I got married, pregnant, deaths, etc... I liked my life but I didn’t feel connected to it. I never made time to accept my past memories and my emotions. So they never came. I felt that was the only way I could get through life. 
I worked over 60+ hours for that simple reason. It kept me away from my past hurt in my life but also didn’t let me enjoy the good in my life now. My own son each day would ask me are you happy momma. I would always answer with yes because I certainly wasn’t sad but he knew I just wasn’t happy either. 
The biggest difference besides my emotions connecting back to me so I have an opportunity to be able to process them, I was having flashbacks. I was having a lot of them from the child abuse I’ve suppressed and completely forgotten in my 20s and 30s. 
My memory was getting mush 😉 better which means my wounds were now resurfacing. I’m even shocked that I’m remembering things so vividly and can’t believe what happened to me, after remembering everything. Im also remembering my emotions at that time. Overall, I was never safe and always in fear.

However the home I have now and the family I have created has been safe. Im not waking up to fear and blood anymore. I’m sharing compassion for myself when I never had that for myself for the last 30+ years. 
I’m now making myself aware that I’m in a safe place away from the unsafe place as a kid on a daily basis. I now feel like I’m living. I can actually say I’m happy and mean it. My family(husband and 7 year old son) is enjoying the change. 
I also know I have so much more work ahead of me and emotions to process but I’m happy that I’m no longer living in fear. Thank you for reading. I hope everyone is feeling lighter! 🙏",20,3561,3,649,0

Wasn't terrible but wasn't great either. I love microdosing but not when you're at the dentist. 

Also my mouths numb AF",23,358,4,65,0
2019-10-21 22:26:10,I think microdosing helped me figure out I don't want to go to medical school,"Hi all,

So I've been microdosing for a couple of weeks now. It's pretty remarkable how quiet it is inside of my head compared to what it used to be. That default network is very, very quiet. Anxiety, fear, abuse, compulsive planning... it's all sort of faded away recently. And I think it's this silence that helped me hear what I've known for a long time: I don't want to be a doctor.

I've been jumping through all the hoops necessary to go to medical school-- graduated with perfect grades last year, and was all set to practice for the MCAT these next few months. But I've been so miserable. Opening these textbooks feels like pulling teeth. I'm at war with my body and myself. 

But I've persisted: my parents are doctors, my sister is in medical school right now. It's good money. It's prestigious. It's secure.

But a couple of nights ago, I wrote down what I don't need:

Wealth.
Power.
Fame.
Prestige.
Fear.
Authority.

Take way these things, and do I still want to be a doctor? Do I still want to subject myself to all training and expenses it entails? And the answer came back, finally: no.

I'm not sure what I want to do. I have a few ideas. Right now I'm just trying to enjoy the uncertainty. I'm always trying to control. 

I think I've always wanted to be an artist of some sort. I'm 30 and just realizing that. I don't know if I can make a career out of it. I've done some film work. But whatever I choose, medical school feels so all-consuming, I don't think I can sufficiently tend to that part of myself while trying to be a physician. I look at the next 8 years ahead and I see torture. It might be for some people, but it's not for me. And that's okay. I'm not a failure (thanks, default mode! thanks, depression!). I'm just here to do something different.",77,1779,15,331,0
2023-02-05 00:50:27,Microdosing psilocybin has changed my life for the better,"Hey everyone, I’m a 29 yo male from Australia and have had serious ongoing mental health issues for most of my adult life; bpd, depression, addiction, anxiety, and had gotten to a point where I was losing hope that anything could help me or fix me. Had tried all the conventional methods, therapy, antidepressants etc but nothing made a lasting impact.

 I had wanted to try microdosing for a while since learning about all the positive reports but I finally decided I was going to do it around 3 weeks ago and I am a completely different person since. 

I feel so much happier, I am so motivated, I have no urges for the addictions which were previously so strong, I’m eating healthier, my relationships are improving, I’m going to the gym regularly. Everything just feels so much easier, lighter, and overall just manageable. 

All I ever wanted was to feel an overall sense of normalcy and feel like my day to day life is manageable and I can honestly say for the first time possibly ever that I have felt all these things consistently these past 3 weeks. 

Anyway I guess I just wanted to share my story as I’m feeling so good and just wanted to say if you are feeling similarly to me and feeling like there’s no more hope, that there definitely is.",57,1253,9,227,0
2021-04-16 18:22:12,Day 1 microdosing experience [psilocybin],"So I’ve been pretty interested in microdosing for a while now, hearing how it has positively impacted people suffering from anxiety and/or depression I decided to see what it was all about.

Took my dose of 0.2g GT with my breakfast at around 8:00am hopped in the shower and started my day. About an hour and a half into my morning I stepped outside to take out the trash and noticed things looked a little crisper, almost like I had put on HD goggles or something (nothing trippy just a touch more detailed and the colors seemed to pop a little more). I felt a faint nudge of encouragement to go ahead and do the daily tasks that I had planned rather than put them off like I do a lot of the time. As I cleaned up around the house and worked on my projects I found myself in a very positive headspace and just generally happy (like the feeling you get when you reminisce on a memory that makes you smile). 

11:30am - by this time I’d cleaned almost my entire house and decided it was about time to go grab some lunch and got caught up in some traffic, which surprisingly didn’t bother me at all, just kinda had a sense of positivity and an un-rushed appreciation for the present moment.

I wish I had more events to report but I intentionally chose a day that I didn’t have much going on to start dosing, but, the rest of the day basically followed this same theme of positivity, clearheaded energy with a sense of a little more initiative to go ahead and do those things that needed to be done. I also noticed I didn’t experience my normal afternoon crash and decided to skip my routine afternoon cup of coffee. 

All in all I’m calling today a win: Encouragement, Positivity, Focus, Clearheadedness, Initiative, and Appreciation for the present moment are all the things I noticed today and I’m excited to continue and see where this goes.",41,1843,5,339,0
2021-06-27 18:20:56,Two months into MDing - my results,"Hello all! I am checking in here after 80 days of microdosing - so really almost 3 months - and I just wanted to share the effects it has had on my life. I’ll try not to ramble, but I need to explain how I felt before MDing so you can really understand what’s happened.
 
Since I was about 10 years old, I have been in a state of depression. It’s gotten worse as I got older, but I never realized it was a problem because it was constant my entire life. There’s always a voice behind my internal monologue constantly telling me I have no value, that my failed relationships are my fault, and that I am a terrible person. Some of you may be able to relate. It was so persistent that I thought *everyone* felt this way, and I never so much as thought to mention it out loud.
 
So I start microdosing. And within 2 days that voice is gone. Not quieted, not lessened, completely gone.
 
It’s worth noting that the mushrooms don’t make me happy. I still get frustrated, sad, disappointed, but I am able to handle those emotions as they come, whereas before they would dominate my day. In the past 80 days, I have maybe had a single day that I would call “bad” when it was over. Otherwise I am now able to more clearly see what’s important and what’s not.
 
I don’t know if these are typical results, but it has genuinely changed my life. Thank you, people of this sub, for helping me get started.
 
As a side note, I took my first heroic dose yesterday after 2 weeks resetting my tolerance, and the benefits of MDing didn’t go away while I wasn’t taking anything. It diminished slightly towards the end of last week, but I was still feeling healthy and happy.
 
I hope this is helpful to someone in some way. I appreciate you all.",34,1725,7,326,0
2022-04-08 15:14:13,Microdosing Guide (psilocybin),"**What is Microdosing?**

Microdosing involves taking a minuscule dose of a psychedelic substance, usually 5-10% of a regular dose, with the intention of increasing the quality of your life. With microdosing you do not experience a classic psychedelic trip, including visual disturbances, but only perceive subtle effects sometimes called ""sub-perceptual"" effects. Microdosing gives the best results when done over a longer period of time and you follow a dosing schedule, or protocol. The effects and results of a microdosing cycle depend greatly on the person, the substance, the dosage, and a host of other personal factors such as intention, expectations, and mindset.

The subtle effects of microdosing that are most often mentioned:

* More energy
* More creativity
* Brighter thinking,
* Increased problem solving ability
* Increased focus
* Increased awareness
* Positive mood
* Emotional connection with people around you
* Being more present

To date, much scientific research is still needed to understand the effects of psychedelics and microdosing in particular. Although some claim that microdosing is nothing more than a placebo effect, a large amount of anecdotal evidence clearly shows that microdosing leads to physical, mental and emotional improvement. Dr. James Fadiman, an American transpersonal psychologist, has been collecting reports from people around the world since 2010 that form an overwhelming picture with positive experiences.

What we do know is that psychedelic substances act on the serotonin (5-HT) receptors in our brains. Serotonin receptors are found throughout our nervous system and regulate many aspects of our existence, including our mood, our thinking and our bowel movements. Psychedelics bind most effectively to the 5HT-2 receptor, which is one of the receptors involved in learning, memory and cognition. Using only a small amount of psychedelics and avoiding the ""classic trip"" allows the brain to focus solely on the cognitive boost caused by these receptors.

&#x200B;

**Benefits of Microdosing**

People microdose for many different reasons, ranging from increased productivity and creativity to reducing pain or specific medical complaints. 

Microdosing is not a panacea, but a tool you can use to accelerate your awareness, maximize your healing, and take charge of your own life. Furthermore, because psychedelics are so-called ""non-specific mental enhancers,"" the benefits reported below will not always apply to everyone or with all microdosing substances. Some benefits of microdosing are now being scientifically investigated, in all cases microdosing is a tool but certainly not a solution to all your problems. Ultimately, you are the one who must actively integrate the insights into your life.

**What are the (mental) benefits of microdosing?**

* Improved concentration and focus-especially with ADHD
* Getting into the flow of work, hobby, or study faster
* Increased creativity
* Increased productivity
* Improved problem-solving ability
* Improved general awareness
* Improved mood
* More balanced mood
* Improved decision-making ability
* Making more conscious choices about health, lifestyle, well-being
* More positive mindset
* Increased emotional awareness
* More emotional connection with people around you
* More presence
* More openness
* Decrease in depression (in a range from mild symptoms to clinical depression)
* Less procrastination
* Increased sense of wonder
* Increased sense of belonging
* Increased sense of unity
* Increased connection to spirituality and/or life mission
* Increased gratitude for life

**Physical (bodily) benefits of microdosing**

* Improved sleep
* Increased physical energy
* Improved sensory perception
* Less premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
* Less stuttering
* Support for quitting smoking and other addictions

&#x200B;

**Medical applications of microdosing**

In addition to the many benefits to general well-being, positive medical applications of microdosing have also been reported. Depression, ADHD and cluster headaches are perhaps the most significant of these. In Dr. James Fadiman's study, the most positively satisfying results were reported for the following symptoms/conditions:

* Depression
* ADHD and ADD
* Cluster headaches
* Migraine headaches
* Obsessive-compulsive disorder
* Eating Disorder
* Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
* Hair loss
* Addictions
* Recovery from stroke
* Allergies
* Social anxiety
* Burnout
* Pain experience
* Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
* Hormonal disruptions (menopause, PMDD)

This is anecdotal evidence. Clinical studies of the medicinal effects of microdosing in patient groups (randomized double-blind with a control group) are essential to obtain accurate data.

**Microdosing and depression**

Depression is a mood disorder that can be described as a feeling of persistent sadness with a loss of joy in life. Several participants in Dr. James Fadiman's study reported that microdosing relieved their depression. In addition, a study by Toby Lea, Ph.D., clearly showed that many people benefit from microdosing to combat their depression.

A person with Parkinson's disease described that after one month of LSD microdosing, his Parkinson's symptoms did not improve, but his underlying depression did. However, Fadiman emphasizes that his subjects' data is based on only one month of microdosing. It has not been shown whether microdosing can alleviate depression in the long term; thus, this needs further investigation.

**Microdosing and cluster headaches**

Microdosing appears promising to be used medically for cluster headaches, which are often described as excruciating headaches that feel more intense than, say, childbirth or kidney stones. In his research, James Fadiman cites a patient who managed to get rid of her ""ice pick headache"" by microdosing LSD. She was able to achieve the same result several times over the following months. Since then, her cluster headaches have stayed away.

However, Clusterbusters, a platform for cluster headache sufferers, is taking the lead in researching psychedelics as a possible treatment. While all other treatments have been unsuccessful, many patients (\~80%) have found significant relief from their cluster headaches through LSD, 1cP-LSD, magic truffles, or magic mushrooms. The doses were generally a little too large to be considered microdoses, but there is ample evidence that microdoses can also be effective.

Fortunately, scientific research on microdosing for the treatment of cluster headaches is starting in the US and Canada. The expectation is that with this the effectiveness of (microdosing of) psychedelics as a remedy for this terrible condition can be definitively demonstrated.

**Microdosing and ADHD/ADD**

Because microdosing psychedelics can have a positive impact on one's concentration, it could be a suitable replacement for ADHD drugs and other pharmaceutical cognitive enhancers. A participant in Fadiman's study reported that microdosing helped him to wean off his use of Adderall. Adderall is a notoriously addictive ADHD medication that, like Ritalin, is also used by students to study through the night.

*""Adderall is nothing more than the amphetamine (speed) sold on the streets and nightlife. So the drugs that are bad for your brain and whose possession is illegal are the same drugs we give to hundreds of thousands of children every morning.""* \- Carl Hart Ph.D., professor of biochemistry at Columbia University

&#x200B;

**The Fadiman Protocol**

Dr. James Fadiman is known as the ""father of modern microdosing"" because of his pioneering work and scientific studies on microdosing. He has been collecting anecdotal reports from thousands of people who have tried microdosing since 2010. The reports revealed how they overcame their insecurities, anxiety, depression and stress, as well as migraines, cluster headaches, and PMS and hormonal symptoms. Dr. James Fadiman has since been convinced that microdosing can have tremendous psychological and health benefits, while having virtually no risks.

Following the growing interest in microdosing, Fadiman was also the first to develop a standard microdosing protocol so that people could safely and purposefully experiment with microdosing, keeping track of their observations and documenting their own well-being over the course of a month.

In addition to following this protocol, he believes it is very effective to keep a daily journal. This allows you to reflect on your days where you become specifically aware of changes in your mood, productivity, creativity, energy and social relationships. By becoming aware of the effect of microdosing on your daily functioning, you have a strong guide for integrating the insights gained into your life.

Fadiman has concluded from his observations and numerous anecdotal accounts that with microdosing, information seems to travel better through the body. It seems to put the wrong connections back in the right place. ""Maybe it's in your central nervous system, in your brain stem, or maybe it improves the function of mitochondria. We have no idea so far how it really works."" What microdosing seems to do is bring people (back) into balance. They improve their relationship with their bodies and become more attuned to their needs. For example, people say they create better patterns, such as sleeping better, eating healthier, and no longer being in the grip of cravings or addictions.

There are theories from neuroscience about how microdosing works, but so far there has been no clinical research. However, Fadiman believes that his field research provides strong evidence for the benefits of microdosing. For him, more than 1850 reports of individual experiences worldwide are proof that there is more to it than just a placebo effect.

**The Method of the Fadiman Protocol**

Fadiman's protocol is based on a 3-day cycle, which you follow for 8 to 10 weeks. This involves taking a microdose in the morning or early afternoon on day 1, followed by no microdose for 2 days.

* DAY 1: Microdosing day
* DAY 2: Transition day (do not microdose)
* DAY 3: Normal day (do not microdose)
* DAY 4: Microdosing day
* After that: Continue cycle for 1 or 2 months

&#x200B;

**The Stamets Stack**

Stamets Stack has quickly gained popularity in the microdosing community. Renowned mycologist Paul Stamets first talked about ""stacking,"" combining several non-psychoactive substances with a psychoactive microdosing substance to increase the positive effect related to microdosing. He invented (and patented) the Lion's Mane stacking method. This microdosing stacking method, often called the Stamets' Stack, combines the medicinal mushroom Lion's Mane with the vitamin niacin and psilocybin.

**Lion's Mane**

Stamets came up with the combination of psilocybin mushrooms and Lion's Mane because of its dual capacity to 1) create new nerve cells and neural pathways in the brain, and also 2) repair existing neurological damage.

The evidence comes from two laboratory studies in which the scientists intentionally damaged the brains of mice by introducing a neurotoxin. They observed the behavior of the mice and noted that they exhibited dementia-like symptoms. After administration of Lion's Mane, the effects of the neurotoxin appeared to be restored.

Lion's mane, also known as wigweed, bearded tooth mushroom or hedgehog mushroom, is a medicinal mushroom native to North America, Europe and Asia. Medicinal mushrooms are getting a lot of attention these days, but Lion's Mane has drawn particular attention for its special nerve-regenerating properties. In Chinese and Japanese culture, use of Lion's Mane goes back hundreds of years.

Lion's Mane stimulates the brain to produce more NGF (Nerve Growth Factors). These are responsible for the production, growth and maintenance of neurons in the brain. NGF is specifically responsible for the creation of myelin sheaths, a protective layer around brain cells that increases the conduction of stimuli between cells and. Unfortunately, these sheaths can become damaged as we age, and the speed of conduction becomes much slower, leading to the decline of brain functions (such as in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). In other words, Lion's Mane helps keep the brain vital and healthy.

In addition, Lion's Mane contains antioxidants that support the overall health of cells. These are responsible for the transport of energy. The formula is simple: healthier cells, better energy transport, more energy.

The reported benefits of Lion's Mane are as follows:

* Improves memory
* Increases alertness
* Increases concentration
* Anti-inflammatory
* Supports intestinal health
* Improves mood
* Increases energy level
* Supports insulin sensitivity
* Can help with PTSD
* Regeneration of vision neurons
* Regeneration of auditory neurons

**Niacin**

Stamets reports that most of the neurogenerative action takes place in the nerve endings; therefore, since niacin acts as a flushing agent that transports the molecules of the other two stacking substances through the blood-brain barrier, it helps in the distribution of these important molecules. In other words, it ensures that as much of active substance as possible gets to the right place; namely, our brain.

Niacin (nicotinic acid), also known as vitamin B3 or vitamin PP, is a vitamin produced in the body from the amino acid tryptophan. It is obtained in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods (labeled as E375). Although the names are similar, nicotinic acid has nothing to do with nicotine in tobacco. To avoid confusion, nicotinic acid is usually referred to as niacin.

Niacin plays a vital role in energy and protein metabolism. Without this vitamin, proper metabolism such as the synthesis of proteins, fats and carbohydrates cannot exist. Niacin has an antioxidant effect and participates in many enzymatic processes. It is essential for the regeneration of the skin, muscles, nerves and DNA.

**When is the intake of niacin not recommended**

* Hypersensitivity to vitamin B3
* Liver diseases
* Ulcerus pepticum (ulcer of stomach and/or duodenum)
* Gout
* Alcoholism
* Very low blood pressure
* Decreased renal function

In a dose-dependent manner, niacin induces insulin resistance and lowers glucose tolerance. In people without diabetes, blood glucose levels remain normal; in diabetics, a maximum dose of 1.5 grams of niacin per day is recommended (at this dose, the effect on blood glucose levels is minimal).

With an intake of more than 50 milligrams of niacin, a ""niacin flush"" may occur with redness of the face, arms, and chest (sometimes with minor swelling of the skin) and a burning, stinging, and/or itching sensation, as well as headache. These symptoms last an average of 30 minutes to an hour. This reaction can be severe, but it is not an allergic reaction. It is harmless and lasts only a few minutes. By gradually increasing the amount and combining niacin with a vitamin B complex and vitamin C, this flush can be prevented. Do not take more than 500 milligrams of niacin per day.

For the Stamets Stack, it is also possible to omit the niacin and only microdose along with Lion's Mane. There are many people who find the niacin unnecessary, get enough vitamin B3 from their diet or find the effects of a niacin flush unpleasant. Stamets' described effect where the niacin helps transport the Lion's Mane and the psilocybin to the tip of the nerve is also questioned by some people.

**Stacking**

At the microdosing level, psilocybin has a sub-perceptual effect. Within that barely perceptible effect, it has the potential to reduce anxiety and irritability, improve cognitive functions and creativity, become more social, provide a greater overall sense of well-being, and reduce the effects of aging. The Stamets Stack can also promote self-awareness, general well-being, and a sense of connection to all that lives. 

**The method of the Stamets Stack**

The Stamets Stack is based on microdosing on 4 to 5 consecutive days and then not microdosing for 3 to 2 days so that any accumulated tolerance is reset. In all situations the use of niacin is optional (and perhaps should be discouraged for diabetics).

* DAY 1-4 (microdosing days)

1. 1-3 milligrams of psilocybin (0.1g shrooms or 0.5-1.0g Magic Truffles)
2. 500mg to 1000mg of Lion's Mane powder extract or capsules.
3. 75-200mg of niacin Vit B3 'Flush'.

* DAY 5-7 (normal rest days)

1. Optional: daily amount of Lion's Mane powder extract
2. 50-200 milligrams of niacin

* CYCLUSION: continue for four weeks
* RESET: two to four weeks

&#x200B;

**Before You Begin**

Start microdosing on a day off. Microdosing may be a little too high at first. This may feel uncomfortable or new during your daily activities.

If you take the microdose in the morning, it will be a lot heavier if you take it on an empty stomach. It is recommended to eat a light breakfast first.

Psilocybin is a stimulant. However, some people may feel tired. This is usually due to the physical realization that the body is out of shape and carrying a lot of tension and when you notice this you will feel the need to relax deeply. Yoga and meditation while using a microdose is experienced as very nice by many people.

Because psilocybin is a stimulant it can actually give you energy. When you take it together with coffee you stack stimulants. Sometimes this is experienced as pleasant but there are also people who cannot appreciate this. This is entirely an individual preference. It could be that this makes you more productive, but it can also lead to loss of concentration (just like drinking too much coffee).

Take a single microdose in the morning. After about 30 to 60 minutes you will be able to feel its effects. The direct effects such as creativity and improved mood last about 4-5 hours. The indirect effects such as calmness and empathy persist throughout the next day.

The microdose should be sub-perceptual, meaning that you shouldn't really feel anything from the microdose. However, if you do feel something and it affects your concentration then it is nice to take a break and go for a walk in nature for example.

The use of any substance that affects your consciousness (including drugs) can affect your ability to react, therefore it is not recommended to drive a car or operate heavy machinery in the 4-5 hours after you have taken the microdose or until you are more familiar with the effects of the microdose. A good measure to explore this for yourself is to take 2 microdoses and see what effect it has on your cognition.

If you microdose too often (every day), the body builds up tolerance, which means you have to take more to achieve the same effect. This is not scientifically confirmed but is generally known. Because of this tolerance it is advisable to include rest days in your protocol as is done in the Fadiman Protocol (1 day on, 2 days off) or the Stamets Stack (4 days on, 3 days off).

Describe your experiences in a journal. What works well is to have an intention when microdosing. Because you are focusing on this you are mentally programming yourself to achieve a result, the neuronal plasticity that microdosing stimulates helps greatly with this.

Microdosing is best followed as a course of treatment. Take the microdoses for 8 to 10 weeks and stick to the fixed days on which you dose. After this period, it is best to stop for a while to reevaluate how you feel and get back to your baseline. Some most people resume their microdosing regime after a month in the same manner, some just microdose after this period when it is convenient for them and don't stick to a schedule as much, again others stop microdosing altogether or pick it up again a few months later for a cure. 

&#x200B;

**Risks and Side Effects of Microdosing**

Dr. James Fadiman and Sophia Korb received more than 1,800 reports from 59 countries about the experience of microdosing. There were only 75 people who claimed to have no positive experience when microdosing. Based on this, they are convinced that they can establish a provisional starting point for the risk of microdosing; it is safe. First, because the dosage is so low, there seems to be no danger of a ""bad trip,"" psychosis, or other acute experiences-positive or negative-that a full psychedelic trip might entail. Among the collected responses from microdosers, there was not a single case of psychosis.

In a small percentage of people reporting that they suffered from a lot of anxiety or were predisposed to it, some told us that they felt good when microdosing, but that they felt depressed again in the weeks when they were not microdosing.

After prolonged microdosing, there is a small percentage of people who report that without microdosing they no longer feel happy, creative, or productive enough. As a result, they develop psychological dependence on microdosing. However, this can also be explained by the nocebo effect (opposite of the placebo effect: you think things are bad and therefore you feel bad).

**Known risks**

* May increase anxiety. This is why people with generalized anxiety disorder are more likely to not benefit from microdosing (as opposed to people with specific anxiety disorder).
* People with paranoia may experience increased paranoia and suspicion during microdosing.
* Mushrooms may cause mild stomach upset and nausea in sensitive individuals.
* Fatigue. Mainly during microdosing of psilocybin. Some experience this as a disadvantage; others do not and take the microdose before going to bed (the Nightcap protocol).
* Some people who take a microdose before going to bed experience a radically reduced amount of deep sleep on microdosing days.
* People diagnosed with bipolar disorder reported that they benefited from microdosing during their depressive phase, but would advise against it during a manic phase.
* Psilocybin can cause headaches in some people, especially at doses that are either just higher than a sub-perceptual dose, or just not high enough in the case of a macro dose.

**Not recommended in these situations**

* For people under 18
* In combination with alcohol or other drugs
* In pregnancy or while breastfeeding
* People taking lithium carbonate medication (Lithium). This combination is not recommended until more is known about it.
* People who have experienced psychosis. Although there have been no reports of people diagnosed with psychosis as a result of microdosing, it is known that higher doses of psychedelics may allow for latent psychosis. Therefore, this possibility should not be ruled out for the time being.
* People with generic anxiety or an anxiety disorder. The anxiety may be magnified, or they may become more aware of their anxiety. On the other hand, for people who suffer from depression and have specific anxiety disorders, it may actually help to alleviate their fears.
* People suffering from paranoia/suspicion. Microdosing can increase paranoia.

**Combining with other medications**

Dr. James Fadiman and his colleague Sophia Korb have compiled a list of medications, supplements and drugs that are so far known to cause no adverse side effects when combined with microdosing. The list comes from data collected through their long-term study of hundreds of subjects who have microdosed independently.

* Always consult your doctor first if you plan to combine, stop or taper any medication.
* Remember: no one is expert enough on microdosing at this time to be able to advise you on how to stop taking medication.
* If you want to taper off because you suspect microdosing is a better alternative, consult with your doctor and research the pros and cons.

2021-07-23 17:26:40,Psilocybin truly only a tool,"I just recently started to MD and at first I felt nothing and felt that it wasn’t working because subconsciously I was taking it for the “quick fix”. After about a week of nothing I was feeling doubtful until something came up that I would normally avoid and suppress but this time it was different, I didn’t avoid it and oh boy! Once I accepted it I felt like years of suppressed emotion came flooding out of me. I will say at first it was to much to handle but once the crying was over I had this sense of relief I can’t describe. I thank everyone here for really emphasizing how this stuff is a tool and hard work needs to be done for it to work.

2019-10-09 16:24:08,Finally found a way to keep microdosing!,"I started around .2-.3 g of mushrooms once per week (usually on Tuesdays for some reason...) back around April or May. When I say this has changed my life, it’s almost an understatement.

I’ve suffered severe anxiety, depression, panic attacks and agoraphobia since childhood, and I’ve tried everything. I’ve seen multiple therapists and psychiatrists, tried CBT, every antidepressant and benzodiazepine, basically anything you can think of and none of it really helped at all. I was a prisoner inside my mind for years.

...Until microdosing! I think I had some mushrooms leftover from a large supply my friends and I had all bought, and one day I just decided, fuck it, I’ll try! I’ve tried with acid before but I found it harder to portion and it seemed to amplify negative feelings which was not something I wanted.

ANYWAY, I’m rambling. But I was talking to my new coworker and asked him if he knew where to get some since I ran out a few weeks ago. I was resigned to going back to my old ways of life, but he actually said he microdoses too and has a solid connection! I am so happy I could cry. I’m just excited to continue to be the person I am without the depression and negative thoughts. I am working on becoming that person full-time, without any help, but for now it’s nice to know I have options again. 

Hope everyone is having a wonderful day!!",40,1361,7,244,0

2020-04-28 15:49:42,My blissful experience micro-dosing mushrooms.,"Ok to give some context. I'm 18 and have been doing mushrooms on and off for about 2 years recreationally but I've been around them and had the opportunity to do them since I was probably 13 I just never had the balls. My father died when I was 16 and it really fucked me up, this was around the same time I was ready to do mushrooms so I put it off for a bit cause I was worried I would have a bad trip in relation to my dad, I ended up starting eating mushrooms that summer though. But up until early 2020, I was always doing them recreationally, I knew they were significant somehow but I never acknowledged the important connection between mushrooms/religion/spirituality.

So about a month ago I started micro-dosing (\~100mg every 3 days) and it was great! I found myself in a more flow-state mind 24/7, doing things like dishes were much easier because of that flow-state. I started taking about 10-20 minutes a day out to chill outside and listen to 432hz vibrations and appreciate nature. This is when I had a miracle moment.

(edit: something I forgot to mention, bout a week before this next part took place, I asked my dad before bed in my prayers if he could give me a sign he is up there, that I'm no longer scared. But he didn't show me anything that night.)

I dosed this same morning for the second time in my life. It was one of the first really nice sunny days of the summer (edit: spring lol) so I was sitting in my nan's garage listening to 432hz and looking out the small garage door windows. It was very calming and relaxing. Total flow-state. I wasn't worried about anything just showing gratitude to nature. I then rolled and sparked up a nice doob which made me even more relaxed. Bout a minute after sparking it I noticed the smoke dancing through the beams of sun coming through the door windows. (Smoke dancing through sum beams is so beautiful) I was being mesmerized by the smoke and just looking at the windows behind it in a complete trance. As I started moving closer to the window this is when the complete blissful miracle feeling started to set in. HARD. As I was walking closer it seemed as the sun started getting brighter, the birds starting chirping louder. I looked out the window with a huge smile on my face, closed my eyes and took a deep breath just to soak it all in. When I opened my eyes a cardinal came out of nowhere and landed on the tree. I know it's just a bird but I felt a sudden and abnormal connection with this bird, that when I die and become part of nature I will be one with the bird. The bird sat on the single tree in front of the garage and stared at me, I looked wide-eyed at it and then after a moment, it flew away. I didn't really think much of it at the time just the fact that I had a beautiful moment where I connected with nature, and had a new appreciation for micro-dosing mushrooms.

I was thinking a lot about this moment for the next few days and to this day have still never felt something like it. I had to do some more digging to see if anyone has ever had a similar situation. After telling my good friend about this story that he was reminded of. He was sitting on the dock with his dad mourning over his dog, and a single bird (idk if he said it was a cardinal) flew right in front of him and looked at him and his dad, He said his dad thought it was their dog reminding them that the afterlife is real. I then made the connections and realized that the Cardinal was my dad, (edit: Cardinals represent reincarnation)  telling me I'm doing good and that he's proud of me and definitely still in the universe, watching over me in the afterlife.

2017-08-28 21:40:32,I've been microdosing for more than a decade. Happy to see there is a community of people interested in it.,"Hi, I first learned about microdosing a long time ago, in college in 1990.  At that time, I had lots of LSD on hand and no instruction, so that's what I used.  

I used to trip regularly in high school. I found despite the massive discomfort of tripping in class, it helped me absorb concepts quickly, so Fridays I would take them for the long physics lecture my excellent teacher provided that day.  My friends used psychedelics for fun, and while they are often fun, I've always had an emphasis on personal growth.  My first trip was terrible, but i learned so much about myself I had to try again.  And again.

Back to microdosing: for about a month in 1990, I microdosed M-F.  I noticed a cumulative effect, so by Friday I'd be creeping into a full trip.  For various reasons, I stopped for many years.  

A decade or so ago, I was gifted some mushrooms, and I've been microdosing since.  I usually take them every third or 4th day, and sometimes I take a month or two off, either I run out or just don't want to.  I took more than a year off once.

I've found that my personal & emotional growth in that time has been excellent.  I have been attracting high-quality people into my life and subtracted low-vibration people.  Dogs love me.  I exercise nearly every day now.  I stopped eating meat & factory food, not really by choice, but because it doesn't sound good and doesn't make me feel good.  I can usually spot a lie easily, even when it's not apparent.  Things that are true have a different resonance than things that are false, and I use that information a whole lot.  It doesn't always work, but most of the time.  My relationships with my family have become wonderful, and I am a happier and better person than I used to be.

I was happy to discover that more people are doing this, as it's been an amazing tool for self-realization for me.  I think humanity is evolving, and though we had a big jump in the late 60s, we've been sliding backwards since then.  Even then, psychedelics weren't respected or used correctly.  I think microdosing is the correct use of such things, with an occasional break and an occasional normal dose in safe and natural circumstances. 

Saying that, it's not for everyone.  I've seen people take too much of things and not come back all the way.  I've seen people's mental illnesses get worse.  It's is not a cure-all for everyone, but for certain people, it seems to help a whole lot.

I'm no expert, but if anyone has questions about MY experience, I would be happy to answer.",107,2527,20,457,0
2022-01-10 15:17:59,"Took my morning dose about an hour ago, giving a presentation at work in about fifteen","A thinking to myself, wait where was that decimal place again? 

Wish me luck!

Update:

Sorry for the delay, I had some life stuff come up but I wanted to put out an update anyway so maybe at least one person can learn from me xD

I normally take .11 grams but I think it was closer to a full gram. I was absolutely positive I was going to freak out and give myself away, but I either held myself together, or no one was paying enough attention to me to notice.

The first thing I noticed was that my mind felt more scattered than normal. It also felt like more blood was riding to my head.

Next, whenever I closed my eyes, I could see what almost looked like fractals spread across my visual field. That's the best way I can describe it.

When speaking, I THINK I sounded normal, but at the end of every sentence I kept wondering if I actually said what I thought I said. This resulted in some longer than normal silences.

It's been a couple weeks now and I still have a job, so while it may be anticlimactic, I'm happy that I'm not sending out resumes at the moment. Overall, I don't recommend anything higher than a microdose for work and will be checking my scale closer in the future!!!",86,1194,16,228,0

It’s initiated a calm on my mind too, no longer is my mind cluttered of thoughts or worries that I couldn’t control!

2022-01-30 18:36:57,.5 grams of mushrooms for 30 days,"The last 5 years have been quite the experience with an ever revolving door of consequences and problems that come along with alcoholism. Blacking out twice a week, and being hungover every single day. 

Each day I was to take .5 grams of mushrooms starting on January 1st (New Years just being a consequence). Also started eating a organic plant based diet, lots of nuts, lots of berries, but chicken once a week. My rule of thumb is to eat foods that are colorful and diverse. No butter, no milk, no dairy. Drinking one gallon of alkaline water a day. (I also started using olive oil instead of soap while showering which is unrelated but wow my skin feels amazing). And using a sauna for one hour every week. 

I decided to start running every other day as well, and have ran almost 75 miles miles this month. Even though I have done serious hikes like the PCT, I have never been a runner. Now I’m running 6-11 miles in a single day. Weather conditions being -20 to 24 degrees Fahrenheit for what it’s worth. 

I have found myself going almost all day without even thinking about alcohol. Cravings for alcohol have diminished almost altogether. The exception being when a roommate is drinking near me.

I feel reborn. I feel amazing. Just thought I’d share. Hope you have a good day. Thank you:)",33,1298,7,233,0
2021-08-19 03:31:20,Microdosing removes the need to procrastinate,"I have been taking macrodoses for a couple months as I have been experiencing debilitating anxiety symptoms for over 8 years and I have experienced astounding results. Nonetheless, I would still slip back into old habits a few days after the afterglow. Since I started microdosing I have been experiencing a strong urge to stop procrastinating. There are items on my to-do list that I have been trying to get through for months that I am now working through without a feeling of guilt. What I have realized is I usually procrastinate because I feel a sense of guilt for not getting the task done in the past so I focus on that fact instead of focusing on the present where I have the ability to get the task done in the NOW. It's quite refreshing to feel the dopamine rush and positivity from completing such work items instead of dwelling in depressive thought loops. I'm thankful that this community has been so helpful in my journey to heal myself from Generalized Anxiety Disorder. 

Along with microdosing I practice meditation, journaling, strength training as I have realized that I need to create a system that allows me to calm my mind without a psychoactive substance. Using all of these tools in tandem is proving that with effort psilocybin can cure severe anxiety disorders.",45,1287,6,223,0
2023-04-02 01:53:37,I have a dissociative disorder and microdosing psilocybin has been the only thing that eases symptoms.,"I've been dissociated since I was 16 years old. I can barely recall anything from the last 6–7 years. When I take psilocybin mushrooms, if I get the dose right, I feel completely normal for like 8 hours. If I could take them every day, I would. No medication has even come close to helping me like psilocybin has. I wish there were something I could do or take to make the effects last longer. Or forever. To feel completely normal again, all the time, would be a dream come true. If you have any additional advice or comments, I would love to hear from you.",102,558,16,106,0
2023-02-02 08:33:18,LSD makes me feel alive for the first time in years.,"So I have been microdosing mushrooms for about a year, on and off and have enjoyed every part of it. It has really helped me get through a rough part of my life. It has helped with my anxiety depression and lifelong binge eating. I mean ever since I can remember I have had an unquenchable hunger. Part of that is how I used food as a coping method for anxiety which in turn made it worse. I ballooned up to over 450lbs. Through the use of psilocybin both micro and macro doses I have seemed to be able to kick the compulsive eating. I have dropped 210 lbs and am still going strong at losing the weight. It really does help with addictions. I have been able to focus my time on my side hustles to compensate for the insane inflation these days and I am living much more comfortably financially, physically and mentally.  

This brings me to why I made the post in the first place. I quit using caffeine about a year ago due to high blood pressure. I also hated how I had to use it to function. I started microdosing LSD about a month ago. I made up a dropper bottle with distilled water. Tested the tabs before hand. All that good stuff. So I take my first dose about 1/8th of a tab. It's hard to explain. It's like my brain got turned on. I have found that 1/4 of a tab to be my perfect dose. It's so nice on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. It lasts for 12 hours with no crash.  It's not like caffeine where I feel wired and like I have to do something. Or other stims that make you feel gritty and crash after. I listen to music all day, go to the gym, stretch and do physical therapy and get stuff done. I feel like life has meaning again I haven't felt suicidal in a long time. I'm really looking forward to spring and summer and getting outside into nature again.  Now that I can actually move around more. This weekend I plan on trying out a more substantial recreational dose. I have been scared of it for way too long but I'm not anymore. 

TL, DR : Mushrooms are great, helped with depression and helpted me lose weight. Tried microdosing LSD and was surprised how energizing and eye opening it is. Happy for the future! ✌️🍄😎❤️",52,2150,11,413,0

2022-01-14 16:55:01,Mushrooms gave me a rich mindset. Now I have to cut my family off because they're all jealous of my life. The same family who called me a crackhead for doing mushrooms lol,"I was broke, depressed, and desperate. I decided to ask the universe/ God during a 4g  Mazatapec trip to help me find my way financially. I came back to reality with a business mind. I came back with a NEW understanding of money. I started a business that I always wanted to start but never had the courage. Always doubted myself. Mushrooms fixed that. 

Now I am doing so well in life that my ENTIRE FAMILY is jealous of me. They are very toxic. I told them that they can do mushrooms and change their life like I did, but they are hell bent on jealousy and hatred. It hurts really bad. They would rather tare ME DOWN, than to work on themselves and become HAPPY like me.



My family ridiculed me for doing mushrooms, but now I've passed all of them up financially and their jealousy has forced me to cut them out of my life.  Mushrooms changed my life both spiritually AND financially. I thought it was just a trip, but now my life looks amazing. It's crazy. Mushrooms are the REAL DEAL. But nobody believes me lol. They SEE my results, they SEE my happiness, and are JEALOUS of me, but CANNOT ACCEPT that mushrooms are the reason. Probably because it's their ONLY weapon against me. Idk why they hate me so much smh. It's unhealthy to be STUCK on Hate Mode. But that's where they are mentally. I guess it's THEM vs ME because I'm the one who does psychedelics. I'm the Black sheep of the family. And they hate me even MORE now that I've leveled up in life.

I was just wondering if psychedelics has changed any of you to the point where you had to deal with JEALOUSY because others saw the change in you. Because that's EXACTLY what happened to me. I'm living a great life now but I feel so alone. Psychedelics are a GOD SEND but for some reason people don't WANT to understand them. Even if they SEE your positive results. Why?",171,1832,33,343,0

2019-11-09 08:33:44,Microdosing LSD to curb smoking cannabis,"I honestly wasn’t expecting much change but man I was wrong. Im still within the first two weeks of MDing and my entire view of weed changed. 
I’ve been a heavy smoker for around 5 years now and I know it’s about time to be done with it. I started microdosing just to see what all the hype was about but if I had a goal in mind it would be to help me stop smoking.
I took my 10 ug MD a couple days ago and took two bong rips about 6 hours later that afternoon (I normally didn’t smoke until late on an MD day) and within 5 minutes I was green sick. (I can usually smoke bowls and not be super stoned.) 
Now I’ve greened out my fair share and usually just throw up and feel better, but this time was different. I sat next to the toilet and threw up everything in my stomach but the overwhelming high wouldn’t subside. I drank water and just immediately threw it back up over and over to try to get anything else out. After about an hour and a half I was finally able to crawl into my bed and slept for 13 hours straight. 
I’ve had two MD days since and I think I’ve smoked about 3 times total, whereas I would previously smoke 3-4 times a day. I can easily tell how much weed clouds my brain on MD days and I think I’m just finally ready to have clarity again. 
Nothing I’ve ever tried until now has gotten me to see any negative aspects of weed. It was my cure-all. I smoked to curb my emotions, for physical pain, for fun, etc. Now I feel like smoking is only causing me to be sluggish and almost sick feeling. 
I really don’t know how LSD can change my entire stance on cannabis so damn fast but I think I’m just over it at this point. I want my mind to have a boost not a fog and I really didn’t realize how bad it was until now. 
 I don’t know if having the thought of wanting to quit in the back of my mind helped my brain just figure it out finally but I’m giving most of the credit to the microdose. I really just don’t want to smoke anymore, I feel like the benefits don’t outweigh the negatives and three months ago I would have told you weed is all I will ever need.

Edit: I think I’m going to buy a CBD cart, (I live in an illegal state and having any sort of bud means stress IMO) I’ve had them in the past and they seem to calm me down and keep the hand to mouth at bay.",40,2284,6,464,0

2020-04-21 14:57:36,I started microdosing shrooms and now I talk to trees,"Hey guys,

I came here to give you somewhat of a report of my recent microdosing of mushrooms. 
I am very anxious person with some inner demons (which I deal with one by one), so even though I was always interested in psychedelics, I was careful.
But considering the current situation I decided to give microdosing a try, because I like to experiment with things and trying new stuff here and there and here comes the report.
Let me give you some perspective, I am a 25 year old guy with a little idea of what to do with his life, and since my last birthday (January) it is somehow becoming more and more clear to me who I am. Since January I started to admire nature and simple things more (maybe it had something to do with six month meditation and psychotherapy) and my life has been more stable. I also bought a little yellow notepad that I bring everywhere to “write off” current demons, issues or just to talk to myself.
And now comes the microdosing part. I started microdosing 2-3 weeks ago, one day on, two days off, redose. I’m not sure about the dose because my scale is fucked up, but I guess it is something around 0,05g of thoroughly chopped mushrooms.
And man what the hell happened. I mean, I have been reading about this for a long time so I kind of expected lesser anxiety, better concentration and higher creativity (I am graphic designer). But what is the most interesting bonus for me is my higher admiration of nature, I am almost constantly in some kond of natural calm and AWW feeling towards nature. I watch animals and love them 1000 times more than I ever did, I touch trees and somehow “feel their energy” (woo woo shit, but I feel it like this and I love it), and a few days ago I went for a walk to forest and ended up having imaginary discussion with beautiful old tree which I wrote to my little yellow notepad.
I enjoy every fucking second in nature and I LOVE THIS, because it is really something I did not expected.
The peace I get from nature now is immense.

2022-07-04 16:18:10,Finally happened- I “overdosed” and had a very interesting workday.,"I typically dose .22g of Golden Teacher on a 1 on 2 off schedule. I’ve dialed in the dosage to be imperceptible, and have been really happy with the results over the past few months. I’m more motivated, emotionally regulated, open minded, and less anxious than I’ve ever been. 

I re-upped my supply last week- and these mushrooms were absolutely gorgeous. Like fairytale toadstool beauties. I broke off and weighed one of the little buddies this morning. Came in at .29 and I didn’t have the heart to break her. Honestly, she was adorable. I ate her, chugged some water, and went about my day. 

30 minutes later I felt a bit…tingly. I usually feel a trip coming up in my mouth- it’s hard to describe, but it feels warm, soft, and just more - noticeable? I immediately knew that I was in for a bit of a ride. I moved my 10a meeting to assess, and went outside for a walk. From there it came on quick- euphoria, giggles, mild breathing visuals and general vibrancy to everything. 

My mind was bouncing between content nothing and an almost overwhelming creativity. It was impossible to look at my computer- it was blurry, and my mind was moving faster than my eyes could comprehend. I tried to write a quick email and it took me about 40 minutes.

I completely forgot about my 11:30 meeting- and received a dreaded “does now still work?” ping. I went in with butterflies in my stomach, all but certain I’d make an ass of myself. But friends, I must say it was the best meeting of my life. The conversation flowed, the ideas blossomed, and everything radiated positivity and empathy. It was the first meeting of my life that felt natural. Our dialogue flowed with honesty, and we were incredibly efficient. Not sure if it was my body language, candor, or some universal wavelength, but everything clicked in a pleasant way. 

I rode the waves for another hour or so before returning to stasis. I’m blown away that .06g can make such a difference.

That’s all- cheers and bon voyage!",67,1982,10,354,0

2018-09-24 13:50:52,"i did it, i microdosed Amphetamine, and im happy","so recently there was a post asking if its ok to microdose stims, someone shared a informative post about that where its explained that that leads to hyper sensibility and all that. 

in the post its explained that it can lead to a boost of confidence, euphoria, etc but also to motor tics, sleep problems and impulsive thoughts.

sinc im  diagnosed bpd and impulsive in generell and also depressed since lile forever i felt like i want to give it a shot,
yesterday i took a tiny amount of speed (oral) and today i woke up with the best mood i had in years, i feel genuinely happy and it feels so fucking good to be able to smile again, im actually motivated to do shit!


the last few months i only slept and cried a lot, i was in one of my worst depression phases and all anti depressants i tried didnt do shit, i just felt dehumanized from them.

i can only repeat it once more, im fucking happy! i took a walk of 2 hours, made some important phone calls that i previously was too scared of, i am actually motivated to get up and do SOMETHING


its the first day and maybe there are some bad things to come with it im the next few days, in primates the results of microdosing stims were obversable for over 2.5 years! so it definately is a risk, but if your life is shit anyways, might wanna give this a try, 

for anyone interested yoh can save this post and i will update on my situation daily.


lets get my life back together!


Edit: Please do your own research on that matter if you want to try it, it certainly has its risks!


so i slept a few hours and still feel good, thanks for all the concerns and tips, i do not plan on taking any more amphetamine, i just wanted to trigger the hyper sensibility, i know its a risk and that i probably have to pay for that at some point, but right now this is exactly whag i needed to get my life back on track! before that i was just miserable and depressed, i didnt even eat for a few days and it just got worse and worse, right now i have the power to take care of my stuff and work on things. So i gladly take this risk, however this is not advised and more of a ""do as i say, not as i do"" 

i'll keep you posted

EDIT: well g fucking g, as /u/tryntofeelgood said, ""watch for (hypo)mania"".
so i just felt a bit tooo happy and to euphoric, i read articles for a few hours now and i might just be Bipolar and this is my first hypomania phase... it all fits together perfectly, the speed microdose didnt do shit or maybe just induced this hypomania, but im 95% certain i might actually be Bipolar.. jesus fuck, i have an appointment with my psychologist later, i will update when i come back.",48,2643,9,513,0
2021-06-08 14:41:12,A walk in nature is as good or better than microdosing,"Convince me I am wrong, my argument below, including why we would be erroneously convinced microdosing is better

## What are the benefits of microdosing? 

They are mainly improving mood and focus. [One study ](https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-019-0308-4)found 27% for the first and 15% for the second. There is a [benefit in mental health](https://www.verywellmind.com/microdosing-definition-effects-uses-risks-legality-5076107#perceived-benefits): stress, anxiety, depression. And improved creativity. However the latter is self-reported, so it only shows that people think they are more creative, not necessarily that they have more creative output.

You can see from the percentages that microdosing is not a sure thing. Many people don’t experience any benefit. 

# Better than microdosing: walks in nature

A simple walk in nature provides the same benefits and more.

Let’s look at some data.

A walk in the forest significantly reduces stress and anxiety: decrease in [cortisol levels](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00376/full), decrease in [sympathetic system activity](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/2/229), decrease in [blood pressure and heart rate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866717302017?via%3Dihub), and [better self-reported mood and anxiety](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/12/2804), according to studies done on forest bathing by Yoshifumi Miyazaki. There is also a visible effect on anxiety: the facial muscles relax.

For focus and creativity there are significant benefits as exposure to nature calms and recharges the Pre Frontal Lobe. This enables much higher focus and creativity throughout the whole day. How much higher? [David Strayer at the University of Utah ran a study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233950186_Creativity_in_the_Wild_Improving_Creative_Reasoning_through_Immersion_in_Natural_Settings) to measure this using an objective measure of creativity. The results? A **50% increase in creativity as a result of exposure to nature for four days.**

>*Creativity increases by 50% from exposure to nature.*

Listening to bird song and seeing fractals (which are widespread in nature) amplifies the brain’s alpha waves which makes you feel more calm and alert.

How quick are the effects of a walk in nature? You need only 5 minutes in a forest for your mind and body to start to change.

Better yet, research suggests that being in nature at least 5 hours a month makes you happier overall. This works out to 1.25 hours a week, or about 10 minutes per day. It’s a laughably small time investment.

For much more depth on the benefits of nature, read [Florence Williams](https://www.florencewilliams.com/) wonderful book [The Nature Fix](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35187181-the-nature-fix). You can find in-depth exploration of these benefits, and more.

Beyond data, great thinkers through time have extolled the benefits of walks in nature. Aristotle took walks to clarify the mind. Darwin, Tesla and Einstein used walks in nature to think. Teddy Roosevelt took months in the open countryside. Nietzsche said he wrote much of his books while hiking the mountains. These men achieved great things. The fact that they attribute so much of their focus and creativity to walking in nature is strong proof.

# Why is microdosing popular and walks in the park are not?

One researcher into the benefits of nature points out that the lack of exposure to nature makes people underestimate its benefits. “People may avoid nearby nature because their disconnect from nature causes them to underestimate its hedonic benefits.” [Elizabeth K. Nisbeth](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-010-9197-7)

On the other hand microdosing is not common. However it has several characteristics that make it appear more valuable. Namely its difficulty, exclusivity and risk. It activates our bias of thinking that scarcity indicates value.

Microdosing is rather difficult. You don’t walk into a drugstore and buy a microdosing kit. The substances involved are not legal in most countries. You need to work to find providers online. These have questionable reputation and no authority regulates the substances. This means there is a real risk that you might get nothing active or even harmful.

Microdosing has scarcity and risk. It also has novelty. We see it as a 21st Century hack of our biology. All of these attributes makes it exclusive. It has social value. It signals certain characteristics, and belonging to a certain tribe, something along the lines of high-tech, entrepreneurial high achievers. The association with Silicon Valley greatly amplifies this association.

On the other hand, walks in the park or nature are easy. Anybody can do it. Everybody has been doing it for most of human history. There is little social value in it.

**We do things as much for their social signaling value as for their intrinsic value. This quirk makes microdosing more popular than walks in the park, although it is more difficult and less effective.**",54,5095,11,718,0

2017-12-18 00:14:28,Report of Microdoses of MDMA at 200ug.,"So, I have seen a lot of people advising not to try microdosing MDMA at all, but at the same time almost every report that actually lists the dose shows the user doing something like 5+ mg, many doing something like 10-35mg.

My thought was that a lower dose may be possible, and wanted to test for myself what dose is really threshold. So 6 weeks back I made up a solution of 10mg of MDMA dissolved into 50ml of distilled water, for 200ug : 1ml ratio. The intention was to try once every few weeks when I had a quiet day, start with 1ml of solution, and increase to see at what point noticeable effects would occur in me. What I noticed was with the first 200ug dose that even such a tiny amount did appear to cause a noticeable effect. 

Now this could just be placebo, or possibly the MDMA powder is laced with another chemical that I did not notice with regent testing. But on 3 occasions with the same dose, it seems to reliably produce a mild euphoric effect, making music and media more enjoyable, and lowers anxiety, with the effect lasting about 2 hours. It is slight, but does seem to be there.

I am hoping in the future to start a more controlled experiment, and keep better notes about the duration, effects, and how spaced out each dose is. I want to see if the results continue to be reproducible when used once every week, and maybe come up with a scheme to mix in some placebos as a control. 

While it isn't much, I figured I could share my experience so far. Nothing conclusive yet, could be all in my head, but I think it is worth investigating more.

2017-12-19 17:41:17,Buying Bitcoin: 101,"This is a post for anyone who doesn't understand bitcoin. Most of us do, but I felt like helping the noobies.


It's not that difficult. The first time I did it, it took me about 1.5 hours (from researching how to get the coin, to placing my first RC order). Now it takes me about 5 minutes.

**THE BITCOIN BREAKDOWN**

-Add product to your cart to determine the amount of bitcoin you owe.

-Determine how much bitcoin (BTC) you owe for your purchase. Always purchase about $10 more worth of BTC than what you actually owe, to cover all fees. For example if your cart total is $50 in BTC, purchase $60 of BTC. Here are your three best options for purchasing coin, in my experience:

**(1)** Create a CoinBase account and purchase it directly with a credit or debit card. Keep in mind the sign up process is lengthy and requires verification from your credit/debit account. This is not difficult, and CoinBase will walk you through the entire process. However, depending on the specific credit or debit account you decide to link, it may take 10 minutes to verify, or up to 5 days. Large, well-established banks tend to link quicker. Also keep in mind that not all credit and debit cards are accepted. You just have to try for yourself. Also, those prepaid Visa/Mastercard gift cards do NOT work. Lastly, after you purchase the coin through CoinBase, you need to transfer it to a different bitcoin wallet that you set up. I use BlockChain. The reason for this is that CoinBase may potentially ban you after using your account to purchase RC's or other legally gray-area products/services. So you transfer your BTC to a different account and purchase your RC's from that account (BlockChain, or whatever wallet you choose—not CoinBase.

**(2)** Google “Bitcoin ATM.” If there is one located in an area that you are willing to drive to, you can literally put cash into the machine and purchase bitcoin directly that way. There is a fee for this, which I believe is typically more hefty than CoinBase fees. Before you go to the BTC ATM, you will need to set up a wallet (like BlockChain). Either download the app or create an account through their website. If you go the ATM route, the app will make your purchase go much smoother, as you can scan the QR code to your bitcoin account upon purchase. Using the BlockChain app to send/receive BTC is pretty much self-explanatory.

**(3)** Purchase Amazon gift cards at a store with cash. Create an account on Paxful and exchange a picture of your card’s code, along with the receipt, for roughly 80% of the card’s value in BTC. I don’t recommend this method unless it’s your only option. It ends up being the most expensive.

-Regardless of which method you choose, you need to end up with your coin in an account like BlockChain. From there, you press the send button on the block chain app and type in the amount of coin you owe, or scan the QR code from your purchase summary (self-explanatory, like I said). You must do this fairly soon after finalizing your cart, as the value of bitcoin rises and falls, you may end up having an issue with your purchase if you wait too long.

-That's pretty much it! There are other websites and methods of purchasing bitcoin, but in my experience, the three options I outlined above are among the simplest. If anyone has other methods, or more details to add, please comment and I will update this post. I hope you found this helpful!",19,3418,3,608,0

2017-06-17 09:26:39,Am I unethical for microdosing for an exam?,"So I've never done this before and 2 days ago Ive had my first year uni maths finals. My sleep patterns were off for awhile so I ended up not sleeping the night before with my exam the following afternoon. 

I was abit worried cramming that night cause I just couldn't focus no matter how many cups of coffee I had and then it hit me. I bought a few 105ug tabs the other day for the break and remember my dealer (who is an advocate for MD) mentioned that it helps with creativity and focus. So I gave it a shot, got the gloves out and cut about 1/10 of a tab and then contuined with my cramming. After about  2 hours I noticed something. Nothing major just my thought felt more organized. Its not like I became a child genius or anything, I just felt awake. This was around 3am. Going into my exam around 1:30pm I felt nervous but calm like I was ready. Question after question I was pumping them out. Maybe the lsd wore off by then or it was helping me keep my momentum or it could've been just a placebo effect by that time. I'm not sure but my question is.

It is unethical to mircodose for exams? I have a feeling it gave me an unfair advantage similar to when people take steroid for tested federations of powerlifting. I'm a heavy advocate of anti drug use for powerlifting but does this make me a hypocrite for using a drug to increase my ability with a standardized test?

2018-08-16 17:00:40,"Microdosing cocaïne, bad idea?","I tried microdosing cocaïne (about 1/10th of a regular line) in today's and yesterday's morning. It helps me wake up, and throughout the whole day I'll feel more happy, enjoy listening to music way more and am more social at work. I have never done cocaïne before this. 

I think the effects are minor but very positive for me, and am wondering if this is safe to continue with.

I'm also concerned about dosage going up over time, because I build up a tolerance. Does this go fast, even when only microdosing? And if I suddenly quit, would I go back to my normal self or is there a chance the social aspect I gain from cocaïne would somehow stick with me, or am I able to learn from?

All feedback appreciated. I've done some research but couldn't find the answers to my questions

Thanks!

Edit:
A lot of people say it's a bad idea because it is addictive. Anybody that knows about the health concerns?

I’ll likely stick to 15-20mg/day of Adderall on study days (4-5 days a week) and have a few off days. I’m not totally sure how I want to incorporate my microdoses. I’m curious to hear how others have benefited.

2019-09-17 16:51:07,Degradation is imminent .. if you don't develop yourself.,"Let me introduce myself.

I'm adept of 4th (The teaching of George Gurdjieff) way and Don Huan's or Castaneda's teaching. That's more than 20 years in esoteric and self development.

All I do it develop myself. And 4th way has knowledge about how do we work and how to to effectively increase development speed. The goal is to reach conciseness in a single lifetime.

I have a friend from Russian, who has a degree in Oxford in biochemistry. He is a friend of mine and has been closely connected with microdosing. He knows and studies nootropics and how they work. I consult with him a lot.

So a year ago I've started to microdose mushrooms in Netherlands. The 4th way has a note that certain herbs accumulate higher energies, that are coming from the planets and suns above the earth. Like coffee, nicotine, tee, cannabis and others. And that they play a certain role in a humans life.

According to that knowledge, they give ""free"" energies, a human body, mind and emotions need.

I've had a lot of self observations to tell, that that's true. Microdosing definitely speeds up self development. But I've had a long intellectual discussion with my esoteric friends about consequences. After coming to a conclusion, I've checked it with my Russian friend. And he confirmed it.

In short, he confirmed, that some of the people people who micro/microdose or trip in Russia degrade over long time.

Why? Our teaching says, that person needs to put effort into all what he is doing. And without effort he becomes lazy. Getting ""free"" emotions, intellectual boost, he may not do anything. And here comes the IMPORTANT part: medicine knows, that our body DESTROYS parts of it's systems that are not being used. It's true for blood vessels, muscles, and so on. My friend has confirmed, that he SAW degradation in people, consuming mushrooms a lot. He told it's like on steroids. If you take steroids, you need to run 3 times faster.

A simpler analogy, if you win 1000.000 and stop working, after 3 years you will not be able to work anymore and will end with a lot of friends and no money. If you keep working and investing, you will get 10.000.000 and 10 times more friends.

In short, if you microdose, at least to intellectual exercises and try to develop emotions.

2017-11-15 04:32:16,"Yes, you are supposed to feel it","""Sub-perceptual"" doses are nonsense. They are the homeopathy of psychedelics. Psychoactive substances are just that: psychoactive. If you don't feel anything, that means it isn't doing anything, and you need to take more.

Look, I'm all for increased acceptance and understanding of psychedelics. And I'm of the opinion that the doses recreational users typically use are way too high to achieve that with the broader public. But that doesn't mean we need to support homeopathy. Microdosing should be understood as *threshold* doses where subtle psychoactive effects are felt.

Here's a simple question for people who think ""sub-perceptual"" doses have any value at all: have you ever done a blind dosing trial? Yes, you can blind doses for yourself. [I'm sure some people here are familiar with Gwern's article on the subject](https://www.gwern.net/LSD-microdosing). Why is Gwern the only one who's done this? Why haven't the people promoting microdosing ever done such a trial? It's not because these substances are illegal: there have been plenty of studies done on, say, mushrooms, which confirm pretty extreme positive effects of high doses. Here's one such study: [Psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experience in combination with meditation and other spiritual practices produces enduring positive changes in psychological functioning and in trait measures of prosocial attitudes and behaviors](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881117731279). Jim Fadiman could arrange for such a study in to microdosing if he wanted to. Why doesn't he? From Gwern's article:

> The comments on my LSD microdosing experiment bring this out in dramatic relief: everyone is eager to find some flaw, no matter how improbable, which will let them dismiss the results completely and not update in the slightest bit. Will any of them do a better experiment to improve the claimed fatal flaw? Nope. I can’t even except Fadiman here. While he didn’t give me any of the bullshit a lot of people did, I asked him before I posted it whether he or anyone else had attempted to replicate my experiment. No one had. To emphasize that: Fadiman is a trained psychologist who appreciates the need for systematic data collection + randomization + blinding with easy access to LSD who is keenly interested in microdosing inasmuch as he has done microdosing for decades while publicly professing its value, who understands & admires my procedure and has had at least half a year to replicate my experiment himself - and has not done so!

> It’s not like this is a trivial issue for him, it’s his decades-long career at this point. It’s not like it’s a trivial question for microdosing users, microdosing is a hassle which comes with real legal risk & cost. Yet…

If you haven't done a blind trial, and your doses are so low that you can't even tell you're on the substance, then you're probably just getting the placebo effect. Which is cool, if it helps you with personal issues in your life, but it's irresponsible to then tell other people that your ""sub-perceptual"" dose is responsible for those benefits.",32,3090,7,495,0

2019-12-23 00:09:48,I fully intend to be down voted: Anyone MD while practicing NoFap?,"Scientifically NoFap was described, on a YouTube channel, to rewire the dopamine reward system. The idea is that if you stop watching porn and then hold off on masturbating your dopamine reward system is reset and this can strongly help with anxiety and confidence. A rat study seemed to show that the introduction of a novel female rat will cause the rat to engage in mating the new female rat each time so much so that the rat will eventually mate himself to death. This is what is thought to occur with porn. No human, not to my knowledge at least, has wanked themselves to death but the click rate and porn watched on a daily basis for the average man does increase dramatically and in turn short cuts the dopamine reward system i.e. instead of asking that attractive girl out I will go home and find a porn star that looks just like her to gain that dopamine hit. Basically it prevents men from taking on hard tasks that men of yesteryear are soo easily accustomed to.

2023-01-15 01:12:01,Is microdosing in a world with smart phones / social media weird?,"The last time I did mushrooms, not only did social media not exist, cell phones didn’t exist. 

My dad might have had a giant flip phone and my mom had a car phone (remember those?). 

It was a different time. 

I remember when we would trip, we’d start off inside someone’s house. But once they kicked in, we immediately all wanted to be outside. TV and technology just seemed weird / wrong. 

Social media seems 100000 times more…. Something, than TV. I can’t imagine being on shrooms - even a micro dose - with my iPhone around. 

I partly want to microcose because I’m sick of my iPhone. 

I’m supposed to be finishing an album (I owe my record label another record) and my iPhone is a big distraction. I use it for work a lot and I’m always learning things through it which is great. But I’m having trouble unplugging and working on music. 

Does anyone have the urge to shut off your phones or throw them off a bridge when you microdose? 

Either way, I’m going to find out in about 40 minutes. 

I started with 1/3 of 1 100mg capsule. 

I was always a lightweight. I hallucinate when I’m sober (I assume from years of tripping) a little bit. A little bit more when I smoke weed. And I hallucinate like crazy when I trip. 

My Shroom / LSD visions were legendary. Few people had visions like I did at such low doses. At medium to high doses I entered another dimension. 

Anyways, I’m starting to babble. In short, are smartphones weird on small or medium doses? 

I remember needing to disappear when we tripped. Encountering other humans while tripping was terrifying (but also super entertaining / hilarious when it happened).

2020-05-09 07:36:47,"I have been distance ""dating"" a woman who microdoses shrooms. Is it the cause of odd behavior? Maybe she's not ""micro"" dosing? Is capacity to consent 100%?","Hi, 

I know the real answer to the specific questions here is ""I don't know"" but I'm interested if anyone has speculation about the below situation. I looked in the FAQ and tried a search but no luck. Sorry it's long, I am not a good writer.  

About me for background: I am an experienced user of psychedelics in the conventional ""trip with friends"" way. I have heard about microdosing but have not done much in depth research. I think the world would be better off if the median use of psychedelics increased.  

Recently I've been facetiming with this lady I met on a dating app. I have been noticing some sort of odd things about her. Then yesterday, she mentioned she micro doses and I am wondering if the odd things are possibly attributable to this or just a coincidence. Since I have only known her while she is microdosing I can't see the difference. 

So basically it comes to 

1. discordance in communication

2. mild befuddlement 

**communication**

a bunch of times I have asked one question and she has answered a different one. Like something on the same subject, but defiantly not the question that was asked. 

I have tried rephrasing the question but this generally just elicits further information on whatever she *is* telling me about. My impression is that she perceives that I am not comprehending the things she is telling me. So sometimes she will provide me with more basic background information on the subject so as to catch me up. 

Obviously if this just happened here and there you'd forget about it but the same kind of thing is recurrent. it's sort of frustrating trying to have conversations sometimes. A lot of semi-sequiturs. I see one of the effects of microdosing is ""creativity"" and I wonder if this could be another side of that coin?

If there was a significant language or cultural difference between us I would be tempted to attribute it to that, but we both speak the same dialect/accent of English as mother tongue and have roughly similar cultural contexts. 


**befuddlement**

Another thing I notice occasionally is a confusion with managing to do commonplace tasks. Mostly we just talk so there's not too much opportunity to see this but  for example, one time we were chatting while she was making coffee and she got half way through seemed to be struggling to figure out the second half of it. 

**my thoughts**

Also about me I will say that through my life I have had the privilege of interacting with a wide variety of people whose brains were configured/functioning/conditioned/influenced all kinds of ways. Whatever is going on here is different that anything I've ever comes across. Specifically she does not strike me as psychotic or delusional. I do not think there are any conscious/unconscious attempts at manipulation. Before she told me she was microdosing I was wondering if she was a regular user of *something*. The coffee maker confusion kind of reminded me of when I used to be a very, very heavy daily drinker and I would get myself so blasted I couldn't figure out how to do things like pay a bar bill. But I'm certain I didn't appear so otherwise sober at those times. There are no other obvious signs of intoxication. It's also *somewhat* similar to people I've seen with dementia although the odds of a 28 year old with dementia are obviously very low.  

She seems to be completely oblivious to all this. It's charming how relaxed and un self conscious she is but also strange. Personally I think I would be a bit embarrassed if I forgot how to work a coffee maker in front of someone I've only known a few weeks (or in front of anybody?), but she seemed completely unperturbed. Different strokes for different folks. 

I don't know many details about the actual details of the microdosing but the impression I got was that the first time or two she did get more of a trippy experience. From what I gather that's not supposed to happen right? If that's the case is is really ""micro""? And in terms of sexy times, should I consider her **capacity to consent** at 100%? I've been holding back on the sexy facetimes because I am concerned that later on she might feel that she didn't use good judgement in doing something and feel violated.

I felt complete disappointment that I had never gotten to truly learn any of these individuals the way that I would want them to know me. 

Even the rooms I walked in, I never even thought to look at the gym ceiling and I’m so glad i did. Shits high and interesting as hell. The whole day intrigued me more than any other year had, and I didn’t bother to glance at the clock once. I didn’t feel anxious sitting in my seat in class. I enjoyed the day and took in a lot that I usually don’t. 

Smoking on top of this also may have enhanced it, but overall microdosing is so uplifting for me and confidence as well as mind enhancing. It set a good pathway to the rest of my year.

Since then I’ve been microdosing every 4 days and I’ve really been enjoying it.",39,1054,7,201,0

2022-07-20 11:46:45,Microdosing fucked me up,"Hey ya'al, just sharing my experience. Someone I trusted a lot recommended microdosing to me with 0 warnings about the possible negative side effects. Well I've since found out about every single one of them through bitter experience. Increased anxiety, depression, neuroticism. Came down off of my microdose as if it were a hard drug. Could barely eat or sleep I was so anxious. I missed a week of work because for three days I was lying in bed, couldn't function, couldn't think, could barely respond when my loved ones asked me to pass them the water jug after I was done, it took time for my brain to process what they said.  ALL of my worst mental health problems came back and hit me in the face at fucking 500 mph.
It's been almost a month and I'm still completely fucked. Things I haven't gone through in years. Suicidal ideation, self harm ideation daily, almost all through the day. Yes, I'm safe.

2022-12-15 23:26:20,Interesting Theory.,"I've been microdosing for almost 9 months and just like everyone else I've seen phenomenal results. Here's what I believe is ACTUALLY happening.

What do mushrooms do in nature? They break down organic matter right? 

Before microdosing I took prilosec for 20 years for Gerd. If I went 2 days without one it was a really really bad night for me. I haven't taken one in 5 months. No problems whatsoever.

Forgive me for being graphic here but trips to the bathroom are EXTREMELY consistent in every way possible. I've never had that one day in my life. 

So my Theory is the mushies are breaking down organic matter in my digestive system and correcting it. 

We know the brain uses at minimum 20% if the body's energy via prefrontal cortex. 

So what if the energy that was used to digest my food before microdosing is now available to my prefrontal cortex and that's where the increase in cognitive function comes from. 

We all know what this does for your mind. It's phenomenal! But what if it's more to do with your gut than your mind?

2022-04-08 14:10:38,“Accidentally” gone cold turkey on Zoloft; good time to start MD? Can it help withdrawal symptoms?,"I’ve been on 200mg/daily of Sertraline for many years; I lost my bottle traveling (about 10 days worth) and my crappy teledoc people wouldn’t let me get an early refill unless I made and paid for a separate clinician visit (that’s a whole other post.) that was 8 days ago.

I’ve been wanting to try microdosing for a long time, so I figured now was as good a time as any. I was a psychonaut (shrooms) back before I ever heard of SSRI’s, much less knew I needed them, and it always made me feel fantastic for weeks afterwards- like running a defrag on my brain. So I know I tolerate it well and it works for me.

So right now I’m in the throes of SSRI withdrawal- bad nausea, migraines, overly emotional, anxiety spiraling out of control, the works. I feel like an expired can of pickled assholes. I’m also currently on 200mg Lamotrigine daily as a migraine preventative (not really helping atm) and 30mg twice a day for ADHD (and that’s the only thing keeping me functional right now, lol.)

Any thoughts on making a cold-turkey switch from SSRI’s to MD? The withdrawal symptoms are still going strong after 8 days, and I’m miserably nauseous and cranky and my anxiety is all over the place. I went ahead and tried a tiny bit (one tiny cap? I need to get a scale) in the evening the past two nights, though I don’t expect a fast transition by any means. Should I stick with it and ride it out? Can I expect MD to help alleviate the withdrawal at all? Should I follow a certain dosing/schedule? 

I appreciate any input you guys can give me. It’s not the most ideal circumstances, for sure; but either way I was looking at at least 10 days of being without my Zoloft until my next script. I’m going to go cry in the car on the way to work now while I try not to barf. Thank you, fam!",98,1782,16,337,0

2020-10-13 22:52:32,Three Things I Want To Start Microdosing,"THC - My local dispensary has 2.5mg doses which sound perfect. I had to look on the website because the guy on the phone told me there was nothing that low, I guess microdosing isn’t a popular choice. I opted for pure THC for now but there is also a CBD combination at same or double ratio.
Frequency: Once a day (Plus after psych use)

Psilocybin - I’m thinking of starting at 0.3 grams (upper end of FAQ suggestion) and seeing how it goes. I can always go lower if the dose feels too noticeable - although I may enjoy that part.
Frequency: Every 3 days

LSD - I’m not sure how to measure this one. Should I just cut up a tab into 8 pieces? Is the liquid distributed evenly on the blotter or am I going to screw myself into a full hit one of these times? For now I’m going to skip this and stick to the other 2 until I find a good solution.
Frequency: Once a week

I’ve tried all these drugs but it’s been a long time. I find weed unproductive and addictive at normal dosing. I’m not necessarily looking for anything but I’ve always had a fondness of drugs and don’t mind experimentation - I may be mixing these with alcohol to create unique effects.

First Micro-dose

Cut an 1/8th of a Dalai Lama tab. Someone I know ate it. This is the report as narrated to me, by him. 

+00:25

Waiting to feel something. Not sure what to feel since I've never microdosed. Did one full tab a week ago and then half a tab 3 days ago. 

Feeling like I'll be let down, since the tolerance would be high still. The DL's are pretty strong though, and they were clean. No bitter tastes, no sourness. They may also not be as strong since we got them because they've been exposed to light and air since then, not constant but inevitably it does happen. 

Also, I've just left my house for a drive. 

+00:45

Out on my drive. Feeling slight shivers down my back and goosebumps. Music sounds the same. Def feeling that body thing though. Under arms are a bit sweaty ( sorry for that, this is in the name of science!). I can drive just fine, no confusion or anything. I've just parked my car to stop for something to drink. 

+01:00

Struck up a convo with a random person. Felt normal, didn't feel any extra sociable or anything out of the ordinary. I am generally like this anyway, so wasn't weird or out of place at all. Still typing notes because I want to document this for the community. Sitting in my car now, thinking about what to do. A bit horny :P 

Touching my forehead it feels hot. I don't know how much of these thoughts are fuelled by the dose or just my knowledge that I've dosed and a reaction to that. Placebo effect?

+01:30

As I was waiting for the elevator I felt a bit woozy for a few seconds, as if everything was swaying, then it disappeared. Home now and waiting for more. I guess that there is a 1-5% change in my sight in that I notice that there's something going on. But it's very, very weak. 

I wonder about the benefits of microdosing. I am doing this experiment without any other aids such as marijuana but I am smoking tobacco from time to time. It has no noticeable effects. 

+02:10

I am sitting on the couch and doing things on my phone. All effects have disappeared and I forgot that I've even done a dose. I think this is something that you have to do often and it will allow the effects to be realised, and you need to have a goal in mind so that at the end of the microdosing experiment, however long it may be, you have an outcome or a result. 

So far I am unable to see benefits of microdosing. Thoughts of pushing the dose up to a quarter or even half a tab are crossing my mind. Unfortunately it's around 9:30 pm and there's no point to raising the dose and tripping balls. 

I have no doubts of the strength of the tab as I've done them last week, I also have no doubts based on my research about the decay of the tabs, it shouldn't be as much. I guess it's either the tolerance from last week or maybe the tabs weren't evenly sprayed? Maybe I'm not feeling anything because I'm just that hard? (Joke). 

The experiment continues. 

+03:20

Feeling hot. A/C is on but still feeling it. Also feel a bit hyperactive. Pupils dilated, eyes not red. Don't feel any clearer than usual, some people are over visiting the family so maybe that's what's up. Stepping out to smoke a cigarette. Oh, also I'm not at a loss of appetite. I'm munching as normal, lol. 

I def do feel something, I think it's about tuning your mind and body to understand the effects of the micro-sized dose. I guess from what I'm feeling the first dose is usually just enough for you to be able to grasp what's going on in your head and body. For you to realise that micro-doses will not give you the effects of a full-blown trip but will just give you small feelings of the same and what to expect and what not to expect. 

I guess that this may be the peak since it's around 3 1/2 hours in, and as I am voice typing this note, I am beginning realise how micro-dosing can be beneficial if you understand how to feel for it, or in other words how to feel it rather than what to feel. 

As a sociable friendly person I don't find any extra social or extrovert effects of the trip but I am feeling something. This might take a while to learn.

Once again, the experiment continues.


+06:00
So after my previous post, everything started going to normal again. Totally forgot about the dose last couple hours, so it must have been faint or done. I was able to be totally and absolutely normal as usual.  Upon remembering I typed in this last bit. 

In retrospect, the microdose was alright. Nothing too special I guess and no visible or tangible benefits according to me. Maybe the tolerance was high, maybe the tabs weren't evenly sprayed, maybe they decayed since I've had them, I dunno. 

I think in the future it maybe better to dose on 1/4 tab instead of an 1/8th, it may have a better effect. I haven't given up on microdosing though, I feel there is something hidden in it that we still do not understand. I'll do the 1/4 in a few days and type in a 2nd post.

Microdosing is a different pill. In order to get the benefits, we must be willing to commit to putting in the work. There is no free lunch here. They call it medicine work for a reason. When earnestly embarking on an intentional microdosing journey with Plant Medicine we are embarking on an Epic journey of co-creation.  
 

And if we are doing it right, we won’t fully know where the benefits are coming from. Is it from the microdose? Or is it from the newly adopted meditation practice and contemplative journaling? Or maybe the insightful breathwork? Or it could be from recommitting to regular exercise and eating healthier? Or maybe the benefits come from spending more time out in nature?

How are people that drink small amounts of alcohol different? I guess they are more social and relaxed.

2022-09-08 18:15:30,Manipulating your Spiritual Energy allows you to manipulate your temperature.,"During cold days, I would start the energy flow up then down and in seconds my body would heat up. 

Those days where I do put in the effort to activate my whole energetic(spiritual) body the cold weather doesn't affect me for hours.

At first, I could only maintain a small energetic flow for a few seconds. After research/experience, I learned how to reconnect my whole spiritual body to be able to feel it's energy everywhere and I gained the capacity to maintain it for hours with highly noticeable residual effects lasting 24hours.

We all can easily access and get a grip on this spiritual energy. When activated on its own, it causes goosebumps on us, which, is a blessing in disguise to help you direct and enhance your energy.

How? 

Because Goosebumps also\* activate from positive situations/stimulis (like memories, inspiration, music, love, gratitude, meditation) a euphoric surge of flowing energy, that can be observed as a hot or cold wave flowing underneath your skin which then allows you to understand how to consciously bring it back up with a ""healing/blissful/feel good"" touch to it. 

That is your spiritual energy.

It comes from your Spiritual (energetic) Body/your Mind/Consciousness/Awareness.

2020-08-09 15:42:49,Shrooms - did you experience something similar?,"
Did they tell you to ditch plants?
To enter their realm? And to surrender and get consumed by those funghi?
Did they tell you to keep it a secret? {*}
And you know they will not stop pestering you until you are going to give in and give up your current form.


{*} (Can’t I tell you? Because we are all united in being fellow initiates, human visitors in the realm of funghi.)


I do have chronic pain, trauma and illness and desperately want to escape that flesh in which I’m trapped inside of and whose 
pain I’m unable to not feel as well. 

Since childhood I’ve always been more drawn to the spiritual world that to the real world. 
When I took acid the first time it was not a “new” feeling. I recognized this exogenous something as (a ‚copy’ of) the endogenous something of which I’ve always had a lot of and which made me feel eery around nearly all other people, some more, some less. But if other people would take acid and I’d stay sober It felt like they would ‘visit’ a place which is similar to how I perceive and interact with the ‘world’.


Psychedelic entities are said to be able to help us, but does help always mean to keep us trapped within and to help us dealing with the ‘human/alive’ realm or doesn’t it as well make sense to let us die/lead us to choose the realm of death and decay to live on in the form of funghi and bacteria. To keep on riding the reel of nature’s executives: Consumer— producer — destruents.


They are inviting me into their realm/level/dimension. But I’m not completely sure if they do it in a generous and altruistic (does altruism of the distinct executives of nature even exist?) way or if they get mean if I don’t do what they told me. So, they will try everything. First they start of nicely, with their alluring temptations. If they don’t get what they need they will push hell into your world and force you to go.


I am stuck in between both worlds and it’s hard to choose the ‘right’ side.
Being stuck is not a nice feeling.
I hope it’s going to relieve itself very soon.


I did only microdose (well, somewhere between micro and meso/medium) twice on shrooms and had the experience I’ve just written down. 


Also they sometimes give me the ability to heal my pain, sometimes they aggravate it extremely. I do not fully understand how and why. Maybe they want to ‘push’ those plant toxins out of my body through my cells. Probably sounds weird, but I hope you’ll be able to understand what I meant.

2020-04-06 00:05:52,[Let's Discuss] Microdosing with novel psychedelics,"Good morning!    

I thought it would be interesting to discuss microdosing beyond the traditional LSD and psilocybin.   

I know from some casual experiments a few years ago that a barely perceptible dose of the psychedelic amphetamine 3C-E gives a massive boost to my productivity, mood and also gives all the clarity of thought that I've experienced with microdosed LSD.  

It strikes me as exceptionally unlikely that the most common psychedelic drugs in our culture also happen to be the psychedelic drugs most suited to enhancing daily life through microdosing.  
LSD is excellent for microdosing, but who is to say that it's ideal for the job?  

It would be fantastic to hear about your experiences with productivity-enhancing doses of the newer generations of psychedelics drugs: the 2C series, tryptamines, lysergamides and whatever other interesting psychedelic compounds have found their way into your hands.

2019-02-28 03:41:42,trip report day 3,"I will start posting less frequently after this, I just wanted  to write this down, very interesting day and a half since the last post.

Today was great, the effects are subtle, I did feel a.slight uptick in feeling good. And today was the first day i spent with my fellow students. One big issue I have is a lack of friends and making friends at school has been problematic. But then at lunch I was sitting with a group, including one guy I like but I just cant seem to talk to him, either I dont know what to ask him or I dont care although I do like all of them.

So after a while I realized I care about this guy and want to know what's going on with him. I feel like I decently engaged with him.  And when I thought back over the morning I was feeling the same way about  the others, I was more engaged with others, it feels like some kind of anxiety or block was stopping me from talking to people. It was subtle but it was there and now its disappated. I still dislike the instructor but I did feel like I overlooked her stupid bullshit.

This is hard to say but another weird thing happened. I am bi but I look and act like a very straight guy and my bi side rarely comes out. Lately I seem to have been mildly fascinated with crossdressing and I have wondered what it would be like to be a woman, I do feel like I have a definate feminine side. I never thought seriously about it because I could never pass as a woman. Today I was wearing yoga pants and it suddenly clicked that I could, I should try to seriously crossdress, I could start to transition, I could give HRT a shot, see where it takes me. It felt very real and doable, the thought didnt seem.like a fleeting whim but a real thing I should do.

I should mention one last thing.
Yesterday afternoon I smoked a sativa ""lambs bread"" which is a energizing day time strain. I just smoked this strain last week, exact same amount .4g in the same small water pipe. I was clobbered, it hit me so hard I thought I was in a dream world on the verge of hallucinating and I couldnt move. Wow, I cant recall ever being that high before.

I'm a 31 year old woman suffering from Complex PTSD (traumatic events that occur over and over again), Codependency and what I assume to be abandonment depression.

I'm currently seeing a therapist for CBT therapy and inner child therapy. I have a DBT workbook I am slowly getting through to supplement his therapy.
On top of all this I meditate, take kratom for anxiety, and sometimes attend 12 step CoDa meetings.
I am very curious about microdosing MDMA for my CPTSD flashback management.
Sometimes my flashbacks and abandonment issues get out of hand and ruin my whole day no matter how much I meditate every day or do whatever mindfulness exercise the workbook tells me to do.

2022-03-22 14:46:23,Shrinks are drug pushers! A question and a rant.,"Do others have this experience with their shrink?

I had a tele-med appt with my ~~shrink~~ psychiatrist this morning, who actually got me interested in shrooms as a treatment for depression during our last appt 8 weeks ago. He mentioned he had a patient who did a shroom retreat in Oregon and after a macro dose his depression vanished. I'd heard of shrooms and microdosing as treatment prior to that through intrepid journalists like Chelsea Handler and GOOP but didn't take it seriously.

After he told me about it, I fell down a rabbit hole of research and still haven't come up for air (it's soooo fascinating)! I started md'ing after weaning off Prozac. It's only week 4, so I haven't done a 180 yet - but I'm very optimistic and planning a guided macro-dose in April.

His response to my new strategy was to suggest other antidepressants!!! I was like DUDE! I've been on every single anti-depressant out there and they do not work for me. Treatment-resistant by definition means they don't work. Hello?! He was like there are MAOIs, or tricyclics, or a surgically installed vagus nerve stimulator, etc. ... Um, right thanks. Have you read the overwhelmingly positive results from the psilocybin research?! Not to mention LSD? Ayahuasca, MDMA, etc.?

Wow. They're so programmed to spew the pharma koolaid!  Granted, in the end he said if psilocybin doesn't work, there are other options, so he's not strongly opposed to me trying 🍄 But since it hasn't yet been FDA sanctioned he's not comfortable with it. He also mentioned new research on inflammation and depression - but only in the context of off-label use of a fibromyalgia med administered by injection. WHY? When the scientific research is so promising?

2021-01-26 21:40:13,Absolutely do NOT drive & microdose,"I’ve made this post & thread dozens of times on Reddit and it has always been heavily downvoted. I don’t really care - as long as it has the potential to help atleast one person then I’m happy enough with that. 

Even if it’s an incredibly low dose. Do not drive. Even though your visual acuity, mental clarity and senses are heightened - your driving will be negatively affected by microdosing even if it doesn’t feel like it. Even if your dose is so low that it’s “imperceptible”, I can explain why it’s a bad idea to get behind the wheel.

Even if you’re a very experienced and composed driver, driving is a risk-assessment activity where you are essentially operating on a paranoid state of mind - even if you’re driving in “second-nature”, it won’t feel like paranoia but you are always looking for danger. 

Microdosing can eliminate fear. It puts you in a good-great mood where everything can feel “right” and there’s no issues or worries to be had. Even though you feel sharp, your mood is great, the world is slightly brighter, you will not be in this “paranoid” risk assessment danger-awareness mode while driving - or rather it will diminish this state of mind. 

I’ve driven tons of times while microdosing with zero issue, infact it made the experience of driving probably better because it simply made “everything” feel better. Yet I can tell you right now that the ONLY times in my life that I’ve ever had near-misses in a car, while very few, I can with 100% certainty attribute it directly to the microdosing without fail. 

Go ahead and microdosing and do whatever you want, go hiking, paint, play music, do a sport, whatever - but please seriously reconsider microdosing before operating machinery or driving a vehicle. While you won’t necessarily feel as though you are drunk from alcohol or high from a drug, your judgements can and will be impaired even though it doesn’t feel like it.

Just think and consider the facts: you are taking a seriously potent drug (albeit in a tiny dose), and then operating a vehicle that can travel at high speeds. Even a child would say that this is a terrible idea. Isn’t the goal of microdosing to enhance your life in a small way? Getting into a car wreck has the potential to destroy many lives including innocent ones of people who chose not to take drugs and drive.

I know this isn’t a “fun” topic but if you disagree with this sentiment and instantly downvote it, then all I can do is pray for you aswell.

This study will permit a better understanding about the study of altered states of consciousness, interpretation, and immediate and long-term effects of psychedelics among this understudied group. Our hope is that, ultimately, we will receive thousands of responses to the survey so that we can better understand gender and sexual minorities’ experiences after taking psychedelics, resulting in better clinical protocols and treatment options in the future.

2021-11-21 11:20:08,Microdosing amphetamine!,"EDIT: Not a microdose. Therapeutic dose.

Started to do amphetamine some months ago and it has absolutely changed my life.

I never got an ADD diagnosis because I didn´t show enough symptoms, especially not as a kid. I think it´s pretty common for girls to be underdiagnosed because they don´t necessarily show as many symptoms as boys.

Almost everyone in my family has ADD or ADHD and I have long suspected that I have it because I used to zone out a lot, could not concentrate and had the constant feeling of being restless and tired at the same time.

After starting to take ca 30 mg of amphetamine every morning I feel so energized and good. I feel the right type of energy, not overwhelming, just energetic and calm at the same time. I feel like I can do all the things that seemed impossible before, I can concentrate on things like my art and I can even see myself reading books again (have to try it soon) , my constant mind chatter is minimized and everything is just BETTER. Taking long walks in Nature feels amazing (everything does) and I become more interested in other people. My appetize has changed in the good way, I am less into sweets and more into actual food.

I can talk endlessly about the benefits, just curious, does anyone have similar experiences, with speed or other drugs or medications?

The only negative thing I have experienced about microdosing amphetamine is when I had to quit for a week. The withdrawals are not good. Don´t see myself quitting again in the nearest future as this is an absolute magic medicine for me.

I am so thankful for the black market of drugs when doctors don´t want want to prescribe. Doctors did not want to let me try ADD medications when I was younger and had no history of drug use and neither after I told them about my microdosing and how it has helped me and how I would probably continue doing it. They would rather have people self medicate it seems than to do it more safely with medications. Not a big surprise though, I have heard it´s hard to get stimulants prescribed.. has anyone else got denied of prescriptions?",24,2090,2,378,0
2021-10-31 01:18:49,"shrooms arent what i expected, advice wanted plz","hi guys i have a question i would really appreciate it if someone would answer :) 

so basically i took shrooms today i took 0.5g of golden teacher and penis envy chocolate and i took it for mental health purposes. im a pretty spiritual person and thats exactly why i wanted to try shrooms, i meditate and go for runs and have a therapist etc i just wanted to do it for healing. but it felt like a party drug and thats definitely not what i wanted. i was SO out of it and laughing till i cried. dont get me wrong it was fun but if thats what shrooms are then idk if its for me. weed felt more healing than this :/

you can skip this part just a little extra info: i mostly want to microdose and take shrooms because i havent felt basically any empathy/love since i was a kid (like elementary school) i know thats hard to believe but its true. im so apathetic and unemotional. it doesnt go away :( i dont even form bonds with my best friends anymore. i was expecting to cry and process my emotions and maybe feel empathy again but that didnt happen

my questions are:

im planning to start microdosing (golden teachers) and .5 hit me hard, so what dose should i take? i was going to take .1 and i still want to try out microdosing

is microdosing even worth it then? i know its not a miracle cure, ive researched it for two years until i could get my hands on some shrooms, but if shrooms seem like a party drug to me then whats microdosing gonna be like?

i have alot more shroom chocolate. should i wait awhile and try again? ive heard trips are different each time

2018-01-04 07:37:41,PSA: You CAN get HPPD from microdosing,"I see very mild tracers even over a month after taking my last microdose(or any other drug aside from infrequent caffeine use). The tracers I've seen on a 10ug microdose were way more intense than I've seen on either of my +400ug trips. I've never abused LSD trips in very high doses or high frequency so the HPPD is all microdosing, and I hadn't tripped for many months before experiencing HPPD. 

**Me seeing visual distortions during microdoses was my warning that I failed to acknowledge.** If you see visual distortions, lower your dose if you do not want to risk HPPD. All my doses have been 10-12ug which i would take at a maximum of once every three days, I did not believe these were high doses at the time.

Other factors that i believe might have exacerbated the effects of HPPD are sleep deprivation and the daily use of multivitamins with 1667% the DV for vitamin B12 and 200% the DV for Vitamin C. I would take a microdose to allow myself to stay up for 12 hour night shifts in which I stared at a computer screen most of the time, which I know see is a misuse of microdosing, but the visual distortions were there before I started doing that.

Today he decides taking 20ug in the morning at 10:00 before school.And another 20 ug today again at 6:00 pm.

2018-07-13 08:39:18,Amphetamine + LSD,"Two days ago, I had a chance to try amphetamine, my friend made a mix with distilled water and we used nasal spray bottle (the quantities are not clear to me). We took some in the evening and were doing an all nigh trip around the city, then came back home at 3am and were talking till I have to leave for work for 9am.

It was my first time trying speed, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was awesome, I don't remember the last time I could be awake for 24 hours and still be so energetic (though we did use up half the spray thourgh out the night).

Then before going to work I decided to add LSD to the mix. I was microdosing it for a while (about 4 months now) at about 12ug, but decided to go for 16ug this time.

The experience was amazing, I was feeling very social, confident and productive, I don't remember the last time when I was feeling so confident about what am I doing at any given task. Any task given to me  I took with an ease and didn't hesitate to start working on it right away. I was feeling as though microdosing LSD has kinda wore of on me or I just got used it so much that I didn't even notice any positive effects and productivity wasn't as great, but when I tried this I felt motivated like never before, conversing with people was so easy, because I could actualy concentrate on what they are saying and listen. And there was this slight feeling of euphoria lingering, or maybe just general hapiness thourgh out the day, but at not point in time I felt overwhelmed (like sometimes I was when drinking double espresso and top of LSD md). So in total I was awake for 40 something hours, and felt like I could stay awake for more, but I decided that I even though this day was amazing, I should lay to bed and when I did I fell asleep right away (I was a bit anxious about going to bet, because I thought that I won't be able to fall asleep, because I felt like there was enough energy in me left, but I guess I was wrong).

The next day feel like I am back to complete normal. Kinda miss that ability to concentrate like before though.

I will try to find out how much speed was there in that bottle, and maybe try to calculate the actual dosage with each spray, because I'm interested in trying this again some time, but I want to be more systematic about it.

Anyone else tried this combo? Maybe there are some good ways of combining these two substances.

2020-06-03 00:13:45,Microdosing Meth - Taming the dragon,"I was careful in reading the description of this thread before posting. And then I started thinking about all of the reasons why I should not post this all of my hangups insecurities second guesses and so on. But I've been microdosing shrooms for about 2 weeks and I see things a little differently. First let me say the obvious.. methamphetamines BAD... Usually. That's the narrative right? Most folks don't know that methamphetamines are still a leg al but controlled substance use to treat narcolepsy and reportedly ADHD in its severest form. As someone that probably has the severest form of ADHD I find this difficult to believe but there may be some shrink somewhere right now handing out scripts for methamphetamines. (DM me Dr feelgood winkwink).
So is it possible to microdose methamphetamines? Yes believe it or not. Spoiler alert! My experience with methamphetamines has overwhelmingly been negative... I wasn't exposed to it my entire life till I was 47 years old. However since the age of six I have been on and off various psychostimulants for ADH. I've had addiction issues with stimulants specifically cocaine when I was younger and abused the prescription grade amphetamine salts otherwise known as Adderall also sporadically.
With that backdrop, What I have found and what I want to share is my experience with methamphetamines and how it affects me and may impact other people in a positive way. So the modality of how I introduce methamphetamines into my system almost like clockwork can usually predict the outcome of my experience. But for the grace of God I have never banged it (shot up)... But everything else I've done. If I smoke it and I have enough of it two things eventually happen. I fight or I flight. Metaphorically or literally having enough of it will get me so spun up it's never fun at the end. 
Eating it makes me high. Too high to do anything but get naked and have relations. But snorting it always seems to temper my desire to do excessive amounts of the drug and also unequivocally to gives me the most benefit. Let me define benefit. I'm awake I'm alert I'm focused I'm confident I'm engaging and upbeat. Like my problems with any other substance I have attempted to build upon the initial hook amphetamines give you and go overboard but it doesn't do anything for me. As long as I don't have a pipe I and the adult version of who I typically am or who I've typically been most of my life. It does affect appetite and increases my blood pressure slightly but otherwise I can only report that the people I've worked with and the people I love and have close to note and have unsolicitedly commented on positive ways.
So how do I do it? I'm the guy that buys the 50-lb bag of kidney beans to save $0.04 per pound so purchasing an ounce for $200 ( pre-corona era..PCE) can easily last me three months. When I juxtaposed micro dosing psychedelics with me th the increase in focus that amphetamines would give my otherwise ethereal attention laser intensity. I recently moved to the Pacific Northwest and the combination of these two substances on a routine walk in the woods has been nothing short of magnificent. I've had the ability to do let the meth run out of my system and just see what shrooms would do with that experience. What I have found is if there are only two drugs left on the planet I would absolutely shockedly choose shrooms over methamphetamines. I don't think I would ever have expected that. The spirituality I experience in nature micro dosing shrooms 0 Trump's whatever diesel-powered amp ride I get off methamphetamines. But the combination of the two? Miraculous is all I can say. By the way I'm pretty sure when I I attempt to post this on the meth thread this novel will become a meme...",36,3755,6,663,0

With mushrooms, even microdosing, I can realize I'm more relaxed, not energized. The mind is indeed sharp (to insightful, inner thoughts, maybe creative things, but I haven't tried solving problems, puzzles, etc), although it's only perceivable in small, not micro, doses.

Up until this moment microdoses (up to 0,5g) were a waste of shrooms and time for me. But I loved the small doses (1g - 1,5g)!

&#x200B;

My background - I don't have anxiety/depression etc. now although I was addicted to marijuana for a few years which led to a pretty severe depression that I was able to pull myself out of using some friends, my wife and some luck, but that was back in 2017. Haven't smoked pot since and don't really have any interest in it, since all it does is make me depressed and suck the ambition, life and happiness out of me. I'm glad it helps other people though. Since then, I'd say >80% of my days are generally good days and bad days don't usually get me down much. My depression during my pot addicted years was really severe and nothing I've felt since getting ""sober"" from pot comes even close to the depression I felt then. I exercise pretty regularly, in my last year of grad school which has gone pretty well except the depression part lol, have good friends, an awesome wife etc. I'm also pretty outgoing and don't get social anxiety in public. I recognize that not everyone's life is like this and feel pretty privileged to be in the position I'm currently in. So that's me without microdosing I guess.

&#x200B;

I just micro dosed 0.1g of cubes that I grew and it was pretty intense in the morning. I have a low tolerance for psychedelics anyway and I felt like colors were stronger and I really liked the texture of different things. Now, I think the majority of that is gone and I mostly feel energetic. Sometimes I feel like I have an apprehension to doing things like at work/exercise etc. more out of general laziness over anything and none of that is really there. I feel pretty excited to start things. Not sure if this is placebo or actually the micro dose coming through, but the intensity in the morning though was definitely the cube. That's been my day so far, I'll probably keep updating this post as the day goes on and I feel different things.

Edit 1: Had a few conversations with people who were helping me set up experiments at work etc (I'm in science). I'm usually pretty engaged when I talk to people and felt like I was even more so today. Still feeling productive - feels almost similar to phenibut for those who have experience taking that, in a way.

I have MD'ed for 3 weeks, Fadiman protocol. .15mg of shrooms (Golden Teacher strain). Yes I may be impatient but theres really no observed changes whatsoever. i know micro supposed to have no noticable effects but for me 3 week seems to long for a wait. My intention btw is just to be genuinely happy, not a sulking princess whose default mode is RBF. For the record I am currently not clinically depressed. I just want to move up from neutral if that makes sense

So I decided to minidose hours ago, specifically 0.3 grams or 300 mg. for context i have not tried anything beyond that. Here is a quick summary

* T+0 instant bodyload within 2 minutes. I am working working from home but already rendering resignation. I literally have no tasks anymore aside from my availability in case anything is needed from me, so  not worried about that. i walked around, lied down, selected some music
* T+1 i felt hunger like extremely. i think this is come up? and then i became anxious all of a sudden like sudden movement makes me jump. the smears on the wall made me scared for some reason. my pupils were dilated
* T+2 I was talking with my supervisor on teams (chat) and she brought up transitioning workload. I said to myself, ""what workload? i am out of here in 2 weeks.."" and i fuckin laughed. i repeated the word workload and laughed and laughed. i dont know whats funny about that, it doesnt make sense right? but its funny af. after this the giddy feeling. continued on
* T+2:30 I was selecting songs on spotify suited for the event. like some shamanic upbeats or lofi or pink Floyd whatever, only to find out that i dont have to change my usual music! i listened to andrew bird and sang with him as i cook lunch. i dont normally do that??
* T+3:30 still listening to music. komm, susser tod (eva) makes me happy even if it typically makes me sad. and typing this now because i dont want to forget the experience. i have Terrible memory.

I will research more on minidosing, perhaps i can do that once a week. idk would that be okay, or is mini or museum dose only short lived and micro is more benefitial long term? like ive read that we can do dosing experiments to see which is suitable. after all, this is a plant and not some antibiotic.. apologies again for the incoherent post!

2022-06-16 14:24:16,"Microdosing Marijuana, Whole Flower Edibles Vs. Distillate Edibles are NOT THE SAME","Firstly, just wanted to say how shockingly different in potency edibles are when they are made from whole flower vs distillate. 9mg of a whole flower edible will get me nice perfectly high and last like 12 hours after dosing. 9mg of a distillate edible I will feel something very very slight and never the steady euphoria nor peak which you feel with the whole flower edible. With the whole flower edible when you take it you won't feel it for like 3-4 hours and it won't peak till a few hours after that. With the distillate edibles it hits you right away and stays the same level the whole time but does not last nearly as long as the whole flower edible. I will tell you one thing though, mixing both of these makes the best experience. The distillate edible though weaker enhances the whole flower edible high.....remember the distillate edible is vastly weaker than the whole flower one like MUCH weaker. I started taking like 8-9mg of whole flower edible with 100mg distillate gummy indica, 100mg distillate gummy hybrid, 100mg distillate gummy sativa. During the duration of the 12 hour high I re-dose the 300mg of distillate gummies as needed when I feel a drop in my high and it picks it right up a to a nice steady level. My question was, how often do you think I should dose the whole flower edible to maintain a peak high without a drop-off?

I have not heard him discuss it yet, it is just a small segment at the end of the episode, that is coming up after the commercial lol, but I am curious to see what he has to say. Regardless of any opinions of Dr. Phil, he does work with a group of experts in various fields, and the point here is that it is on TV, on the currently highest rated talk show, making it into mainstream media in a big way, which means it is one step closer to eventually becoming accessible treatment for all.

&#x200B;

***Edit to report TL:DR from what was said: <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><<>*** *Ok, this episode was actually from 5/13. Here's a link to the episode:*[*https://youtu.be/PZwwX7AVmQU*](https://youtu.be/PZwwX7AVmQU)

It is undeniable that people have reported really positive therapeutic effects from the use of psychedelics. It is important to do it in a controlled environment. Much more research is needed. Research is somewhat tricky because you can't really do a ""double-blind"" study on psychedelics (can't argue that lol), but there are about 50 known studies going on currently, and Johns Hopkins is getting seriously involved in conducting research in this area. He also mentions that how it works, or the exact Agent of action, is not yet known, BUT if you look in any physician's desk reference and look up psychotropic medications - as in all the currently approved prescription medications - the vast majority of them say ""unknown."" Therefore, having all the answers does NOT disqualify this from consideration. In essence, he is undoubtedly a proponent for research on this topic. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><

&#x200B;

It was a very brief discussion, but the way it was discussed had a very ""pro consideration"" vibe. The guests on stage were all proponents for therapeutic use of psychedelics. I think this is a clear nod to the progress being made in this area, and a powerful push for acceptance! I feel like it is a positive sign that we are on our way to eventually having legal access to psychedelics in a controlled environment. I mean, look how far we've come with Ketamine, and that has literally saved *so many* people's lives.

&#x200B;

\- On a side note, and this is my personal opinion, but one of the guests was a clinical therapist or something that stated their therapy trial required a patient to be in a room with two therapists for 8 hours in order to break through trauma in their lives...I mean, I am definitely all for microdosing and psychedelics for use in therapy in general, but - for the love of God - please do not lock me in a room with two therapists for 8 house while I'm tripping! (or even if I'm not tripping! lol) Sounds like an absolute nightmare!! Maybe that would work for some people. Maybe that is what some people need, but as for me - No Thanks!  If they feel it is going to take 8 hours, at least break it up into more than one session. Let them trip for 2 hours, then give them something to make them sleep through the rest of the ""trip"" and continue in a separate session or something. I think that would be traumatizing in itself tbh. I would literally need therapy to overcome that ""therapy."" <*shivers>*

Note, when I had that experience, I started with 300uG and was not experiencing much, and about 1.5 hours after I was given another 160uG, which then did give me psychodelic experience.

I am a 6+ year daily toker (in evening). I have noticed that if I smoke some strong Cannabas (37%thc) a couple of hours after microdosing, it will 'enhance' the effect and allow me to experience the psychodelic experience more.   

Has anybody tried combining the two medicines?  Specifically I was thinking about with the Cannabis of microdosing with edibles.  Most edibles seem to be in the 100mg range, although some are now showing up with 10mg edibles.   Would love to hear if anybody was able to let these medicines work together in this way.

2020-02-10 20:11:00,How does a bioresonance test detect MD-ing,"Today I had a bioresonance test. I wanted to find out the root causes of my fatigue and headaches, that are the reasons I started MD-ing 8 weeks ago. Today I'm on the 7th day a tolerance break.

Bioresonance is a type of therapy used in holistic or complementary medicine. It  uses a machine to measure the frequency of energy wavelengths coming  from the body. Those measures are then used to diagnose disease. Today was not my first time, so I trust the method fully.

And guess what, shroom presented themselves in a wide open crown chakra. Which made me smile and I find it wonderful. I knew that somehow it would show, but had no idea how. But it is so obvious. We couldn't spot any negative sign of taking them. The machine would have measured them. 

My aura was detected as clean and full. A little small though, indicating a lower energy level than normal. I think results would have been different if I was doing it before I started MD-ing. Because I already feel a lot of improvement.

Fatigue and headaches seem to originate from a blocked liver function. Originally I thought I was getting into peri-menopause.",42,1123,7,200,0

However this would mean I have to bring it on the plane at which point I become an international drug smuggler whether I like it or not. 

HOWEVER acid tabs are so tiny and easy to hide, as well as not picked up by drug sniffing dogs or anything afaik so it should logistically be a cakewalk to have it in my check-in bag.

2018-11-25 15:20:25,Clarifying Some Things,"I don't frequent this r/microdosing a lot but recently I've landed on this forum and seen comments that people are not getting good results from extracting blotters. Of course you won't get efficient extraction if you just stick a blotter in a vial of water or vodka!  


Especially in the case of 1P-LSD and ALD-52 (as the L-tartrate salts), the solubility in water is very poor. These molecules are very peculiar, theory would predict high solubility in a polar solvent like water but this is not the case. Even in the case of methanol, the solubility is only 10g per litre at room temperature. Ethanol is worse, water even worse. LSD L-tartrate is an exception here, it's solubility is quite high in water, methanol and ethanol.  


Anyway this is besides the point, you don't need to extract blotters to microdose. You can simply take a blotter and cut tiny slithers, you can easily cut down to 1/20th this way with some nail scissors. Contrary to popular belief, blotters are not made by 'pipetting' so there is little risk of uneven distribution. Blotters in bulk are made by soaking a large stack in a solution of the active compound. These are then left to dry. This is especially true with all the novel lysergamides on the RC market (made by one supplier).

&#x200B;

If you do want to extract blotters then you will only get efficient extraction if you sonicate. Forensic analysis of blotters usually involves sonication for this reason.

2018-09-03 15:47:29,Using DMT md and modafinil?,"Okay, I am fairly new to this world. Started MD LSD about 6 weeks ago and really like it. 

What I like best is my ability to see though my old beliefs and drop my old mental patterns. 

Most days I do some ""spiritual work"" (meditation, focusing and CBT) and have found the LSD made progress in these many fold more effective. LOVE it. 

Recently started trying modafinil. Also LOVE it. Makes me put aside all the fancy thinking and take action. (not traditionally a strength of mine;  ADHD) 

I love both drugs but they don't love each other. Puts me I  a weird head space if I take them together. I feel an urgency not to decide about what it means to be stuck when there isn't a good reason for it. lol. 

Thus my question....What if I took a MD (or two) of DMT in the morning just to facilitate my ""spiritual work"" and then the Moda so that I kick ass at getting shit done during the day? 

The tentarive plan is that I would not take the Moda one or two days a week and would skip the DMT too but on those days do a decent sized MD of LSD, maybe 20mg (I feel it at 5mcg and am a little to high at 15. Do 7mc every other or third day currently) 

So 5 days a week. DMT and modafinil after it wears off. 2 days a week LSD. No DMT no modafinil.

Never touched DMT and there is scant info about MD but my theory is that maybe I could get my spiritual work done without mixing LSD and modafinil which just isn't good. 

Does anyone have an informed opinion? Or a resource for more info?

I was wondering if people have microdosed using edibles/decarbed cannabis before and if they had any suggestions on dosing sizes to start at? 

I have a fairly accurate scale and the first one was 0.10g the second was 0.15g.

Would microdosing be recommended with this scenario? (self.microdosing)

submitted 1 minute ago by mark983

At 16 i had a breakdown initially caused by worry awaiting exam results, poor social life, various other personal things such as i spent a lot of time on porn and internet chat rooms and other dubious things. I had quite a lot of arguments with family.

The breakdown actually started as paranoia after several sleepless nights and worrying about little things, e.g. downloading pirated mp3s and being told off by someone on a chatroom who threatened to report me and that to expect a letter from the police / fbi (this was 1999 and i was 16).

I knew these things weren't likely and not really going to happen but still could not control the anxiety, stress and worry.

At one point I was so convinced I was going to be arrested and that I had upset Tony Blair while watching the news I went to a psychiatric hospital. The conversation was weird and I can't remember. I was convinced I was being punished and had no understanding of this hospital or whether I was in prison or my family were allowed to visit etc. I did not trust any staff in there initially and thought they were going to hurt me at the time.

I actually thought that the blood test was done to inject poison ink into me after misreading a sign in the medical room (it said something about Only Use Black Ink On Tests or something weird. I actually cut my arm quite bad as I moved.

I tried to run away from the hospital and was sectioned and eventually recovered.

I had a couple of other horrible incidents like this where I was in hospital 2-5 months. None as bad as that but still bad experiences. Even though I enjoyed therapy somewhat I found the environment weird.

The other experiences were possibly due to binge drinking while on antipsychotics and arguments about whether I could do this or not. 

At one point the dose of medication was confusing and I was self-medicating to work out which dose my prescriuption should be. I had thyroid problems and was almost falling asleep at work at one point and sat at the call centre drinking strong Energy drinks even after a good nights sleep.

So after many years of antipsychotics and 2 years of antidepressants I started to work once again with the psychosis team. They have noted no recent signs of psychosis, or schizophrenia and I decided after an aspergers diagnosis to stop the antipsychotics.

I am now slowly reducing the antidepressants I have still had anxiety problems and stress. I still have sleepless nights and get overly guilty when I overspend or do something regrettable.

It was 8 months ago I got an aspergers diagnosis and am now seeing a counsellor and looking into nootropics after I come off of the antidepressants. I now focus on health and vitamins.

However guilt still hits me as far too strong an emotion. If I ever make a mistake or upset somebody even in a minor way or I get lectured by someone I get very worked up and start to think about it too much. I had bad anxiety and panic attack after a friend had a go at me for being addicted to video games.

I have decided at this point after various therapists that I do still enjoy gaming as a hobby and continue this.

I am however looking to improve life and move forward. I meditate, do fitness, learning the guitar, cooking more. Learning about nutrition.

I've also bought some interesting books and want to watch more creative films and study documentaries on creative interesting topics.

I love music , many genres mostly alternative rock and am passionate about many eras but lately 60s music has fascinated me.

I am overwhelmed by the story of LSD and whether it was banned for the right reasons or an overreaction.

2017-10-18 11:00:15,I wanna start microdosing,"Hey everyone. I'm thinking of starting with microdosing magic mushrooms, as a solution for my anxiety issues.

I do have a question. I'm thinking of buying 10 grams of mushrooms, then deviding it by 20, and then put .5 grams in capsule. Mushrooms often work around 4 hours for me, and then I eat around 10 grams. Should I take a few capsules a day to keep the effects going? How do people do this?

2017-05-30 22:21:03,Zero effect from first microdose - can I up the dose tomorrow?,"So my original plan 10-15mcg every 4th day (Tue, Fri, Mon, Thu, and so forth)  just like Fadiman suggests. 

I got these really tiny blotters they are supposed to be around 150mcg but I guess they could very well be between 75mcg to 125mcg just as well. 

I took 20mcg via volumetric method this morning.
But you could say 10-20mcg range (if the blotter was just half the supposed dose) 

Took this morning like 12 hours ago. Half an hour before breakfast. 
Felt absolutely nothing today. The day sucked just like any other day if not more. 

I didn't feel even the slightest improvement in my anxiety, depression or lack of focus. Nothing at all. My day wasn't any 'little bit better' as some would say microdosing makes them feel. 

To put in perspective, even when I drink  a small cup of coffee feels really good. Lifts my depressions temporarily and allows me to focus. But microdosing today felt like totally zero improvement. 

Should I wake up tomorrow and try say 30mcg (which if the blotters are ubderdosed would equal to 15mcg)  or should I wait to be 2 days off and try again only on the third day my second dose?

2020-03-13 17:01:47,I don't think microdosing MDMA is a good idea and I think it should/could be replaced by taking an antidepressant (SSRI).,"I've seen a guy talk about how fantastic he felt after microdosing MDMA. I mean, of course he felt fantastic, it's releasing serotonin and other ""happy chemicals"" (in a nutshell), but as a past MDMA user, I'm deeply afraid of what microdosing on a regular basis could do to one's brain. (How about microdosing heroin? I bet it feels great.)

Immediately it came to my mind: If he felt good microdosing MDMA, and it resolved some of his health issues, it's possible that he would obtain the same benefit by taking an antidepressant (SSRI/SNRI). They also ""raise serotonin"" but in a sustainable way (by blocking reuptake instead of releasing and destroying it). I know because I take an antidepressant and the effects are there. It indeed reminds me of MDMA because the basic feeling is the same I'd say, but of course much more subtle.

So I beg everyone to consider this idea before damage has been done.

EDIT:

I may not be right and I admit I can't say for sure that microdosing MDMA is bad, but I really don't see why anybody would want to risk their brain and mental health by microdosing a substance that's highly controversial and known to create ""brain damage"" in normal doses with repeated use.

EDIT2:

There were some comments about the downsides of antidepressants. Well, everything has a downside and it's not the same for all the people, but the fact is, if you want to tinker with your serotonin for whatever reason, antidepressants are certainly a viable solution, and from a harm reduction standpoint they are very safe. They are prescribed clinically and there are many studies done over the course of years and for the majority of people, there aren't many problems associated with them. Even if there are some side effects, they might be worth the benefits, as many people testify. But of course, if you go to r/antidepressants, you'll see the worst stories ever, because people who visit these kind of subreddits ofter have issues which is the reason why they post. There are also many great stories, don't forget that. I don't deny any issues with them, I just want you to have a balanced perspective.",121,2123,21,369,0

2021-10-12 06:25:26,"Not about microdosing, but I value the community's input. I have a question about macrodosing after a period of psilocybin mushroom addiction last year.","Holy fuck, my meds wore off and now I'm in ADHD paralysis. I spent like 30 mins writing a post for this sub and then completely deleted it because I realized I shared so much shit I didn't need to share.

Okay, so let me keep this as short as my brain will allow:

* Had a serious problem with psilocybin mushrooms last year from October 2020 - Jan 2021.
* I was tripping way too often, from spacing it out to only 7 days between trips to as little as 5 on a regular basis. I even tripped 2 days apart.
* I probably tripped about 17 times in the span of 3 months. That's an average of about 5.29 days between trips. Pretty fucking horrendous, if you ask me.
* The reason I stopped tripping in January is cuz of the most fucking terrifying trip of my life that had me in a total psychotic state. It was for the best, and I'm grateful that it happened now.
* A few months later I tried microdosing. I did it for a week. I felt like I didn't need it anymore. It actually helped me feel like I don't *need* psychedelic drug experiences, but I can still *have* them. It's just that I can live with or without them and my happiness won't depend on that.
* Got diagnosed with ADHD in July after my life was on the verge of falling apart and the meds have helped save my life.
* I'm in a much better place now and generally a lot more hopeful about life. I'm in a complete financial mess due with a lot of student debt due to my ignorance of my own mental disorder, but I still feel hopeful for the future despite the obstacles that may come soon.

Here's my question:

* My friend wants to trip in December (not for sure happening) with me and a few others, and I would love to do that, but I'm honestly wondering if I got back into infrequent tripping, would I be okay?
* Did I do irreversible damage? I feel pretty sound of mind, if I'm being honest, but I think everyone wants to think that about themselves. So, who knows, but I try to be self-aware.
* I don't really have a ton of concern, but I thought I'd run it by some insightful people like those on this subreddit.
* I tried microdosing like 10 days ago and had an AMAZING experience  (I took 0.08 g). I was laughing and I felt so warm and fuzzy inside. I tried to take it go to sleep, it didn't exactly work, but that's okay because I felt so nice. I only did that because microdosing could make me super sleepy, so don't judge.

Okay, I still wrote more than I had hoped. I have been writing this post for like an hour now. Should have waited until tomorrow when I had my meds were in effect lol. Would have taken me like 10 mins. The cost of having ADHD. :(

Also didn't want to post on r/shrooms, they're always posting pics about growing and I just feel like text posts just don't really get attention.",152,2761,24,541,0

I know when I’m hearing that I’m tripping balls, and I’ve had some crazy thoughts while hearing that sound. 


———————


Frequencies are at the root of all matter. Matter is oscillating energy. 

Check your vibe right now. Are you low or high? 

I was talking with a Christian who said that to be filled with the Holy Spirit (777) means you are unaffected by the lower demons (666). To obtain Holy Spirit, you must forgive your sins (release blocked patterns) and pray (admit and search for love and guidance).

I know, it seemed a bit crazy, but the reoccurring point I keep coming back to is low energy vs high energy, how you go up and down based on your actions, and how being on a higher frequency is the purest well-being. Lower energy beings are jealous of higher ones, and wonder how they are so “confident” and on course.

I tried Kava for the first time the other night in Maui. Kava lowered my frequency like crazy, and everyone in the kava bar seemed stuck, wanting to zone out, and slumped. Very similar to weed. I am never going to use that stuff or Kratom ever again.

Sunlight, being active, being around other high energy individuals, eating all natural foods, having “pure” morals, and meditation/prayer/processing the past all seem to raise the frequency and guide you to your ultimate “mission”.

The happiest and most confident people are riding high, and everyone can pick up on a high frequency individual. And a low one can bring down the whole group.

Safeguard your frequency, and do things that raise it while avoiding things that lower it. I’ve been riding low for years smoking weed every time I feel the energy surging, but I believe all of us who are riding low can completely change reality if we find what makes it rise, and keep letting it get higher and higher.

The power, whatever you want to call it, is what guides us in life in every moment. Depression is real, but it’s far from a permanent illness. Some of us have just fallen low, and the lowness stagnates everything. Get rid of everything lowering it, and as it rises you’ll start doing things that make it rise more and more.

There are many religions/methods/programs with rules/systems to find paths to higher frequencies. Find one that works for you (the holy Bible/Buddhism/wim hof method/etc) or self observe and watch closely what things affect you positively or negatively. Stealing, cheating, lying, betraying, ignoring, drugs, stuffing yourself etc have never felt raising to me. Humans have long figured out what works and what doesn’t, and written it down in many ways. It almost seems the current “matrix” or system, especially in USA, is promoting everything to lower ourselves. 


I love you all. I’m sorry for being self focused so much. I hope you are all having a happy and wonderful time. If not, it’s not far away anymore.",28,3217,4,555,0

I was at home very relaxed and it seemed like the perfect time. Besides from heightening my awareness of my surroundings, it removed brain fog, lifted my mood slightly, didn’t feel anxious and just felt a positive experience overall. Today on my second dose I took 60mg of the same shroom, and after about 50 minutes I started to feel anxious. I sat down to do some work and my mind just felt a bit scattered and it has been hard to concentrate on work throughout the day. Its not horrible, but it definitely hindered my attempt at a productive day of work. Right now I just feel like I need to rest. What should I do? Should I take a break for one week? Should I try again on Friday and going back down to 50mg?

I’m planning on doing either psilocybin or lsd today - I have experience doing lsd twice (1tab each time), both times were wonderful- the world was a little better and a little brighter. I’ve done shroomies twice (about 1g) but never really felt anything. I had originally planned on doing lsd today and saving the shrooms for another time. However, my boyfriend and best friend think trying shrooms is more the play- but, they are both also scared of lsd. I’ve been reading through a lot of the posts on here and see great feedback for both. 

I’ve seen that lsd is maybe a little more controllable, and more externally located. 

And I’ve seen that mushrooms are a bit more trippy and internally located, introspective etc. 

I’m looking for feedback on how you would describe your experience with either one. Descriptive words, examples, etc.

The idea is a product for people new to micro-dosing that would help guide them through how to optimize the experience and have a productive day/week after micro-dosing.

Obviously Im new to the space and to micro-dosing in general, but from you all, Im curious to hear if you think something like this would've made it easier or more comfortable to dip your toe in the world of psychedelics?

2022-04-09 03:09:25,eye spasms and nosebleeds after MDing. Meaning ?,"I've been experiencing spasms in my left upper lid ever since I started microdosing on psylocibyn. I have a feeling that it's connected. 

The eye twitching started on transition day aka on the second day after my first microdose. I took 1g of truffles in the morning, and had the same dose two more times during the same week. I stopped MDing on my 2nd week but the twitching didn't stop. It happens every now and then during the day, lasts for a few seconds and isn't painful. 

There is one other thing worth mentioning, I would also find a bit of blood in my mucus when blowing my nose. This isn't very new nor alarming for me bc I tend to experience very minor nose bleeds every now and then due to cold dry weather, stress etc,. But this has been consistent ever since the microdose. I thought it best to mention it, in case you see any connection.

I don't have any health problems, or at least none that I'm aware of. I do have seasonal allergies, weigh about 48 kg (105pds) and am five feet.

After that, I wondered what would happen when I play Valorant and so I did. I opened the game and didn't wear headphone but rather played some funky songs from the 70s. Full volume with bass and literally my room is like booming but I didn't felt that. I just realize how loud it is when the trip is done. the game started and ended with me being a MVP of the game. So after an hour I played another round and made won it again with me being the top player. The whole trip was just fun and me dancing while it's post-game all the time. The thing that made me and my friend got curious is that I didn't get any hallucination or the usual stuff that you'll feel when taking that amount of dose. I can't say I was more focus while playing. There was at some points yes, but I just remembered that I was just having fun while playing the game and listening to some songs.

It went down pretty quick after 2-3 hours. My usual time when taking huge doses is 5 hours. This was my second huge dose as well. The first huge dose I took was 2.5g of dried shrooms and it was a blast. I experienced everything to spiritual awaken and just being happy. Also that first time, I experienced physical and mental effects.

Another question that me and my friend got us curious is that does shrooms get less potency when not stored correctly? Because maybe that's one of the reason I didn't feel the usual stuff. Also after taking the 1.5g of dried shrooms, I didn't felt the feeling of flying or the body being light as well. I felt that on the first dose.

2021-09-10 12:07:27,Procrastination is impossible with this Primordial Divine Wisdom! Read now to never procrastinate again!,"Who is procrastinating? There is no one procrastinating. It is only a thought that interprets what is to be procrastination. Do not identify with that thought nor any thought, emotion, sensation, perception or experience for that matter, and there God alone is. It is only the conditioned mind that knows what procrastination is, what you truly are has nothing to do with that mere thought, hallucination. God is aware of God alone, there there is only the timeless which sees only itself. It is not conditioned to see through the concept of 'me' 'i am the body-mind' 'i am the thinker of thoughts' 'i am the doer of actions'; it just is the infinite which is taking the shape of whatever appears to be, just like when you go to sleep and your mind takes the shape of a dreamed universe, it is only your mind that is there, and that infinite mind doesn't know what procrastination is. You are simply seeing through false concepts rather than seeing from and as the timeless reality that truly is. When you believe the thought that there is a personal you, and that you can procrastinate, and it is procrastinating; then it appears to you experientially as if it is true, even though it is only because you have identified with thoughts that truly have nothing to do with reality. They are utterly disconnected, utterly delusional, they are of no value at all. All value and that is an understatement is the Self alone, therefore it is to be realized and abided as. The same it is with emotions and sensations, literally disregard them, they have absolutely nothing to do with reality. They are utterly delusional. Just seeing this will allow for authentic expression because you are seeing the illusory to be illusory and that is only possible from Truth. What will help you realize this very powerfully is psychedelics also. You will see how it is to be totally your self without any identification and that will be an extremely powerful catalyst to really deepen this realization which will automatically take care of everything.",104,2031,14,352,0

My suspicions were raised because the company I got the gummies from sell some chocolate and a 0.5 gram dose of the chocolate is very potent, similair to that of a 2 gram dried mushroom trip. And the gummies at a double that dose just provided a little brightness.

I'd love it if any of the vetrans round here could provide with some experienced insight to if they might think these gummies and choloate may have some other alternative cheaper pyschedelic?

Im taking this 3 days in a row with 2 days off. I may push it to 3 days on 1 day off while on quarantine to try to get used to it sooner.

Ive also accumulated host defense lions mane extract, theirs is believed to be from the mycelium but according to my research, (magic school bus doroty ann reference) this may not be as great as it can mostly be ground up substrate(brown rice or similiar). Im doing the caps that i produced now. I also believe the information i read stating mycelium is better may be biased, as the host defence is owned by stamets.. Im not sure...

I did take LSD a week before starting and had a small breakthrough that really gave me the push to put this forward after the reading ive been doing on quarantine.

over pretty much the past 2 days I have had amazing conversations with my friends, family, co-workers, and even strangers(which I will tell you right now I’ve always struggled with talking to people, for about all my life I’ve had anxiety to the first time I could faintly remember, I can vividly remember being afraid of talking to girls and not being able to talk to them in my elementary and middle school years even up to my high school career)

I have had interaction with homeless people, friends and family I honestly haven’t talked to in years genuinely, strangers that needed help and have made people laugh the most I have in nearly a couple years(I used to have to much anxiety I could joke around and make people laugh, I wasn’t fuckin funny at all, if anything I was a bit annoying)

I have had deep, and I mean deep conversations with friends I haven’t talked to in years, like the dude that got me into working out for the first time, 9th grade I was 240 pounds at 5’4 and had a shitty pre-pubescent lifestyle without friends, he took me in and pretty much gave me the start needed to have the voice I now have today.

Every single minute moment and every single apprehension of the future has existed now, and only now forever, it is a farce, it is fake. It has such an unreality to me know it’s almost funny I can see all the points in time In the past I was almost there(and I mean metaphorically millimeters from it😤😤😤)
All of my ego, my anxieties, my stresses and my depressive thoughts are just unrealistic to me now, I have a clear understanding(not conceptual) of what consciousness is and I can realize it’s conceptually a game to me at this point...

I see truly what is going on and I honestly don’t have a single ill will, illusion, or delusion that is sporadically bouncing around in my mind, or even tactile hallucinations which I used to have, I myself am so aware of the fact I have found insanity I have modified my given sober ego over the past 48 hours to be attractive, humorous, understanding, very open and full of healthy boundaries, the time to think and the time to remember, all the pleasures of delight without even trying, being okay with every single situation given to me, a hyper focused mindset, and a very friendly and loving “self”(not Capital S for a reason, you boys should know wassup😂)

First off, I spent the entire day yesterday spacey and forgetful. I started off the day in good spirits, just built a new computer and was excited to get it set up, so I felt accomplished upon waking up. 

By the end of the day I felt unmotivated, unfocused, spacy, blah, and forgetful of minor details.

Then this morning I wake up completely unmotivated and moody, and lethargic.

Which is at an absolute contrast to last week which I felt great.

So far, I've had the opposite of all the advertised results so I'm kind of wondering what the fuck is happening and what I did wrong.

I'm a bit irate that in all the research I did on Microdosing, that no one warned anyone that this was a possibility of microdosing. Most people said the worst case scenario about microdosing is the law, however here I am having trouble working at my job a day after.",44,969,5,176,0

2018-12-18 23:27:10,Day 4 MD update,"Short (hopefully) update:

Yesterday was day 4 of MD using the Fadiman schedule. I’ve detailed my experiences so far so you can read them, but to recap: first day was 5ug, second was 10ug, third was 7ug, and yesterday was 6ug.

The best day by far has been the 7ug. Felt amazing. 

6ug yesterday has been good from a productivity standpoint but doesn’t feel quite as “awesome”. It’s more buzzy, more adderall like. The biggest difference between the 6ug and the 7ug has been the second “after glow” day (which is today). The adderall type buzz has been just as strong IF NOT STRONGER the day after. Very bizarre. Again, it’s good from productivity/focus stand point. I have got a shit ton of work done. When I did the 7ug last week, the after glow day was almost non existent. Felt pretty normal. So, not sure why the lower dose is resulting in higher buzz after glow day.

On Thursday I’m going to try 4ug and see what that’s like. Depending on results I may go back to 7ug as that’s been the most enjoyable so far.

I want to say - after only a couple short weeks, MD is completely changing my life, and I wish I’d started years ago. I’m happier, way more focused and productive and my brain is working again - I’m having dozens of ideas an hour and I’m able to work on several things at the same time.

More in a few days.

Edit: I’ve noticed that I’m getting pretty frequent nightmares now. I never used to. I’d say I’m getting them once every few days as opposed to once every couple/three months. Don’t know if that will subside but given the massive benefits during the day, I have to push through it. 

Also, on the positive side, I’ve noticed I’m able to talk more confidently and eloquently to people. I can formulate ideas and sentences better and easier. ",15,1767,4,325,0

1. It is really discrete to have something like this in my fridge. 

2. The bottle appears to be darker and light protectant as is says on the bottle ""store away from heat and light."" 

3. The ingredients read certified organic cane alcohol (81-91%) and distilled water.

First MD was just 3ug.  It happened to be a really good day anyway, I was headed to vacation and I felt very ""in the moment"" and relaxed.  For the next 2 week I MD between 5-10ug every 4 days, but never got that feeling again.  I started to question the tabs I had (from a reputable source).  Two weeks ago I lowered my SSRI to 20mg, my xanax still 5mg, and the trazadone to 25mg.  I didn't feel like the MD was doing anything, but it wasn't hurting so I figured I'd continue.  I tried 20ug on Saturday, which was a crappy day (I thought), only effects I ever feel is that my feet feel heavy and time slows down.  BUT, on Saturday night I realized I had accomplished more than I thought.  Today, I wanted to check potency of tab, split one in 4 (about 25ug), and yep, it's too much.  I feel slightly dizzy, all my limbs are very heavy.  I think I'll go back to 20ug and see how it goes.  I realized that despite lowering all my other meds, I'm actually doing really well, so the MD may be working more than I think.

I just started crying at the peak (around 14PM - 15PM) because it brought up some emotions and i was already disappointed of the effects ( although i tried to keep being open minded) so i felt it was just a waste of time.. the effects was so light that i was able to fully concentrate on a tv show, i was very bored 😣. 

Some things i have to mention:

* The shrooms were dried well

*I grinded them very well and ate all with a nutella sandwich

* They were sitting in a drawer inside a plastic tic tac box inside a ziplock for like 3 weeks. 

What am i doing wrong here guys? Why its not like almost every trip report i red that people actually managed to ease their depression with that?

EDIT:

I grinded them, saved them in a plastic tictac box inside a ziplock and only after 3 weeks i ate them, it was all inside a drawer at room temp, could it be what made them weaker? That's what my dealer told me, is he full of shit or does he got a point?",53,1598,9,322,0

2022-12-19 04:05:17,A Cautionary Tale: Scammed while Microdosing for the First Time,"TLDR: I think that microdosing can impair your judgment and cause you to comply with suspicious instructions to do things that you would never normally agree to and will regret forever.  I am not saying that it will always end so tragically.  It was mostly a horrible, horrible coincidence, but just to be safe never answer the phone from a number that you don’t recognize while microdosing.

On Friday 12/16/22, in an act of desperation to tackle the mountain of tasks in front of me that need to be completed by year-end and cut through the fog of depression that so thoroughly impeded me, I decided to try (intentionally) microdosing LSD for the first and last time.  Other efforts to jumpstart my motivation had failed, so I ingested 20 ug of one of the most mind-altering substances in existence and hoped that my mind would change for the better.  I am holding out hope that maybe it still will, just in the most terrible way possible.  I have taken a large amount of LSD (several sheets) in my lifetime, and I have never had a particularly bad experience.  I have also taken untold quantities of shrooms, and I have unintentionally microdosed multiple times from inhaling dried shroom particles while cleaning vermiculite off of very large quantities or making capsules. I usually take 400 ug of LSD, so 20 ug seemed like a reasonable starting point.  Fuck was I wrong.  That 20 ug rocked me far, far harder than any 500 ug dose ever has; and it was completely devoid of anything fun or redeeming.

At 1:35 PM, I received a call from a private number and answered it, instead of ignoring it like I usually would.  The caller claimed to be an agent with U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and proceeded to rattle off a list of horrifying charges, including shipping drugs and money laundering in El Paso, where I had just visited last week for work.  I had done none of these things, but the caller convinced me that my identity had been stolen and used to set up bank accounts tied to serious criminal activity.  The group of scammers then spoofed the phone number for the US Marshals Office for the Southern District of Texas, spoofed the phone number for the local police department and eventually terrified me into believing that this was really happening.  I was kept on the phone the entire time, which I later realized was a tactic to distract me from evaluating the claims more critically.  The scammers had all of my personal information: Date of birth, social security number, and travel history.  It was really convincing and scary.

After a couple hours, I was convinced by the scammers to withdraw funds for my bank account.  After withdrawing the funds, I hung up the phone and attempted to recall the number to verify that the number was not being spoofed.  I got through to the US Marshal’s Office, but then received a call from the same number … AND I FUCKING ANSWERED IT.  WTF, how can anyone be so fucking stupid?  Then, I insisted on keeping the cash in my possession and asked the caller to prove that this was not an elaborate scam, but the scammer intimidated me by saying that I was reneging on the Alternative Dispute Resolution agreement … AND I DID NOT ASK FOR A COPY OF THE AGREEMENT.  WTF 2?  Then I received a QR Code … AND DROVE TO A BITCOIN ATM.  WTF 3?  So, I am in the convenience store shaking with fear while depositing the funds one $100 bill at a time into the ATM to the wallet represented by the QR code.

I then drove to the liquor store to buy beer to try to cope with the terrible realization of what had just happened.  Then, I called the phone number for the US Marshal’s Office again and learned what I already strongly suspected: That it was all a scam.  The receptionist said that this same scam has happened hundreds of times and listed several really bad examples, including people that had advanced degrees that fell for this scam.  Not that I felt any better about it.

I can’t say with 100% certainty that microdosing caused my judgment to be impaired and caused me to give in to the demands of scammers, but it really, really seems like it did.  By the way, I graduated with high honors from one of the most difficult engineering schools in the country.  Maybe the MK Ultra mind control experiment was onto something?  I complied with instructions to go to the bank, withdraw funds, and deposit them into a Bitcoin ATM.  I would normally refuse to follow instructions that seem suspicious.  In fact, I usually refuse to comply with any instructions that someone emphatically provides just to be contrarian.  I let my imagination run wild and put reason on the back burner.  I am absolutely devastated: More so about how I lost the money than the $16k that I lost.

I then spent the following Saturday reliving the events and turning them over in my mind, spending over six hours in bed paralyzed by an existential crisis.  How could I possibly live with myself after analyzing the egregious errors of judgment that enabled the scammers to confiscate not just my money, but also my dignity, self-confidence, self-worth, and self-image? I think that microdosing may have played a part in this horrific situation by impairing my judgment.  Regardless, I can never forgive myself.  Likewise, I can never forget it nor fix it.  The only way to cope with the disaster without self-harm is to treat my financial rape as a figurative death:  The person that I was on December 16th is dead and from the wreckage was born the person that I will now be.  The fate of my current and future self still linger in superposition.  Will I be consumed with bitterness and self-doubt, or will I find a way to harness the indescribable rage for something positive?  One thing is certain, I will never be microdosing again.  I was in a deep hole before this Friday, but I am orders of magnitude lower now than I have ever been.  I wouldn't wish this on anyone and I would pay at least $20k to go back in time to fix it.",63,5954,10,1062,0

2022-08-21 13:16:56,Microdosing MDMA to get over trauma of bad mushroom trip?,"Greetings fellow microdosers.

&#x200B;

**What is your experience with microdosing MDMA, specifically to treat anxiety?**

&#x200B;

Background:

I've been microdosing (mushrooms) for a year with very good results. However, after some stressful time at work I decided to attempt a full trip and it didn't go well, to say the least. I've suffered a panic attack - though the symptoms were mostly physical.

After the trip I felt ok for the rest of the day and next day, but a low mood began the days after. The main impact is that after a few days still I've developed insomnia which is characterized with being woken up with a jolt immediately after I fall asleep. I've had a few terrible weeks of sleepless nights. Now I'm able to get several decent hours of sleep during the night, but very disturbed, waking up extremely early (4am) and unable to get back to sleep or nap, which is torturous when I'm so sleepy especially during the day. I'm unable to function because most days I'm debilitatingly tired with no way or relief until nighttime.

&#x200B;

I've tried to treat this with prescribed medication but nothing really helps. I'm not sure whether going back to microdosing mushrooms is a good idea, but I am intrigued by microdosing MDMA. I'm very hesitant to try a full dose at my condition, but wondering whether a course of microdosing MDMA - coupled with self care, journaling, meditation, etc. can be a good idea.

I need to say that im not new to the experience of no self it was magic to say the least.
I've communicated with a person I've never met almost telepathically and puzzled the metaphysical higher experience of self in to my integrating of transhuman  energetic selflessness where I've never been more awake.  It was a if I've been sitting in the shadow of experience in its most radical hard-core self.

Like a flower did the most unfathomable rush of pure love reveal itself in the dicection of dicection and self devilry. When I speak of the devil I'm referring to every thing we do witch is not in tune with our authentic self. 

I cried watching the room as if I was born a new and saw it for the first time. 
I could have won a million Nobel peace prices.  They would never compare to the confidence that truth brought me. And it became apparent that the reason why is because of fear of love.

 I started to cry, feeling Meta-trancendant  peace,  knowing that none of my family or friends to even experience, it was as if I was shot out a cannon  and experienced life above a coldly sundown in empty gravity fir a second where pure love  showered me with nothing like any movie can portray love to be.  


The To the extent Wehere  capability, capacity of primitive articulation to even justify the moment, one sentence came out and made sense ""oh my GOD!"" ""Allah"" 


 But i have forgetting the wisdom in practice and become a zen devil. In the relative dualistic nature of such experiences without proper discipline or integrating.



Today I live as a calendar angel.. (not literary"" but energetically wise like al of us more or less.  I seek refuge in porn, weed, and watching movies especially marvel movies.

I love cinemotigrahpy to my core. The movies of marvel are like standing by a lake, and only seeing and feeling the reflection of that potential of truth in my past experience.

I have trued to jump and I ocationaly drown in the reflection wishing it was present 🎁. 


Which I know it paradoxically or ironically  dose  by experience.

I've over stimulated  The jang and I'm out of control I've had lost thoughts and lost to impulses and kneeling in the face of life,  growth and fear. I'm waiting a son coming and I've been submitted to depressin, suicide thoughts and lack of commitment, courage to change.  Ive been paralysed in to the comfort of deception, anger and envy.  

I've had marvelous  mystical experiences I've cried for the world to see within themselves. 

But that is just a faded candles of memory   locked back in empty space.  I always thought the mystical experiences say and the coming future of drinking ayahuasca to set me free. But It haunts me more then anything.

What am I to do with all this hording of wisdom and information on an empty island guarded by nihilistic shark's. 

I was once a person who become good at everything I say my mind to, a creative soul,  ready to show the world.  I tried everything but this things are but gifts wrapped as ghost's from the past. 

People knew me I was some body.   But psychedelics made me see. To never fall to sleep once more. Everything that's is left is my shattered self tempted to drink from the cup of material lustfull poison. To get back. 

I'm addicted to the witches candy. 🍬 

And blinded by the light. 

Where will the dance with Dantes inferno stop. 


All in asking is what do I do. 

I met my deamon. In a place of no time and space, locked up in infinity with a nightmarish dimension of pure fare afraid of letting go. 

The 🎶 in the room became deamon like. In the room did my friends find morph in to something like a devilish trickster, taunting my emotion in every move I took. 

With no energy or places to hide from mysel, was I energetic wrapped and drained by fare. 

My knees collapsed with my face on the floor.

I grasped for ear and couldn't move. 

""What do I do now

What is that I.

Can't cant do this anymore. 

J can't breathe 

I'm going to die

Letting go and die became the only mercy.


This was my first encounter with shrooms.
These words can't even justify the experience.  Thus is not always like this thi shrooks can be so beautiful  when you learn to integrate the wisdom after such trips.  And therefore recognize the intelligence of the symbiotic nature with it as u in nature. You can also just have more upbeat experiences. Recognise that I say  upbeat and not  positive. As u know many people of dualistic perception to therfore make a bad trip a negative thing as in a bad thing.  Yes it's scary  but necessary. 

My question is do any if you know who, what to do or contact or to do  to get me out of this cage. Please. Tank you.

If you've tried psychedelics by microfilming, read a book or something  let me know. 

I've heard Joe rogan speak about floating.  And I want to try it.

I guess all u want to do is trust myself again  and give back. 

A funny thing with some psychedelics experience like for example molly makes you just want to share the love experience with others. If you want me to write down how my experience with it was let me know.",40,5467,7,995,0

2018-12-16 02:35:35,My firsy experience micro dosing,"Started getting into LSD late in the summer this year instead of smoking and drinking as much. Really good overall experience I wasn't stupid about it reading into it and watching videos before i did anything. Me and my older brother ship it in from dream market and trip on weekends with the boys but had to do it at night because Im still in grade schopl

After a bit started wondering about tripping during the daytime. One day on the weekend I took like 60-70 ug in the morning then went out skateboarding all day overall really sick. around the next week one morning before school took the same amount. Kicked in half way through first period and I think I started to act out of the normal but mood was lifted hecka during lunch went out with my friends and they could notice I was acting different but I've known them for a long time so it makes sense.

Had a test after lunch and I was not really peaking anymore but I could still not concentrate and I just cheated off the homie beside me. The rest of the day was about the same just lack of concentration but I drew on all my pages to help with that. Went home I was pretty much sober and I had supper with my family I was fine. 

That was pretty much all the shit that happend the first time I microdosed I've been doing it alot over the last month's just to keep my life more interesting during the week but I would recommend not doing this on a day where you have something like a test or shit.

2018-04-24 13:59:25,What Did I Do Wrong?,"Okay.  I'm not looking for a high, I'm trying to treat my depression.  Everything I've read about microdosing LSD makes it sound like what I need.  
So I got some micropellets of 1P-LSD, and put them in 50ml of vodka.  Left them for a week to get good and dissolved.  At 150ug per micropellet, this should have produced a solution of 12ug/ml.  
But it's not working.  I started with 12ug and felt okay, but nothing that couldn't be put down to just finally getting a day that wasn't overcast and cold.  I skipped, then yesterday did it again.  Again nothing.  A few hours later I did another 15ug.  That's a total of 27ug in a single day.  I should have felt something, but no relief from the depression.  I'm still living in a world where everyone is an idiot and there's no hope of anything.
This is a sharp contrast to what I've read and so I'm wondering if there wasn't something wrong with my solution.  Do micropellets not dissolve in vodka?  Is there something in there that destroys the active chemical?

---
 
So I feel guilty and bad even asking something like this but…

Ok so I have major depression and have been on meds (Wellbutrin) for 20 years. The meds have always kept me right on the edge of sanity. The last couple of years they have not been able to keep up with what is going on in our world today!!

I have been on the fence with microdosing for about 5 years. Recently I bought some 1p-lsd and gave it a try. I have been microdosing for a solid 6 weeks now and switching from 1 on 2 days off to once a week. The results have been amazing!! I mean no crap, night and day freaking AMAZING!!

I would think it was in my head but everything has turned around!! My clients have been asking me what is going on, never seen you so focused even before this pandemic. 

I also want to say that I have gout in most of my joints, it has even helped with pain.

Now my long term partner is totally against drugs. They grew up in a country where they kill drug dealers and in a very conservative home.

Smoking weed was a deal breaker, and they said it was because it was illegal. Now I always told them if they ever make it legal I am smoking again!! Now it is legal and…

So my partner can be really grumpy and gets bad migraines. I know they would benefit from a couple of micrograms but talking to them and showing them data would send them over the edge. I do think if I told them it probably would end the 12 year relationship, so discussing it with them is out of the question, even though they are a legit scientist all rational thinking goes out the window and LSD is considered a hard drug????

So would it be awful to give them just 3ug? I don’t think I ever could even if the whole world said it’s ok but damn just to think how it could help and they could benefit makes me want to ignore what I think is right!!

I mean does ANYONE remember that jingle …”I wish I could teach the world to sing in perfect harmony”… it makes me think, hey I might be able to pull that off!!

Anyways just thinking out loud, and ready for what comes out of this conversation starter, as the wise man once said…

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
 They’d probably put my head in a guillotine
 But it’s alright, Ma, it’s life, and life only

2021-03-22 15:40:42,Alternating macrodosing with microdosing,"The day before yesterday I took a 175 µg macrodose of 1cp-LSD. It was my first experience - a bit underwhelming, I was expecting more after all the hype around LSD. The colour intensity when looking at Monet or Van Gogh or my own artwork were enjoyable and the experience provoked fruitful thoughts. The space depth and time speed perception was greatly reduced. Sadly I did not see more patterns than usual. Yesterday I felt calm and well and enjoyed a deep peace inside me, a very rare sensation to me.

Today I continued with my 10 µg microdosing schedule. I took 14 µg to offset any tolerance due to the macrodose. I can confirm that the microdose today worked and had its desired energizing effects. So you can combine macro and micro with little detrimental effects to the microdose.",40,789,4,140,0
2020-11-29 21:19:16,Here I go down my first rabbit hole!,"Just started micro dosing with Psilocybin about 10 days ago. Not knowing what to expect I took a 3.5 gram dose and broke it into 9 equal parts, or approximately 0.39 grams per dose. My first dose was half, or about 0.2 grams. After about 2 hours I felt basically nothing. I was disappointed that it did essentially nothing so I took a 10 mg edible. What followed after that is only what I can explain as the deepest philosophical experience I ever imagined. I suddenly understood the nature of the universe and my state of mind and level of consciousness within it.

Suffice it to say, the physical universe around us does not exist unless we create it with our minds. If you take the concept of our world out of your mind nothing exists. The same can be said for people. If a person does not exist in your mind they dont exist anywhere. The very thought that you have for a person gives them life. Think of this with a random item like a golf ball. Prior to read the words ""golf ball"" where did that object exist -- nowhere. The most thoughtful thing you can do for a person is to think about them because doing so gives them life. That is what God does for us. We exist in His thoughts and nowhere else. That is how we are created in the ""image"" of God, imagination of God. Nothing is this world is actually real. When we die a physical death we dont die. The world around us, including our body, just disappears because it no longer exists in our minds.

The next time I tried this I took 2 doses, or about 0.80 grams. Boy did this work. This was more than a micro dose! After 90 minutes I began feeling a sense of warmth and love I had never experienced before and it continued to grow with time and peaked at about 150 - 180 minutes. The sense of love was not sexual in nature but it certainly included that because it became so obvious to me that the gate to God, in this lifetime, occurs through a woman for a man, or a man for a woman, but I can certainly see the man/man, woman/woman avenue as well. My disposition is heterosexual but the same sex will work as well as long as it is supported by love. Love transcends the physical world so this is truly a moot point, but a necessary one in this lifetime for most people. It is the way our souls connect in a physical world but this can also be achieved through meditation, or other forms of physical contact.

There is a lot more for sure but I will end it here.

The question I have is, was this the experience I should have had on an 0.80 gram dose and what happens next if I can increase it? It certainly felt overwhelming and I dont know if I'm ready for something like a 1.5 gram dose or more. Overwhelming might not be the right word. Consumed is probably better but consumed in a good way. I just dont know if I'm ready for more just yet.

The other things are what I expected like the waves and vibrant colors. Purple seemed to be the predominant color in everything. What! an experience.",36,2956,8,566,0

Just out of curiosity, in your opinion what would be more helpful in an interview-type setting? The reason I ask this is because MDMA is known to help with the social side (great for interacting with the interviewer) but LSD is more known to help with the creative side (great for the questions the interviewer might ask).

So, anyone care to chip in their bit of knowledge?

The brain makes a choice on what to do. It can literally feel phantom pain or ignore real nerve damage.

Is ""placebo"" a meaningless phrase to discredit anything you don't like the idea of?

I know placebo relates to a sham substance, but you can eat a substance as ""food"" but it had no value and your brain will think you've eaten.

I just think placebo isn't an invalid thing. Therapy could be called a placebo since it doesn't do anything yet it works and can affect the brain, physical symptoms, appetite etc.",97,623,17,111,0

Future functionality would offer things such as a journal to keep track of effects, a calendar overview to show what days you dosed, how your dosage has changed, premade schedules and stacks, etc.

2018-12-29 16:18:23,"If you're taking over 20ug more than every 3 days, you're not microdosing.","I'm seeing a lot of people on here taking 30, 50, even 60ug and more and doing so every day or every other day. You're not micro dosing. You're taking small amounts of psychedelics and having mini trips. This does nothing to benefit you and only burns you out quickly. The point of micro dosing is to not feel the effects whatsoever. If you feel any different, you're doing it wrong. When I started microdosing, I started with 6ug every three days and after a couple weeks ramped to 10ug and then 15ug. After 2 months, I stopped completely to reset. I'll start back up in a month or so. I didn't notice any effects for the first week, until I started to realize that my overall mood had improved on off and on days and that I was feeling more confident and more focused. I shoot pool in a league and I noticed that I was winning all my games. But never once did I feel like I was on something. I never felt funny. I only ever felt like myself. It's important to not abuse these drugs and to not blow your brain out because you want to feel something. If low amounts don't work for you, then I'd just stop completely. If you've used more than 60ug in 9 days, then it's time to call it quits for a while.

2022-08-06 22:59:53,Feeling discouraged about MD because common sense tells me it’s inherently dangerous to long term heart health,"I was so happy to discover microdosing and all the wonderful benefits I thought it would provide. Now, after more research, I’m uncomfortable with the knowledge that psilocin has an extremely high affinity for 5-HT2B receptors, and consistently activating those receptors has been proven to cause valvulopathy with multiple other drugs that act on these same receptors.

Yes, I know that there have been no long term studies that prove the connection between psylocibin and valvulopathy, but that’s only because we don’t have enough data yet. We are the long term studies. I have read all the rationalizing that people use to try and get around this, from pointing out the low half life of psylocibin relative to these other drugs, and the supposed “safe” maximum dosage of 3mg (0.3g dried) daily and the tolerance breaks that are supposed to help reset the system. However, valvulopathy isn’t spontaneous, it’s a long term disease. Common sense would tell me the more you activate those receptors over a longer period of time, the higher chance you have of causing irreversible valve damage.

It’s difficult for me to take a capsule and feel good about it now, when that capsule’s sole purpose is supposed to make me feel good. I worry more about this now more than I do about things like alcohol and sugar. Just incredibly bummed out, and confused how other people can feel confident about MD with this knowledge. Or maybe most people just aren’t aware of this yet? Would love to hear some perspective from those who knowingly MD with 5-HT2B in the back of their minds.

P.S. I don’t mean for this sound as though I am questioning the judgement of those who microdose. I would love nothing more than to MD, just as long as I know it is not harming me in the long term.

In the above thread from 7 years ago, the OP attempts to find a drug closer to psilocin in terms of its dosage and resulting plasma concentration relative to its EC 50 for the 5-HT2b receptor, and also one that's only a partial agonist. Bromocriptine is a 5-HT2b partial agonist 55% with moderate affinity (pKi 7.25 = kI 56 nm (also here) and an overall potency of 204 (EC 50). Bromocriptine appears to be able to induce cardiac valvulopathies at concentrations far below the EC 50 (around 50x lower).([https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mds.22228](https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mds.22228)) This would suggest that a 5-HT2b agonist of similar efficacy would also be able to induce valvulopathies at similarly low concentrations. Psilocin's EC-50 of 58 nM means that it could be cardiotoxic at chronic concentrations 1nM. Psilocin shows a peak serum concentration of 8.2 ng/ml, or 40 nM after administration of 15.7 mg (/70kg) psilocybin. Assuming linear dose vs plasma concentration, 0.5 mg of psilocybin would reach the equivalent plasma concentration of bromocriptine in the high dosage study, **that's equivalent to 100mg dried P. cubensis** assuming 0.5% concentration.

I want to share to my experience in the hopes of maybe getting some advice on my situation.

Recently, I have been researching into microdosing and thought I bought some pills from a trusted vendor. Everything from there has just been a downward spiral. This person sent me an anonymous package through Xpress Delivery. At first they asked for a $150 in bitcoin for discreet delivery fees. Once that got sorted, I thought finally I ll get to start my journey to better health. 

But this morning I got an email from the same Xpress Delivery that the package has been confiscated by DEA and deemed as illegal. Only if medical papers are provided will they release the package. Now, the seller classified as this was for medical purposes. And if I can’t provide the documents to support that both the seller and I both have to pay $350, so a total of $700 bucks to clear the fines and get the package.

Now at this point, with my anxiety attack flaring, I don’t want those pills but I am worried that they have my address. 

I could really use some advice. Please help!

I have ahdh, ocd autism and I have savant art visions.

I microdosed mushrooms just once over a month ago and everything is worse since.

Before I could feel everything.

I tried MDing because the immense and near constant stress of feeling everything all at once made me disassociate. 
Like a constant panic attack, but at the same time amazingly euphoric, the problem is dealing with the stress.

Now I feel nothing. 

It basically reduced the upsides of ADHD ect and increased the downsides.

I've gone from (completely sober) pupil dilating euphoria to ""meh"" over the things I love.

My mind is quieter but it's actually harder to concentrate because there's nothing that I'm passionate about to concentrate on.

In fact the quietness just makes the ruminations and distractions worse, as there's nothing else there.

I feel serene but miserable.

TL;DR

Basically what I've learnt is that mushrooms just made me less stressed not by helping me learn to deal with stress but by making everything matter less to begin with.

This is an awful trade, I'd personally rather have the panic attack from the stress.

It might make every better or everything worse.

Then I went out to my car to go work. Nature seemed clearer, brighter, and more beautiful than usual. I felt happy and appreciative. Walking felt a bit floaty like the a come up of a full dose. I got in the car but I just sat there listening to the birds and wind while i stared at the sky. I felt complete peace. Then I started laughing at the thought of walking into restaurants and delivering food while feeling like this. So I canceled my shift and went back inside. I work for doordash so I schedule when I want. The buzz was too nice for me to spend the day driving around. I felt completely carefree. 

It was so nice that I decided to eat some more (haha). I ate another gram and a half and smoked a bunch of bud.

The problem is that I becomes obsessed with MD since my ordinary level of thinking and creating is just depressing in comparison. 

Some special things regarding me that might play a role: I have a braindamage that made me low energy autist (no autism diagnose tho) more or less and I also take lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) which give me some of the energy and focus.

And still, so. much. anxiety. I feel like I am losing my mind and I can not get myself to a place of ease. 

I remember in college really enjoying microdosing mushrooms. Of course, at this time I did not really have anxiety and more so found it a fun endeavor. 

My OB / Dr. Keeps recommending Zoloft. Listen, I am not totally against psychiatric medicine but I truly have never had a good experience with things of the sort and don’t really want to try now.

So - is there any research or experience of microdosing mushrooms while breastfeeding? My LO is not exclusively breastfed. She is primarily on formula but we breastfeed to connect and I don’t really want to give it up yet. Thoughts? Experiences?

So, perhaps this is the wrong take, but the more I research some of the educational opportunities to learn about the practice, science, and application of microdosing, the more I realize how cost prohibitive it is for so many folks. For example:

$199 for a one day virtual Esalen class with Dr. Fadiman and Adam Bramlage

$197 for Third Wave's microdosing course

$117 (97 pounds) for a 2.5 hour course from the Microdosing Institute

2020-03-10 13:37:04,My modified Paul Stamets MD protocol,"I've been experimenting with MDing psilocybin for about 7 months, mainly doing Paul's 4 on 3 off protocol with niacin.

First off: My intentions are strictly for mental acuity and being able to function at a high level as long as possible. I run a digital marketing agency and work on the computer for about 14-16 hours per day. MDing has allowed has pretty much allowed me to be as productive in the second half of my day as the beginning of the day is. I MD around hour 4-6 of my workday.

This is my protocol. After much experimenting I have noticed the hardest part is having complete consistently across all 4 days on due to tolerance build. From my experience, I build up a tolerance if I do .1g all 4 days. Day 1 & 2 on .1g each day are great and the same, but day 3 wanes off a bit and day 4 is noticeably the least effective.

So I decided to modify it and see if I can keep a consistent effect across all days by doing the following:

Day 1: .07g

Day 2: .09g

Day 3: .12-.13g

Day 4: .15-.16g

After a lot of testing, this method of progressively increasing dosage each day seems to give me the most consistency throughout the 4 days. If anyone else has tried this method I'd love to hear your experience.

The dosage will completely depend on the batch of psilocybin you have. I always start smaller than I think I need and build up from there respectively.

EDIT: The original post I had my decimals/zeros all messed up. Sorry for all the confusion. At the original stated doses, that for sure wouldn't be healthy.",36,1527,6,287,0

- Cut the 150mcg tab in four. 🔪 

- Setting:- Girlfriend’s place. Put phone on ‘Do Not Disturb. No body knows. 🤫 

- Weather’s cloudy- rainy at times. Wind noises and chirping birds are audible. 🏡🌧🌳🦜

- Dropped Tab 37.5mcg @ 10:30am 👨🏽‍🔬 😌

-  11:05am- Gf prepared some warm soy milk 🥛 with honey and sesame, a massive bowl. Yummy. Nearly full. 🤰🏼 

- 11:30am- 🛌 under blanket, she’s nearby reading. I’m just looking around in room- walls, ceiling, bed frame to notice anything special. Nothing yet. 🤷🏻‍♂️

- 11:45am- Watching a podcast on Youtube. The squeaking from the guest’s chair is noticeable. 🤔

- 12:00pm- Taking a dump. 💩 Enjoying it a bit too much today. 😅 Otherwise, nothing special.

- 12:15pm- Listening to music. Never appreciated Macbook’s speakers this much. Or is it just music... 🤔😊

- 1:15pm- Last hour:- made love with gf, just kept going and had the best orgasm ever. Can’t stop the giggles 🤭. Kept trying to verbally express the reasons for my unstoppable giggles to her in an effort to conceal my state. Chill music in the background throughout. Why is she hungry and wants us to get food when I just want to sit and continue listening to music? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤔

- 1:50pm- Outside the 🏡 finally. Too bright, should have brought sunnies. Drove alright to the restaurant. 🚗 The plants, the trees, the FM radio in the car. We live in a heaven. 🥰 Also, just realised how much I’m loving just the act of writing my thoughts down and the fluency that I feel in expressing myself. Couldn’t stop but flash a smile to the restaurant staff to share all the good vibes. Restaurant’s playing nursery rhymes on a tv in the corner for kids. Love the alphabets (A,B,C,D) song. ☺️

- 3:15pm- Now I feel having a heavy lunch (lamb and bread) wasn’t a good idea as my tummy feels weird. Have come to a leafy green reserve/park now. Don’t feel like leaving the car. The chirping birds are such a blessing. Asked gf to drive this time. Stopped on our way to get some blueberries, skittles and chocolate from the supermarket.  🍎 🍫 🍬 Want to just slow down a bit.. 💭 

- 3:30pm- Still inside car. Pretty introspective right now. Partner’s chatty but I, not so much, just want to listen to the sounds of nature silently. 

- 4pm- Still in the car park of the reserve. Appreciating stillness. Don’t even want to swallow the saliva so I don’t disturb the stillness. Just keenly observing everything. Not doing anything. Peace is in not doing. Just being. 🧘‍♂️ 

- 6:30pm- Back at friend’s place after having stayed in the reserve for a fair bit followed by a short stroll around the pond within the reserve. On our way back stopped to get some grapes and scented candles. 🍇 🕯 Feeling slow, but good. Movie time. 🎥 

- 7:45am (Next Day)- Woke up from the deepest of sleeps I’ve ever had. The candles must have helped. Didn’t complete the movie last night and left half way as it was tense and about war. 

- Thoughts: Looking back at it, I’ve made the decision of befriending Lucy and incorporating micro-dosing in life. It’s the help I can benefit from. I’m glad about everything yesterday. The baby-dose that wasn’t micro really and allowed me intro to what this is all about. No visuals whatsoever. Two important things, (1) Throughout I kept getting this message-thought, “what’s the hurry, slow down a bit”. (2) It is so much more comfortable being my own self. It certainly helped confidence and shunned away anxious feelings. Energy wise, let’s just say I would not have wanted to go to the gym- maybe that’s because the dose wasn’t a microdose.

I'm 25 years old 80kg and 5ft 11. So I've read that when you first get started it's generally a good idea to experiment to find the best dose for you and I kind of want to experiment with the ranges so I can get a feel of what doses would benefit me the most.

So on day 1, I started out with around **0.15g**, didn't feel it but kept going anyway.

On day 2, I micro-dosed **0.25g** before going to work, I'm not sure if this effected me or not in the sense of whether what I was experiencing was a placebo. After a lot of the workday had passed, I had reflected upon the day and noticed that there was a lot less hesitation in my actions, there was rarely any moment of second guessing my decisions and on this particular day I had only slept for 3 and a half hours - but my energy at work felt higher than usual.

On day 3, I don't have a lot to do today and want to experiment with finding that ""upper range"" where people say colors seem brighter and they focus more so I took **0.35g** \- I remember reading somewhere that the ""threshold"" is 0.25g so I was expecting this one to actually hit me a little. But again, I don't believe it has.

Is this normal? My main concern is that what I've purchased isn't actually powdered psilocybe cubensis. The guy had mostly high reviews before I bought them, but I just checked the page now whilst writing this and he's received a 1 star review in regards to the shrooms.

2017-07-21 12:40:31,Hwav a question on what is worse: smoking weed or microdosing?,"Hi! So yesterday I posted something to the LSD sub asking basically if, at 17 and a few months until 18, would it would be a good idea to microdose.

Of course, for me, I think it's a better idea than ""abusing"" weed. But would any of you know otherwise? 

I have been ""addicted"" to weed, a long time ago, as result of being with someone who smoked A LOT (stupid young love), breaking up and thinking I ""need it."" But that was a long time ago and ever since then I have attempted to use weed on a more therapeutic level. 

It doesn't really work out because I just end up smoking more than I need (I like getting high and writing).

Obviously, this is taking a toll on my brain. 

Microdosing, I've researched it and all that jazz, seems to be a much more positive use of lsd, and because the doses are lower and periodical, do you think I might be able to use it without doing harm to my brain? 

What I am looking to get out of microdosing is essentially breaking my weed use altogether, and then of course discovering if it works for me and if I should use it at all.

I would like to better myself using LSD rather than taking it as a drug and tripping. 
Perhaps just sit down and meditate or write or walk. 

Any advice given is muuuch appreciated! 
And to those who feel the need to call me young and foolish pls don't because young is just a number and I ain't foolish and I know it. Thanks!

I guess I’m hoping someone has a more reassuring take on this. I started microdosing last year for mental health issues after several different prescribed drugs failed to offer any relief. It was the only thing that stuck. Over the course of a few months, my mental health improved incredibly, and I finally got my life back. I still microdose occasionally but not as frequently. This new information feels like it changes things. I regret reading all this because if it was all just a placebo effect, then it’s not going to work if I need major help again, and NOTHING else works for me.

&#x200B;

 I (24yr old female who weighs about 130 pounds) took shrooms last night for the first time ever. I have been diagnosed with ADD, depression, anxiety, and OCD. I stopped taking my medication 3 days before taking shrooms because I'm a paranoid person and didn't want to mix anything and cause a bad time. Normally I take 30-40mg of Adderall RX and 150mg of Wellbutrin RX daily. Last night I started off by taking 2 whole mushrooms and after not feeling anything for an hour and a half I continued taking more. I was at an outdoor concert and didn't drink alcohol. I stayed well hydrated and drank a smoothie with the mushrooms to make sure I had something in my stomach. By the end of the night, I took 5 whole shrooms and a cap and never felt anything. I did this with a group of people and they all felt something after taking only two is there a reason this happened? I heard that SSRIs can cancel out the effects of mushrooms but Wellbutrin is a NDRI and like I said before I stopped taking it 3 days ago to clear it from my system. I was thinking that since my body struggles with dopamine/serotonin regulation I might have a higher tolerance for things like mushrooms?",32,1289,6,244,0

Idk if that's related to microdosing or not, but sometimes when i'm really stressed out, if i focus or meditate i can have some slight visual distorsion (which i used to have more intensely when i macrodosed a few years ago, lasted several months). 
I sometimes get scared and anxious for this, though i'm very skilled in acceptance and in ""feeding your demons"" like a book i read said.
I'm also a very sensitive person (which is why i kept my dose so low) and i'm sometimes very susceptible even to subtle changes, plus now it isn't the best moment as a lot of sad things happened/are happening to me..

That said microdosing (paired with therapy) has helped me **tremendously** with depression and with tasting life again! It feels like waking up from a long sleep that lasted years!

Idk i feel a bit confused and wanted to report this symptoms to see if anyone can relate or help me. Sadly psychedelics are illegal where i'm living so talking with a psychiatrist/psychologist is quite useless..

Shrooms -> LSD -> Cannabis -> Modafinil/Adderall -> Repeat,"I microdose shrooms for about a year now And now I received an LSD to try to microdose. It came to my mind that I can microdose different substances and I thought that it would help not build tolerance since it's different anyway(?) or at least it helps. So I will microdose a different substance every time and when it comes to repeat the cycle, I have given 3 days since that previous same substance.

Kindly look at this scheduling:

Monday -> Shrooms (0.1g blue meanies)

Tuesday -> LSD (10ug)

Wednesday -> Cannabis (not yet sure, but similar range of lowness in comparison to others)

Thursday -> Modafinil (50mg) or Adderall (I prefer moda)

Friday -> Shroom (3 days break from the last one, no tolerance?)

Saturday -> LSD  (3 days break from the last one, no tolerance?)

The other variance of this I'm thinking is: I can also try finding a 5th new different substance for Friday and then give my weekends as a break, no taking of anything, maybe just coffee. Then repeat on Monday using Shroom, Tuesday LSD, etc, until the weekend as the break(no microdose).

[https://chacruna.net/why-chronic-microdosing-might-break-your-heart/](https://chacruna.net/why-chronic-microdosing-might-break-your-heart/)

Background for myself regarding microdose only:  0.1 or 0.2 psilocybin ground fine powder scooped or in pill format: James Fadiman protocol (1 day on every 3-4 days, sometimes I'll do 2-4 days on per week) for over a year and a half now. Have not taken longer than 7 days off. Coffee and cannabis is about every day but significantly less than before micro dosing. Under 300mg caffeine per day and under half a gram of cannabis smoked or less than 15mg edible per day.

Pros: If comparing to before MD almost all aspects of my life marginally but noticeably better than before. Just overall solid quality of life gains.

Cons: not sure, been on for too long. Sometimes my heart does feel racey/strained but could be in conjunction of coffee? Usually makes for really good cardio work

Any mega brain heads that are also heavy in cardiology and human biology etc exercise health etc. got the science to drop on me here?

I would assume this heart issue can possibly be counteracted by a lot of exercise or perhaps bloodflow optimizations??? I have consistently been exercising on  4-7 days a week without faltering since the beginning of the psilocybin microdose routine. With a light caffeine/MD/cannabis stack can go moderate-hard for 2-3 hours of exercise per day mix of lifting/calisthenics/hard sprints/long walking etc.

2021-08-14 14:05:12,Anything I should know prior to a break?,"I started shrooms exactly 3 weeks ago today. It hasn’t been very structured. Usually 200mg-300mg every 3 days. But during the weekends on Saturday I’ve been doing .5-.7 and trying to meditate while I have off from work

Overall it’s really kicked my depression in the ass. But this last week I almost feel as if it’s havi the opposite effects.  So after today I am going to just take a week or 2 off and reassess my mental health and see where I am. Then either start a structured protocol, or wait until I can just macrodose every few months.

2021-07-20 20:25:29,Not feeling anything sensation at all from Golden Teacher's shrooms...,"So i online ordered a 70 G bag of Golden Teacher's dried  shrooms. I've never done any magic mushrooms before and i wanted to micro dose. I know i should buy a digital scale, but money tight at the momment.

So, i'm doing my little micro dosing by just pinching off a tiny ''index finger nail '' size of shroom ( at first it was even smaller then that.) I've done that now about 5 times mid afternoon till about 10pm the past 2 days or so. Felt no change, no high, no serenity, saw no unicorns, basically no change up at all. 

Oh one night i may have felt a slight buzz high , but very very mild. 

For comparison , i have either smoked a tiny bit of weed or ingested THC chocolate, thc gummies, thc cbd oil and i always got a decent buzz or small high that lasted 4-5 hours. Does not take much of that for me. 

I will assume i am taking far too small an amount of the Golden Teacher shroom to do anything.  

At the same time, i do not want to ingest a large piece and go tripping. I may macro dose one day when i feel the time is right and i want to experience either Ego Death or a purge of emotions. But for now i just want to stick with the micro dose experimentation.

Should i just buy a digital scale so i know precisely how much? i read .125 to .150g is a good micro dose starting off point. 

Do i need to grind my shrooms to powder, put into capsules, weigh it to the desired amount and ingest? 

or should i just slowly increase the piece i tear off , nibble and let the shroom juices go sublingual before swallowing ?

   I’m pretty new to micro dosing but am pretty familiar with hallucinogens. I been pretty curious and would like to explore micro dosing. I have some questions and also curious about how some of you all approach it and have some questions. I realize that I can do some digging in here and find what I need to know but I ask for your patience and maybe some light on the subject. So these are pretty much what I’m curious about. 

First off I have no idea the amount in which to get started. I’m pretty sure people sensitivity are much different but what is the “common” amount or where would be a good amount to start micro dosing?
Also how do some of you approach it? Do you take one dose a day or a certain amount throughout the day? Is it daily or are some of you doing it in such a way where it’s only a certain amount of days through the week? I’m sure everyone has their own way of doing it but I’m just curious what the regimen of others is. I appreciate any feed back. Thanks in advance, take care and be safe ✌🏽

""If you and your mind are a tree, then mushrooms extend your roots, and  Lsd will push your branches onwards and upwards. Gotta keep em both in balance imo :)""

[https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/e0jglx/are\_there\_reasons\_to\_microdose\_with\_lsd\_vs/f8f23os?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/e0jglx/are_there_reasons_to_microdose_with_lsd_vs/f8f23os?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

&#x200B;

Last night I had a friend over and we were prepping pills for the next few months microdoses. We chatted about the Stamets protocol and compared it to a Crossfit or any workout. Yes feel free to insert jokes about Crossfit.

Lions Mane is like a protein shake. You will not see benefits in a perceptible way. It helps on a slow and gradual basis but you still take in protein on recovery days.  
Niacin is like a pre-workout.  
The shroom microdose is the workout - you get a definite energy boost that day and a bit of afterglow the next day or two depending on your physiology.

The analogy is close but not perfect as you still may take niacin on non MD days.

&#x200B;

I think when you discuss the topic with friends, this is an analogy that may folks will get on why you do it and how it may benefit them if you are trying to convince them to improve their lives. The more discussion and acceptance we can get on this topic, the closer we will get to removing legal barriers.",80,1544,14,236,0

 I still have positive effects on my off days but I always get the urge to dose again after a day, i think it's my addictive personality.

2019-08-11 17:16:48,"Tried my first microdose of shrooms yesterday, was disappointed.","I was mainly taking shrooms because I wanted to overcome my depression and anxiety. I took 200 mg(0.2g) and headed to the gym. Maybe at the 2 hour mark, I noticed I was giggling a little. I also felt a bit emotionally stable and felt more alert. Music sounded a bit sweeter. All of this could be purely placebo though since I was expecting things.

But it certainly did not last long. The usual boredom of my life returned by the 4th hour mark. Negative thoughts and insecurities are still there. 

After the initial two hours, it was back to business as usual. Same boring depressing life.

I didn't experience much empathy or become in touch with nature. I didn't see beauty in anything or feel like a child. I didn't get any boost in creativity.

Were my expectations too high? Should I up the dose? Should I macrodose? Should I switch to LSD?

The only other med I'm taking is a light dose of finasteride for my hair (0.25 g). I take zinc, magnesium citrate, and vitamin d everyday.

I honestly feel like microdosing is just placebo or at best a very temporary 2 hour boost. I really don't see how this could change one's life.

Today I woke up and there was no afterglow from yesterday. I feel like shit just as much as I always have.

Does taking the 4 aco dmt interrupt my microdose schedule? Or can I take the microdose of LSD today since they are 2 different chemicals?

Circumstances won't matter, but I mistakingly and unknowingly took microdoses (Range 0.2-0.5 mg) of Amphetamine Sulfate two weeks ago around Christmas,one each day for three days straight. Since then I feel constanly wired, reminiscent of an Adderall dose, but in an uncomfortable way. But most importantly I've been unable to sleep properly for over a week now. I pinned down the issue and tried to ensure the best sleep quality possible those last few days, to no avail. I've only been sleeping around 4-5 hours per night, have difficulty falling asleep and can't get back to sleep after I wake up in the middle of the night.

Did I fuck up my receptors permanently here? 

I read some reports of microdosing amphetamines and sensitization and  there doesn't seem to be an obvious solution for de-sensitize receptors. 

I was thinking of either:

* Take high doses Adderall (70mg+) daily for a while to try and desensitize the receptors.

* Try a course of BPC-157 to try and bring back normal dopamine tolerance, and reverse the reverse tolerance

Have a hard time getting things done, are stressed, pressed, couldn't sleep and stuff like that. Its such a big problem for her, that she is only working half time.

2018-03-06 21:59:41,I suspect i have gotten something else than lsd. Anyone know what it could be? DOB?,"I've been tanking a lot of LSD as MD with no break, so I noticed that effect was a bit less and since I had used up the last ones I took a break for 2 weeks almost. Then I tried the new LSD I bought from darknet and it felt like nothing. First I thought it was too weak. It was supposed to be 175 ug each but seemed to be closer to 50. So I tried higher doses went from 6 to 10 to 15 and yesterday I even tried what was supposed to be 50 ug.

The body load became stronger and stronger, but I didn't become smarter. I never got that insane brilliance that LSD usually gives. Instead I got a feeling of dizziness even on very low dosages. it felt like wobbling sideways and the vision became much brighter, and usually on higher dose of real LSD the place rather become darker, like some underwater-feeling I guess. I also felt something back of my throat that I felt a lot at another time when I tried some shady ""LSD"". 

My guess is that it is DOB, but I am pretty much a noob on drugs.  One reason I guess that is because the day after dose was almost as creative and I know DOB work for a longer time than LSD. But the effect was nowhere close to LSD. On LSD I am a genius whose every thought inspire new insights on other areas.

I also felt a bit more speeded on this drug.

The thing that don't fit the DOB description is that the feeling of dizziness was almost instant.

Anyone that tried MD DOB or similar and LSD and can point out the difference? ",83,1457,16,291,0

2017-11-12 00:20:28,15ug in the morning—60ug 14 hours later.,"I’ve been experimenting with microdosing. This morning I woke up about one hour before I normally would. I got up, took my 15ug microdose, and went back to bed for another hour and a half. 


The results were fairly underwhelming throughout the day. This may be attributed to a variety of factors, including a 2mg etizolam pellet I took before bed. 


The circumstances in my life very rarely allow me to venture above a microdose.  Well tonight, about 14 hours after my original dose, an opportunity arose. I wasn’t looking to get too crazy, so I took a total of 60ug (three of the 20mcg blotters from Lysergi). I had had a few drinks up until this point.


As I’m about to close up this post, I’m roughly 40 minutes into the additional 60ug dose. I feel nothing as of yet, but I’m prepared to have a mini-trip soon. It will be interesting to see how much my morning dose affects my current dose, tolerance-wise.

2017-09-08 21:22:38,first day microdosing gone wrong,"So I've tripped before and wanted to give microdosing a try. I divided a supposedly 150ug tab in 13 little pieces of various sizes. I tried a medium to big one, which I estimated should be +/-12ug in theory, 10ug if the tab is a little lighter than the advertised density. 

I took it at 8 am and really didn't think much about it after. But one hour later, I felt the regular comeups effects. Tingly sensations in the legs and arms, tight neck (this kills me I hate it) and a clear ""heaviness"" in my head, but really not that pronounced. Theses sensations peaked 3h after taking my dose. I could still function totally normally but the body load I described was unpleasant. at noon, 4h in the trip, I had to get to work, and my pupils were visibly dilated. Hopefully no one noticed. 

My mood was definitely lifted, I was more emotional, found stuff more amusing. 

I'll retry microdosing with half of whatever I took last time two weeks later as I plan on tripping next week-end. If I can't find the right dosage with cut pieces I'll try with volumetric but it seems way too complex though.

Pretty sustained focus throughout the day. Did not feel nearly as much of the 'feeling empathy' and communication benefits I was hoping to have. Stayed in focus. About 4 or 5pm i started feeling pretty sad, almost emotional like i was going to cry. 

Had a great day overall, although wished I felt more empathy/natural conversation abilities (I'm pretty good but not great generally speaking, although sometimes i feel very confident!)

Highly recommend it and liked it.

2016-10-31 05:46:48,Zhuan Falun (Turning The Law Wheel),"Hi all,

I've come across a fascinating book that talks about high level spiritual things from a scientific perspective. This book is intriguing as it talks about many similar things to what people in mystical and psychedelic states mention such as seeing into parallel dimensions and interacting with beings from other worlds etc.

This book is called Zhuan Falun and it is from the Buddha Law School of Cultivation however it is not Buddhism the religion or Daoism the religion, it's something more profound. It seems to me to be more of a spiritual science as many of the terms and concepts in the book are talked about in a scientific down to earth manner instead of flowery mystical prose which I found very refreshing.

Now here is where it gets interesting, this book talks about the following things:

● Other Dimensions - Levels Of Dimensions spanning into the microcosm and also outwards into the macrocosm

● The Soul - It talks about people having a Master soul and a subordinate soul which is hidden from you but is at a more advanced level then you, it states some people have more then one Subordinate soul and some are of not of the same sex as you i.e males having a female subordinate soul etc.

● Microcosmic worlds - This concept was very far out but it talks about there being worlds within you, countless worlds. Similar to our world with life , water, animals etc. An analogy is zooming an an atom within one of your cells and realizing at that level of magnification it is just like our solar system. Then zooming into a single particle in that world and finding out it too is a vast world, apparently the level it can go onwards like this is beyond imagination.

● Supernatural Abilities - In the book they mention that everyone has them it is just that they have atrophied. It goes into depth about this topic. Some abilities that are mentioned are precognition, retrocognition and remote vision.

● The 3rd Eye - Talks about how at the front part of our pineal gland there is a complete structure of an eye there. Modern science calls it a vestigial eye but in the cultivation world they say this eye just naturally exists like that and it can be activated allowing one to pierce through this dimension and see other dimensions. It talks about how there are many levels to this 3rd eye and it goes into great depth about it.

● Thoughts - This part was amazing. It talks about how a human brain is just a processing plant. How the real you is actually your soul, it's like your whole body and brain is just a vehicle and that the true commands are issued by your master soul, but this master soul is very tiny and it can switch positions while inside you and it can also expand and shrink. It can move from your brain to your heart and to other parts of your body and it is 'he' who calls the shots.

Your brain is just the factory which your master soul sends his cosmic commands to which then create the forms of expression and communication we use such as speech, gestures, etc. These are just a few things that are covered but there are many many other things which blew my mind when I read it because of how it resonated with some of the mystical experiences people sometimes have, especially the multidimensional nature of reality and how all of them are hidden in our day to day perceptions of the world.

If this sounds interesting to anyone you can grab a copy of the book here:

2016-08-09 20:51:10,Rediscovering my true self - is microdosing the answer I've been looking for all along?,"I feel lost. Unable to express my true potential which I **know** is buried inside me. I've isolated myself from others and the social interactions which I yearn for seem pointless; how can I expect to get to know someone when I don't even know myself? 

I hit the realisation that I am not the person I was intended to be about 3 years ago. During my childhood and early teens, I had a FIRM SENSE OF SELF... I was outgoing, happy, and confident with adequate self-esteem - all of which are essential qualities for joyful living.

Feelings of anxiety, depression, guilt and deflation jump started me into action as I began to loose myself. During the past 3 years I've taken many different routes of healing which include; therapy, CBT, antidepressants, meditation, copious amounts of self improvement (which I continue to this day), and I've followed a strict diet regime throughout all of this. I'm 21 and I don't drink, smoke or indulge in any recreational drugs - I have however in the past.

I'm fortunate to have retained the high ambition I carried during my younger years. Its helped me (somehow) stumble to where I am now despite bouts of depression and self created adversity. I study business at one of the best business schools in the UK and I managed to achieve a great grade whilst struggling with the dreaded antidepressant side affects. Right now however, keeping up with studies and following my dreams is like walking on thin ice due to where my headspace is currently at and that ice may crack at any moment (as it has in the past).

I'm ranting on and most of this is probably irrelevant. **What I'm trying to say is; is microdosing the key I've been looking for all along? The key to keeping me grounded, the key that opens the door of self-rediscovery?**

**I should mention that I took my first microdose of LSD at 10-13mcg this morning. It was purchased it from a credible source on the dark web and I trust it's authenticity**. At this dose I felt more lethargic than usual and quite irritable. Overall I found how it made me feel to be uncomfortable and after todays experience I'm starting to doubt the drugs healing potential **to me personally** when it comes to the predicament I find myself in. I'm aware of it being greatly beneficial for a vast amount of people so I plan to give it a few more tries according to James Fadiman's guide, maybe at a slightly lower dose.

Can anyone hear shed light on my situation and whether microdosing is a beneficial route for me to take? Thank you for taking the time to check this post out and thanks in advance to anyone who replies, **it means alot!**

The chance of it leading to schizophrenia isn't really something I would worry about, it is a risk factor though. I had also considered how to reduce ""paranoia"" in moderate to mild schizophrenia patients.

2021-07-09 10:08:10,Online psilocybin research participation! (re-post)," 

Hey guys,

I am recruiting participants for a study investigating the effects of magic mushroom use on aspects of attention and emotion recognition. These specific aspects of attention and emotion recognition play a crucial role in the onset and maintenance of various mental health disorders and addictions. There is evidence to suggest that psilocybin - when combined with therapy - can improve recovery from such issues. The main aim of this study is therefore to see whether psilocybin assisted therapy is having these increased benefits through these mechanisms.

PLEASE READ

\*\*\*Participating in this study does not include taking magic mushrooms nor will any form of magic mushrooms be provided. This experiment only involves the completion of online, computer-based tasks.\*\*\*

\*\*\*This study will use a between-subjects design (comparisons are made between recent magic mushrooms users and non-users). You do NOT have to have taken magic mushrooms before to participate\*\*\*

The experiment:

The experiment will include an information sheet, consent form, a demographics questionnaire, followed by two online computer-based tasks, and will 30 minutes at the most to complete.

\*\*\*you must be on a laptop/computer, it won't work on a phone\*\*\*

If you are interested in taking part, please follow the link below where you will be taken to the experiment and provided with more information about the study.

2021-06-14 06:01:16,Is Lion's Mane the same as a Psychedelic Shroom?,Basically what the headline says. I'd just like to know if Lion's Mane is considered the same as psylocibyn shrooms and if it's a good idea to take a Lions Mane capsule whilst still sticking to my MD regimen. Someone said on this sub the other day that your brain becomes desensitized to MDing the longer you take it. Does this mean I should take them separately? Does anyone have any personal experience with the benefits of Lions Mane and how it helped them? thanks,48,467,9,85,0
2018-07-19 05:02:57,Is it safe to do Kundalini Yoga while microdose?,"The kundalini yoga that I do is quite intense. The guru who initiated me into this yoga told me to keep safe distance between intoxicants like alcohol and the yoga (9-10 hrs). Since psychedelics are illegal, I can't ask him about this. And I know that he'll say if I keep doing this yoga I won't require any psychedelics microdosing.

If you're like me, then you might be enjoying the effects of microdosing while working out. 

It feels great. More focus. More motivation. Better intensity. Heavier lifting. Longer cardio. All of these things are obviously huge for working out, but don't push yourself too hard like I keep doing.

Please stick to your regiment as usual. Push yourself and increase intensity yes, but don't start benching 150 lbs instead of your usual 100 lbs just because you're microdosing.

2022-05-04 05:31:03,Low dose psyclobin,"Just read a few article on Medscape regarding psychedelic low dosing.  Researchers and psychiatrists have done quite a few studies with amazing outcomes. They all seem to be in agreement to legalize natures medicine. Native peoples of North and South America have been using these substances for about 3000 years with no side effects. Meanwhile big Pharma keeps pushing their poisons for $$$$. One of the studies was for medication resistance depression and PTSD. Using brain scans, they examined the receptors in the patients brains before and after ingesting low doses of Psyclobin . The results were astonishing. The brains of those who took the psyclobin had completely rewired their receptors , and this is just two doses taken at 2 week intervals. The other controlled group was given Escilopram  (Lexapro ) on a daily basis and their was no changes recorded on the scans. Some members of the study group taking the psyclobin had completely eradicated their resistant major depression with no side effects.

time for mainstream doctors in neuropharmacology rethink their practices. Hopefully they will be legal to prescribe, and help so many patients.. they also noted that it works for other mental health issues like PTSD, cancer obtained depression, and anxiety. Mother Nature put these plants on our earth for a reason!  If 75% of the reasearchers and psychopharmacologisets, there happens to be some truth behind the studies. I do hope legalization of these substances alongside physiological treatment with help the people in need?

we already have a few clinics here in Montreal that are allowed to use a ketamine for PTSD. And major depressive order.Of course this is done in clinic and under observation.",18,1719,3,278,0
2021-08-26 17:35:38,Brown sperm caused by microdosing?,"tldr; Anyone else experienced brown sperm from microdosing?  


I've been microdosing for about a month and a half and have been really impressed with the improvements to my mental health so far. I fully intend to continue dosing going forward. However, about 2 weeks ago I noticed that my sperm was partly brown. I immediately made an appointment for a full sexual health screening. However something came up, and I was unable to attend.   


The discoloration seemed to go away by itself, but yesterday I noticed that my sperm was almost entirely brown. I belive the amount of brown discoloration could be linked to the amount of time between ejaculations, but I'm speculating. I have read on here that some people have noticed a blue tinge to their sperm, but has anyone seen their sperm turn almost entirely brown?   


I'm only posting on here to rule out the possibility of the microdosing causing this, and to see if anyone else has experienced anything similair. I am aware it could be caused by an infection.",34,1017,5,174,0

2021-04-06 07:06:41,All of us must remember DIET plays a huge roll,"Not to be entirely a party pooper Butt, everyone here with their questions about how ""microdosing changed this and that in a good way, but this other seemingly unrelated thing just magically went so wrong"" 

should remember that mushrooms have the power to change our mood, in a good way, last thing you do in a hedonic place is to take care of your diet

next thing you know everything gets whacked 

the gut microbiota changes overtime, you don't feel your flora changing from day to day, but when you do is because is very damaged and you might have leaky gut

which will take several months to heal, 

take it or leave it, I know what I'm taking about, and I also know that only good reports on microdosing or psyches in general get upvoted, and the few people that will later have problems with their gut will not even know, or take months to figure it out",46,861,10,159,0
