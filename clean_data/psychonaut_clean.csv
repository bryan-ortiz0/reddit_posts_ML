For example today some really good things happened to me that i did not even expect . But i felt this extreme sense of sadness ,disbelief and guilt .

2023-06-16 20:17:45,People get Ego death mixed up with a breakthrough/enlightenment,"There‚Äôs a difference between a breakthrough and an ego death which so many people mix up.

With a breakthrough you do not completely dissolve your ego which can happen during the peak of trip. Sorta like when you take shrooms and your inner child comes out. You take down your mask that you‚Äôve built for society. You learn about your inner psychological problems and what causes them.

With a real ego death, you lose complete self identity of who you are. Hence the the word death. You literally feel like you have died and you are stuck in this infinite time realm in which you will never come back. You can‚Äôt feel any emotions from other people and have no sense of logic. It just feels like insanity. I remember I had no sense of direction of what to do next. I just sat in a bed thinking I‚Äôll never see my family ever again.

Once again, the only thing I appreciate was coming out of that trip alive. I‚Äôve had many break throughs with psychedelics which are 10000% times more worth it than getting an ego death.

The truth is that you will learn more about yourself in the outside world rather than just tripping balls in your head. But that‚Äôs gonna offend those who are in their tripping phase right now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",63,1214,9,224,1

2023-06-16 17:32:59,Microdosing uncomfortable effects,"I have been microdosing for a week now, 1 gr of truffles every other day. It hasn't been a nice experience and i'm not sure what to do about it.

My intention was to find out if i could relieve some of my ADHD symptoms. I'm not taking any meds, other than a B12 supplement.

1st dose: kinda felt out of it & a harder time starting tasks, irritability, a need to be alone, but then productivity increased

2nd dose: irritability, worrying, nervous, extreme emotions, but more productivity and a desire to learn and do things

3rd dose (today): no productivity anymore, feeling overwhelmed by tasks and stressed

I haven't experienced any of the nice effects i've read about. For a few days i had high productivity, but that's gone now too. The thing is that before starting this, i was pretty worryfree and hadn't experienced that irritability or anxiety for a long time. I feel like old feelings from the past are being brought up again.

I'm a spiritual person and believe that shrooms have lots of wisdom so it must be trying to tell me something? I don't know whether to keep going, adjust the doses or just quit. Maybe microdosing isn't for me.

2023-06-16 17:02:39,I‚Äôve been experimenting with psychedelics this summer. Wow!,"So ever since the summer started I‚Äôve had some free time to explore psychedelics a little bit. I‚Äôve always heard they can be very therapeutic and I felt like I could better myself by indulging.

Anyways, all I can say is wow! It‚Äôs taken me some time to really reflect on my trips and I think I‚Äôm getting somewhere. 

Not too long ago I took a really strong dose of mushrooms with the intent of finding some solutions to my problems. I also did the same with LSD around 2 weeks after that. Also did a couple more trips with lesser doses. Anyways...

Psychedelics I feel like have legit rewired my brain and changed my thought patterns for the better. I‚Äôve had a lot of problems with self-doubt, negativity, not knowing how to handle my emotions, anxiety, depression, not feeling empathy for people, etc. Human brain bullshit basically. 

I feel as if those problems are slowly getting better because of the psychedelics. I‚Äôve kept a note page on my phone of thoughts that have come up when I‚Äôm tripping or reflecting on my trips.

I‚Äôve never felt right talking to therapists about my problems, so I think using psychedelics for their therapeutic benefits now and again is a great tool for me. 

I‚Äôd like to share some of my thoughts and realizations that I‚Äôve had recently. Just to get my words out there and share and to maybe motivate some of you guys.

Here we go: 

-When we can see ourselves more clearly, we see others more clearly, making it easier to be kind!

-If you‚Äôre not content with yourself, change yourself. You‚Äôre the only one in your shoes living your life. 

-Happiness is a choice it‚Äôs not based on circumstances. Anyone can choose to be happy! You just gotta do it. 

-Life is what you make it. No one else is living your life. Make the absolute fucking best of it because why not? 

-The only thing you truly lose in life is time. Use the limited time you have for the best. Don‚Äôt put things off, act now! We‚Äôre in the now, so do it now. 

-Nike Just Do it! Actually motivating asf. Don‚Äôt get caught up in the bullshit just do what you wanna achieve. Nothing can stop you but your own mind truly.

-If you believe you can achieve

-The mind is a human's worst enemy. 

-We‚Äôre in control, so get on a fucking roll!

-Surround yourself around good people. Good people bring good vibes and good vibes bring great things.

Depression is for sure a bitch and that's been one of my worst enemies. I really do believe I can handle it a LOT better now. I hope it's better accepted for therapeutic benefits in my lifetime. I know so many people that would benefit from these profound and amazing drugs. I do have friends that definitely abuse psychedelics, but that's on them. That's part of the beauty of life; the fact that we can all do what we want truly.

Also side note, it‚Äôs made me also realize that I‚Äôve abused the fuck out of weed ever since I first started smoking (3+ years non stop every day all day type beat) so I‚Äôve been taking a break on that. Weed truly makes you feel content with things you shouldn‚Äôt be content about. I won't forever stop smoking weed, but for the time being, I‚Äôm gonna be as sober as a bee just to see the benefits. Weed will always be there when I need it!",59,3208,8,592,1
2023-06-16 16:32:54,Dangers high psychedelic doses? Felt death and chain of thought loops on 10 gram trip (not doing it again lol),"I‚Äôm the type of person who only uses psychedelics every month or two, but the other day i took an extremely high dose that was pretty scary and eye opening. It was pretty dumb and i had some delusional thoughts before coming back down to earth and calming myself down.

I scaled 10 grams and ate all of them. I started tripping hard and looking around my room everything looked like it was melting, especially the gallon of water on my nightstand. Music sounded great but then i caught myself in thought loops and then felt myself dying and traveling between different dimensions. I then felt God and Satan both speaking to me, until i felt myself die again and then i felt myself in hell mentally, everything in my room looked dark and i was caught in a chain of thought loops. I couldn‚Äôt think clearly and for about an hour i thought i was either dead or my brain was fried. 

It was a scary trip but taught me i need to stop being so ignorant to danger, be more disciplined and be more calculated with risks i take. On the plus side, when i started coming out of the peak i felt as if i‚Äôd transcended and became more aware of some of my mental and spiritual flaws and it felt like a regular shroom high for another 3 hours or so (bright colors, wavy visuals, amplified sounds) until i came down. It was scary and i won‚Äôt do it again because i don‚Äôt want to lose my mind in an altered state, but i learned a lot. That being said, i think 10 grams is extremely too high of a dose. I‚Äôve just decided to take a break and from this point forward, light to moderate doses only and cut my use back to every 3-4 months.

I‚Äôve had quite a few experiences with both lsd, shrooms, mdma, and once with salvia but i am curious if anyone‚Äôs else has experienced this??",110,1756,20,336,1

2023-06-16 13:27:05,Self reflection trip changed my outlook on multiple things.,"I won't go into details as trying to describe a trip is like drawing a rainbow in black and white... 

But things I've realized are: 

¬∑ processed foods are bad and lack nutrition 

¬∑ drinking coffee like water is not good 

¬∑ smoking is disgusting, how did I never acknowledge it was numbing my senses. 

¬∑ I have some sort of dental problem that needs looking at by a dentist 

¬∑ Fruits, veggies and salad taste absolutely amazing 

¬∑ Meat is less appealing to me now, smells like death (not happy about this one but I can get behind not eating animals tbh)

¬∑ Try anything, new music, films, genres, books, foods and drinks etc. My entire music taste has grown so much, I listened to an entire album of orchestral symphonies one night and it was beautiful. 

And most importantly, your own mind is all that matters, if someone else is in a bad mood or not quite 100% there is no need to let it get to you, continue being happy, continue making jokes and being you, nobody should hold the power to effect your mood for more than a moment. 

Treat everyone in a way you would like to be treated and listen to your own body, if you're hungry or hot, actually listen. 

Much love everyone!",59,1188,9,220,1

2023-06-16 12:20:38,stupid humanity,"
I'm proud to be awake
wanna stop my ascension
'Cause they know I'm gonna win

My soul is pure strong energy
I'm on the moon like neil armstrong
I'm not a dad but I take my kids out

in the simulation i play the sims
Metatron doesn't want me in the movie
They do it because I make them glitch
I'm a real gamer, you're just a script

Stuck in the dome, they think it's a globe
I would tell my kids to become their own idol
When you're real you don‚Äôt need people when you're real everyone abandons you
My rap makes you uncomfortable because you know you're fake

I'm a real Aryan if you're a fake I don't care
My dark matter energy in my blood is boiling
That's bitch ass big pussies would sell their ass for sums
too chaotic for them, no, they're not men
This female dog want me 'cause she sent my pheromones
When I dream I change reality
So the archons send me their best soldiers
They know I've been learning for thousands of years

So he does everything for me to put me down
I turn into a super saiyan and I keep this form
Humans watch me like I'm a star
The reptiles see in me that I am their worst nightmare
They don't have the choice to read my thoughts so I bully them as a telepath

Real since kindergarten and it ain't about to change
They harassed me, my energy is increased tenfold
My hate no longer controls me but it cheated me

They say I'm the best I'm not even at the peak
I fill my stomach but I don't empty my balls
I will not get married, they are the slaves of their wives
You know they succubus so I don't need no bitch

If she wants my dick, the energy must be divine
I already told you to be too real, it doesn't pay
So I play ignorant like I throw a human
Yet he's all in pain, I don't need drugs to feel good
You still simp on this bitch I already said for her your nothing
And I feel like Eren yeager I will have to assassinate them

My energy is so high I'm really animated
I'm not a fictional character but I'm an action figure
And I roll myself another pestle but it's just another distraction
I raise my vibration I'm a threat to society
I didn't let myself be programmed so now I'm the enemy
And I swear on my soul that I will never sell it
And to increase in size I drop the ashes",15,2212,2,444,1

2023-06-16 11:36:19,I need to get this off my chest (Bad Trip) üò¢,"So I‚Äôm a pretty advanced psychonaut. I mainly stick to shrooms. I just feel like it‚Äôs a bit more natural and safer than most other psychedelics. I used to experiment in HS, but stopped for awhile while I was in the military. After I got out of the military, I began having severe depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. The VA treated me with tons of anti depressants, sleeping pills, and anxiety medication. I would then supplement that with handles of whiskey‚Ä¶ slowly killing myself until one bad night after downing a bottle of scotch and sleeping pills I began chopping up my body with a knife I keep by my bed‚Ä¶ luckily I was too far gone to add too much pressure and my gf at the time found me in a pool of blood‚Ä¶ she was a nursing student so we didn‚Äôt go to the hospital. It was a big wake-up call, so I started making changes in my life. I read online that mushrooms were being used to treat PTSD so I got off the meds, stopped drinking as much, and started experimenting. Over 100 trips later here I am, completely cured and feeling better than I have in my entire life! Well, maybe not cured, but definitely in a much healthier place. I‚Äôm married now, to a different woman, own two homes, extremely respected and liked at work, and working on having children. Lately I‚Äôve been tripping every Wednesday after work. Just a scheduling thing. I‚Äôm pretty advanced so I do heroic doses. No less than 1/4 oz. Last week I fucked up. In my mind, I was just so confident in myself and my ability to handle large doses. I really thought there was no limit for me. I took a 1/4 of a weaker strain, and it was pretty chill to say the least, nothing crazy. Just had a good talk with the wife before she went to bed. I told her I‚Äôd probably do some more just to have the visuals and head change I was looking for. So I did a 1/4 of my stronger stuff. Albino penis envy‚Äôs if you‚Äôre wondering. As I was preparing, I decided to take out a large one, and then another larger cap. I figured I should probably chill out cause I had stuff to do the next day. Oh, and btw I just started changing up my prepping method. I now chop em up and let them soak in lime juice for 20 min. Then I add water and sugar and chug it. üòÇ I know I‚Äôm crazy, but i helps it kick in faster and makes it shorter, but more intense. So after 20 min it starts to kick in and I‚Äôm feeling fkn amazing. I‚Äôm like shit, I shoulda just done more, so I eat a couple more. Then for some reason I prepare another 1/4 oz drink‚Ä¶ all together it was about 20g. As soon as I chugged it, I realized what I had just done‚Ä¶ panic began to set in, and I went back and forth for 20 min deciding if I should ride it out or eject. As my eyes began to roll into the back of my head I kicked myself out of it, ‚Äúnope, nope, nope‚Äù I told myself. Stumbled over to the kitchen and began chucking water. I then ran to the bathroom, shoved my fingers down my throat, and began to get it out of me. I really thought I might die and never see my wife again. Maybe not from poisoning because it‚Äôs almost impossible to OD on shrooms, but kidney failure, seizures, coma, or complete psychosis‚Ä¶ almost thought about calling EMT, but after each purge I felt a little better so I knew I was on top of it. Eventually I got enough out and the trip ended. I honestly felt like a million bucks, like nothing ever even happened. Woke my wife up and we had a talk about what just happened and how I fucked up. She was very supportive, and I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love her. I told her I‚Äôd never mess up like that ever again. Well‚Ä¶ here we are‚Ä¶ again‚Ä¶ a week later. As my wife went off to work I prepared a little over 8g of penis envy, chugged it, and kissed her goodbye. I told myself ‚Äúoh, 8g, np. As long as I don‚Äôt do any more like last time.‚Äù It started off fine, but an hour in I didn‚Äôt feel right. Idk if I was still traumatized from the last trip, but my mind began to unravel‚Ä¶ I made some tea and sat in a dark room trying to meditate, but that didn‚Äôt work, so I decided to eject again. This time I waited longer so they really started taking affect. I got a lot out but was still tripping pretty hard. I forgot who I was, how my hands worked, and at one point I thought my leg was blown off from the war‚Ä¶ I was literally unraveling and had no concept of space or time. I got enough up to manage a phone call to my wife at work. I told her in a calm, deliberate way to please come home and help me. To please not rush and get in an accident. I let her know I was through the hard part, but needed her to come soothe me. We talked the whole 45 min it took her to get back and it finally died down just before she got back. Like nearly instantaneous relief. We spent the whole day talking about what happened. And I tried to put into words what I just went through. One crazy thing that I remembered was, as I was purging, I was suddenly transported back to when I was a 10 year old child and my grandfather was teaching me how to paint a fence. Obviously not physically transported, but in my mind it was so vivid. I could almost see, smell, taste, and hear everything just as if it was happening all over again‚Ä¶ I actually told myself ‚Äúomg, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm vomiting through space and time.‚Äù I‚Äôm much better now. Honestly I felt amazing after. Again like nothing ever even happened. I do catch myself staring into space, struggling to remember everything that was going through mind, not in a bad way. Just me trying to make sense of what just happened‚Ä¶ idk, there‚Äôs no real point to this post. I have no questions nor do I need any answers. This is just journaling for my own benefit. Help me process. If you‚Äôd like to comment you can. I‚Äôm pretty intelligent, if I can still say that after all this, and very emotionally mature, so don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gonna goat me into some internet argument or make me feel bad with an insult. One last thing. I‚Äôm not giving up on shrooms. I feel like it‚Äôs still therapeutic for the traumas I‚Äôve experienced in my life. Honestly I feel like I‚Äôm mentally sharper after. I do struggle with memory a bit after getting hit by a rocket. I‚Äôm just going back to 1/8ths after this ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm also a great listener, so please feel free to unload, and maybe I can share some wisdom üßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",44,6243,11,1223,1

The battle between the antonyms has been going since the first proton hit the first electron.

The tension is inherently nonjudgemental. It is humans who have understandably assigned judgement. Pain being bad and pleasure being good.

It‚Äôs not always that obvious. What judgement would you assign for chaos vs order?


Chaos can be good and bad and order can be good and bad.


This rivalry is eternal, is it pointful? 


It may seem pointless, with each time good or evil is vanquished it inevitably reappears.

Apply this to your emotions.


It is not meaningless, think of it this way,


Each time good wins it goes more to the right, and each time bad wins it goes more to the left.  


Each time one side reaches a limit think of it as a check point that is more easily reached the second time around.


Think about the point of life,


There is a third option outside of good and evil.


Both good and bad are working towards the same goal in this sense?


I‚Äôd ask the question of what the third option is but I know nobody would guess it and I know nobody will understand it when I state it.


You will say you understand it but then I‚Äôll ask you to explain it and you‚Äôll be far off.


It‚Äôs fine I will still share it.


The third force of nature is nothingness.

The Devil and god work together within the human to prevent nothingness. The Devil functions as a last resort set of characteristics to keep part of oneself alive.

Now, this fight between the antonyms is not pointless.


What‚Äôs the point?


We‚Äôve already learned it, the more one side wins the more it extends further in that direction.


This is a call to action. This is a cry for help. This is a demand for battle.


What the fuck did you do today to advance life?

2023-06-16 04:48:18,Curious about my tolerance and would like input from others!,"So I‚Äôve had only four trips, 3 psilocybin, and 1 lsd. I‚Äôve been sitting on some questions for roughly half a year to a year that I finally feel comfortable sharing in this community. 

First question being, the first time I took mushrooms, was around 2.5 g in capsules (pill form), and with two experienced friends. They began tripping very hard, telling me the high was coming on stronger and faster than usual while I didn‚Äôt feel anything. It took two hours for me to begin feeling effects, and ultimately had the most wonderful first trip experience. Has anyone else experienced a ‚Äòdelayed‚Äô trip before? I‚Äôll also mention we drank some tea that was supposed to enhance the trip, or break the mushrooms down more easily? I can‚Äôt remember what the tea was exactly.

Second trip was my first experience with lsd. Me, being arrogant figured it would be exactly like my only experience with a completely different drug (haha I know that‚Äôs silly after the fact). Total experience was great but was very overwhelmed during the peak and not sure if I got into a time loop but felt as if I was continuously experiencing the moment I began to feel the effects, as well as every second after that layering on top of the current at the same time, as if I was experiencing multiple different points in time all at once and adding new ones as time passed. My buddies again were very experienced and super supportive and comforting. I haven‚Äôt tried lsd since because I get a nervous feeling of when I have the chance, I would like to but don‚Äôt want to bring a negative mindset into the trip. Does anyone have any thoughts that could be beneficial?

Lastly, holy cow my third time experiencing a psilocybin trip was again with capsules, I only had two grams this time but I was blasted into an entirely different trip space. I realized I was in for a doozey when I closed my eyes, still seeing what I was just looking at, and my field of view wrapped into a circle with the left and right sides meeting in the bottom. That image began to layer on top of itself towards me making me think that my eyes were still open and my friend in front of me was walking toward me, it wasn‚Äôt until I opened my eyes that I realized what it was.  I ended up having the most earth shattering closed eye visuals of fractals and different spaces every time I closed my eyes. Again this made me feel overwhelmed (not entirely in a bad way, I still look back on this trip as my favorite) and at some points had to touch my face to reassure myself that my eyes were indeed closed and the vivid visuals were just closed eye hallucinations. Is there a chance I just got my hands on some crazy potent mushrooms or do I just have a weird reaction. 

If you‚Äôve got this far thanks for reading, and I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

2023-06-16 02:24:14,Trip report. 660ug+6g of Albino PE shrooms with my gf.,"Set/Setting- The trip took place inside our house. We had been planning this trip for about a week and finally found a day to do it. We cleaned the entire house in the morning and made sure we had plenty of snacks, fruit, and drinks for the trip. We grabbed our 30+ super soft Minky Couture blankets and the couple robes we have from Minky as well. For some context we both get really cold while tripping and the Minky blankets are very soft, warm, and kind of heavy. 

Dose- 6 110ug gel tabs and 6g of APE each

~6:30- Dropped the tabs and took a 2-3 dabs each

~6:45- Starting to feel the initial effects

~7:00- Since the LSD kicked in so fast we took the shrooms. We also put on some music. 

~7:30- I took a dab and when I exhaled I massive rush of euphoria hit me and I fell back onto the pile of blankets while the visuals started to take over. By this point I felt like I was peaking on 300ug. From this point on time completely went out the window and so did reality. 

As I was laying down I felt myself getting higher and higher. My gf told me we should eat the pineapple we bought. It tasted sooooo good. I stood up from my chair and I started rubbing my hand through the robe I had on and I said ‚Äúohhhhhhh its soooooo soft I need moreeeee‚Äù while laughing hysterically. I then grabbed one 2 blankets and bundled up in them. As soon as I did that my legs gave out from the euphoria and I fell face first onto the blanket pile. As i‚Äôm laying there, the closed eye visuals took over and they were beautiful. 

I rolled over after what I think was a few minutes and open my eyes and the only visuals I had was swirling walls and patterns on the blankets and carpet. Then my gf and I started cuddling and making out. We both got really horny and ended up having sex. I don‚Äôt know how long we did it for but it felt like an eternity. I remember when we started the visuals weren‚Äôt very prominent. As we continued my gf had morphed into the blankets we were laying on. All I could see was the patterns of the blankets shifting and waving around. After a while longer geometric fractals and aztec symbols and entities laid over my vision, so prominent I couldn‚Äôt see my hand in front of my face. With every pump the visuals got more and more intense and I kept repeating the words ‚Äúits so good, its so good, its so good‚Ä¶‚Äù as I felt myself about to finish I was shot out of my body and could see and feel myself pulling out and busting all over her stomach. Right as I bust I get sucked back into my body and get the most insane euphoria and fell backwards onto the blanket pile in complete and pure bliss. When I got up and made it to the bathroom my gf and I cleaned ourselves up and wrapped back up into our robes and stared into the mirror laughing as we watched each other morph into different things and watched the patterns on the checkered and leopard print robes wave around. 

We made it back to the bedroom where the song Young by Vacations begins playing and we lay down on the blanket pile and take some of them and cover ourselves in them. We take a few hits from my dab pen and a few minutes laters we are teleported to an alternate dimension. We have these two blankets on top of us, one is a leopard pattern and the other is a lynx pattern, and all of a sudden we are in what looked like a rainforest and we are jaguars roaming the landscape looking for food. Even though we didn‚Äôt move it felt like we were running through the rainforest chasing animals around. We had no idea who we were and we only knew that we were predators chasing prey. Eventually we snap back to reality and I checked the time. It was only 11:00

11:00- The higher I got the more euphoric I felt, so I took a few more hits from the dab pen. I felt as if I was being lifted up into the air while laying down but in reality I was getting horny. I start looking at my gf and I get even more horny. We could both feel the energy in the room and we‚Äôre both getting aroused. The more we stared at each other the closer to finishing we got. Eventually I could feel my semen starting to flow up my dick so I quickly uncovered myself and undid my robe so I didn‚Äôt get anything on it. After another minute or two of staring into her eyes I bust and she orgasm at the same time. It felt like the most insane thing ever because I didn‚Äôt have to do anything. 

After cleaning up again and getting wrapped back in the robe and under the blankets we laid back down. I felt myself continuing to get high from the weed and my eyes rolled back into my head and I was met with and entity that introduced themselves as a psychedelic goddess. She took me through tunnels on kaleidoscopic fractals with the god like figures lining the walls. Eventually I she brought me to a place she called the acid palace. It looked like the gel tabs I ate. She brought me up the steps and saw that my gf was waiting for me with some children. I was told that it was my potential future life if we stayed together (I am still baffled by this part of the trip because I talked to my gf about it and she had a very similar experience). After I saw this I was thrown into a hole of spiraling colors and I fell back into my body and my eyes rolled back forward. I look over at my gf and she has her eyes closed with a huge smile on her face. Eventually she snaps back and we start ‚Äútalking‚Äù even though nothing we said made sense to either of us. 

We talked for quite a while before we sat up and started jamming out to the music and rolling around on the floor. After a bit I get the need to pee and I get up and grab my phone. I look down at my gf who was still rolling around to the music and see that we completely threw the blankets all over so I remake the pile and lay a few of the trippiest looking ones out on the floor. I go to the bathroom and check the time and its around 2:30. 

~2:30- I get back to the room and I forgot that I spread some trippy looking blankets out so I instantly felt euphoric. I remember taking a blanket and putting it on my shoulders then falling face first and rolling around groaning with happiness. After a few minutes we started spooning under some of the blankets. I felt as if we combined out bodies and became one. We laid there for about 2 hours as we started to come down. My gf suggested we should take dabs and so I got my dab rig and we both took 3 big dabs. I got up to pee and I started to feel very high again. I pee and then go back to the bedroom. I end up standing over the blanket pule rubbing my hand through my robe and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs sooooooooooo sooooooft, I neeeeeed moreee‚Äù. The last thing I remember was stealing the 3 blankets my gf was laying under, putting them over my shoulders, and falling face first onto the rest of the blanket pile. I had the most awkward lagging sensation while I was falling and then next thing I know I wake up the next day around 3pm cuddled up with my gf. My guess is that I completely passed out when I hit the blankets. 

Overall this trip was super intense yet very fun and educational. It help me see that if things continue the way they are going I will marry and have a family with who I think is the most beautiful and loving girl in the world. Please don‚Äôt try this trip if you aren‚Äôt comfortable with high doses and make sure you take all the precautions necessary to guide yourself on the path to a good trip. This trip could have gone south very quickly but thankfully it didn‚Äôt.",54,7437,10,1463,1

2023-06-15 19:56:42,Is vomiting part of the trip?,"Had a second ever trip with 3g of dried shrooms (first time was 2g, very mild trip). The trip was pretty incredible overall but something unexpected happened. I was walking around in nature/remote area when I suddenly had an urge to vomit, there was a small trail branching off the main one where many people pass so I went on the small trail in case I had to puke and just 15 meters down the trail I sat down and tried to force vomiting but nothing came out as I haven‚Äôt eaten anything the night before or in the morning (the trip started around 5am). The nausea instantly went away and as I was sitting there I noticed how beautiful the view is and had a most incredible and profound lesson in how connected everything is, it was like a little theatrical show the universe played out for me and I would‚Äôve missed it if I didn‚Äôt feel like puking and continued walking on the main trail.

2023-06-15 18:06:59,Y'know that feeling when,"Y'know that feeling when you just took a moderate dose of fresh meanies, sitting down in a small room contemplating life. Small? What's that mean? The walls are visible, but they don't *feel* there. Definitely some body load, well maybe it's time to smoke some weed. My friend who took it the same time I did, commented on being able to see into his hands and veins. Another one claims he is riding a ""dragon"", which were the stairs up to the second floor of our rented bungalow. It was the semester break at my uni, but many of us decided to stay on campus instead of going home. We were in the backwaters of Malaysia, amongst aluminum ore mining sites and the long winded palm oil plantations around us.   


We went hunting for psychedelic shrooms in the palm oil plantations where many, many cow pies lay rest. The fellas I was with are total psychedelic newbies, only tagging along coz they were out of booze. We harvested almost half a kilogram of blue meanies(Panaeolus Cyanescens), which we divided between the three of us equally. I had warned them about how strong and different these were from getting drunk, to which the two of them shrugged it off. It's a given, as they're both from jungle tribes in East Malaysia, whom are known to not fear anything. We each drank half of our dose which was steeped in lemon juice for 5 minutes after blending them.   


Next thing you know, one of my buddy is riding on a ""dragon"" while facing a heavy ""storm"". The other was inspecting his hands deeply for about what felt like an hour. Smoking a joint mellowed out the body high, but the uncomfortable feeling just keeps increasing, especially on my palms and skin. Inside, however, felt ticklish and funny. I looked at my trippy friends and gathered them, trying to explain how high we all were. As soon as the sentences left my mouth, we all simultaneously laughed at the same time. It's as if we are all laughing at the same thing, knowingly, without knowing that we knew it. It was so funny, tears was gushing out the corner of my eyes, clouding my vision and snot filled up my sinuses. We laughed for a good 15 minutes or so.   


What happened next was fuzzy, as with all psychedelic experiences, especially during the peak of an experience. I remembered the room we were in expanded and shrunk in size, but the space felt infinite. The music we listened to also ""split"" where we can hear each segment in the music so clearly. When we went out onto the field outside the house, the grass was breathing and the dew glistened in unison under the moonlight, it was beautiful. My buddy even cried about how much he misses his family and how his drinking habit is no good for him. There were some epiphanies that I've gained that night but I've forgotten what they were. Mostly trippy realizations that sounds crazy if I tried to word it out. 

We did not sleep but smoke a ton of weed on the comedown, just talking about how surreal the experience was. The experience gave an uneventful day meaning because it was one of the most enlightening psychedelic experience I've had amongst many other.",24,3097,4,557,1
2023-06-15 17:34:30,I finally got the alcohol trip!,"I did a 2.5g mushroom trip last night and had my first true breakthrough! 

About 2 hours into my trip, I decided to drink a beer to soothe the nerves. I was in the middle of describing what the color purple tastes like to someone as my senses were bleeding together and sipped my beer. (Background, I drink 2-3 8% a night, I can't get actually drunk until my gut revolts, 4 8% and 2-5 5% is an average weekend night)

I began to give a description of the taste of purple when it changed to this overwhelmingly strong chemically taste, like battery acid. At first it didn't register, but when I took another sip I could feel that cold battery taste wash down over my body. As it washed down, it hit my stomach and then I could actually feel what it was doing to my organs, then it branched out and I could feel that cold wave go through every vein and nerve in my body. It actually felt like alcohol was killing me! 

I decided to try another beer, this time a fruity one and the same thing happened. The mushrooms have finally told me what I've been needing to hear, and I'm so thankful! I'm cutting down on the poison from now on guys. I hope my story inspires others!",31,1170,6,224,1

Recently I have been reading books and listening to interviews and podcasts about the whole topic. For about 2 or 3 years I was a heavy cannabis user. From 2019-2021. I very much enjoyed it, it helped me wind down at the end of a long world day, and of course made me more open, introspective etc. Then one day I was doing as I did and was hit with a massive panic attack, when prior to this day, I was never even a generally anxious person, I mean really none at all even in stressful situations I was calm, collected, always able to maintain logical control of my mind and thoughts. This was around June or July of 2021.  Since then I have gone through almost every day with some level of anxiety, multiple more panic attacks since then. Even been put on an SSRI to help. This is unfortunate because I have become very interested in the world of psychedelics and very much considering trying them, at this point what is holding me back is fear of further panic attacks and anxiety related issues.i have been reading about new Therapy interventions with psilocybin so I am also curious about them for this reason as well.

My concern is that my friend has PTSD related to her first husband who was emotionally manipulative and abusive. I have a good feeling that some, if not a lot, of the pain and trauma related to that is going to come up during the experience. I have not had experience with someone with that level of trauma using psychedelics, but given how some of my trauma has manifested during previous trips, I want to make sure I‚Äôm ready to be the best I can be in that situation.

I was wondering if anyone who has had experience trip sitting for someone with PTSD had some tips or suggestions. I know that being a calm, encouraging, engaged and compassionate presence is a good foundation for responding to issues as they come up, but I also want to make sure I have as much preparation as possible to help her through the trip itself.

Pretty much as the title reads. My boyfriend was working and a resident in his building gave him a polka dot bar. He is sober and not familiar with this brand, didn't read the package, and ate the whole thing. He got home in time and I have him set up in the bedroom in the dark with some music, so he's pretty good for now. We decided against going to the ER because that is not the vibe, and we have both tripped a few times in the past so know generally what to expect. 

He's a pretty big guy, any advice on how one whole bar is gonna affect him? He's been sober for about 5 years but he's done shrooms and acid in the past. I blacked out the curtains at his request, got a few good movies qued up if that's what he wants, and I cleaned the house so if he comes out of our bedroom there's not a ton of stimuli around. I wanna make this as easy as possible for him, so any advice at all would be helpful.",76,1211,12,245,1
2023-06-15 10:39:39,Insight: we are just on consciousness experience itself at this very moment (not on any entheogen right now),"So I‚Äôm watching a Russell brand video on YouTube. Link [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ-kbLi_dbA](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ-kbLi_dbA)

And he‚Äôs joking about a scenario where police officer pulls over a car and says to the driver:

‚ÄúDo you realise you and I are just one consciousness experiencing this very moment.‚Äù

And then I flashback to my experiences on ayahuasca and psilocybin. That we are all one. It‚Äôs mad it‚Äôs like a feeling of d√© ja vu and it feels amazing but terrifying at the same time.

We literally are all just one consciousness, experiencing itself at this place and moment, here and now. It reminds me of what Alan watts would say about this, that [you are like a wave, what the whole ocean is doing.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XAvSzC_-4g4)

And then I think of all the past wars, the killings, the badness, everyone who has suffered and died, kings, leaders etc and gone before me. [kind of in the same way Carl Sagan talks about the pale blue dot](https://www.google.com/search?q=carl+sagan+pale+blue+dot+youtube&rlz=1CDGOYI_enES998ES998&oq=carl+sagan+pale+blue+dot+youtube&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30.8816j0j7&hl=en-GB&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:58996064,vid:wupToqz1e2g,st:72)


And then I realise, it was all me, all you, us. The one consciousness. 

And I wonder what would happen if we all realised that in one moment. How would life change and be like?

Honestly, I just had to share this. The realisation when it comes is really sometimes difficult to accept and take. It‚Äôs like a d√© ja vu mind f**ck.

I told the dog that I was just hallucinating, in reality the dog is dead. 

The dog told me that I was dead too and dissipated into the air. The dog was known for its sass, so I'm sure it was just joking with me.

2023-06-15 09:39:18,1 month post LSD overdose,"Hi fellow psychonauts
It‚Äôs been one month since I accidentally took ~2000mcg of LSD. The way I think it happened was I ingested 3 tabs of unknown strength then held some other tabs, forgetting that LSD can go through your skin. I say 2000mcg because it was the most psychedelic-y trip i‚Äôve ever done (I‚Äôve done 15gs of shrooms and broke through on DMT but they don‚Äôt even come close to what I experienced). I then proceeded to have the most horrible trip ever. I felt the LSD trying to rip my sanity and mind away from me. I think the only reason i‚Äôm not in the looney bin is because I can handle gut-punching psychedelic trips. The LSD wanted to take everything from me, it just wanted to hurt me, and I know for certain it did because it was talking to me. It kept saying ‚Äúdie, die, die‚Äù. It‚Äôs like it was fueled off my fear, but due to my ability to handle this sort of stuff, I showed it absolutely no fear, and that pissed it off. It then tried to get me to show fear for the next 12 hours. It showed me the most unspeakable horrors, and I think even with an NSFW tag it would traumatize you. 
It‚Äôs been over a month since this happened, and for some reason i‚Äôm not getting any side effects/PPD whatsoever. Am I okay? I feel okay but it feels like something is just‚Ä¶off.",25,1275,5,245,1

2023-06-15 03:39:06,I have a big problem with DMT and I can't figure out what's going on,"My experience with DMT.... I hope to summarize everything in the most concrete way, since I could really write a book. First of all, my condition before DMT was terrible, after a stage of addiction where I was drunk every day, I spent another stage locked in my room for years, I was definitely a totally incapacitated person due to my mental condition, I have borderline personality disorder. For years no psychiatrist or psychologist could help me, on the contrary it got worse. Until I found Ayahuasca and that completely changed and now I have a fully functional life adapted to society, of course I had to do many ceremonies to achieve that result, not only with Ayahuasca but with bufo, changa and srhooms. I had been out of contact with these medicines for a couple of years until this year something happened and it was like a pathological emotional anchor that took me back to 2016 mentally and it was really very hard to feel the phobias, the crises, the desire to die again, like that. that again I went to the DMT to be able to understand what would happen to me. I have already attended ceremonies with mushrooms and changa, so for the ease of getting it I took that option, although it should be noted that in these ceremonies I was always very cautious with the changa since I had atrocious experiences with the bufo (I vomited foam at the mouth, I was entering a deep and painful existential crisis, I felt like I was dying, my body was immobile but my mind was still active, completely separated from my body, I saw a geometric cage where I was locked up, the pain was so much that I cannot say that I have lived a more emotionally painful experience than that and I don't think it's possible) the shaman told me that this happened because I refused to go into my shadow and that there was something I was resisting, I could never really find out what it was (On second thought, it could be a serious trauma from which I am protecting my head and it is having an impact on my life). That never happened to me with the changa but the first time I tried it I felt a very ugly sensation that I couldn't describe and I felt that I was melting which led to a panic attack, this never happened to me with the drank DMT ; In the subsequent ceremonies I only smoked very little, I barely pulled very little and went through a very strong threshold, it was less and less difficult, and I ended up contacting beings from other places who helped me understand things about myself or work on my emotions. So it happened little by little until now. I ate 2 grams of mushrooms like in those ceremonies, I took a really small dose of changa and mixed it with tobacco so as not to have a bad time (60% tobacco 40% changa), everything was fine, I was listening to these voices that told me that I had to get rid of myself, I trusted myself and took a puff a little bigger than the previous ones, it happened again, like with the bufo, vomiting foam and everything, it was horrible and I wasted like the trip trying to calm down from the panic attack . When I got back to my body I checked the bowl and guys, it was full! I had hardly smoked.
I know that there is something strange, I can feel it in me and I know that this type of experience with DMT is really rare, especially with such small doses and I would really appreciate any ray of light that you could offer me.

2023-06-14 23:29:24,My First Trip Report - 8.25g Mushrooms w/ 50mg THC: ‚ÄúA Void Of My Own Creation‚Äù,"To preface: I will be writing in present tense as things happen up until the point of onset, and once I begin writing in past tense, it is from the post-trip perspective, though I may still try and write as the trip progresses. 

It‚Äôs a beautiful morning. I usually try and sleep in on the weekends I don‚Äôt have my 2 year-old, but always wake up early anyway, today being no exception as I awoke at 6:50am. Today is Friday, May 26th, 2023, and I‚Äôve decided to mark the occasion for the trip I‚Äôll be taking today  by writing My First Trip Report. As a writer and psychonaut, it only makes sense to give it a shot, right?

A bit about me - I‚Äôm 25 years old living in Phoenix, Arizona, & up until July 2022 I had never experienced a psychedelic. I have always been a deeply spiritual person so it‚Äôs intrigued me, but I never had the opportunity to try anything until then. So, I first started this trek into psychedelia last July, taking 1g Psilocybe Cubensis with one 10mg THC edible, that night being solidified as one of the top 3 most amazing experiences of my life to date, and I became instantaneously fixated on building up my dosage to experience true ego death.  
First it was 1g, then 0.5g, 0.7g, 1.25g, 1.65g, 2g, 2.25g, 2.5g, 2.75g, 3g, (all with various levels of THC being consumed) and at the time of this writing my largest dose to date is 4g, taken exactly 2 weeks ago today. I decided that for today‚Äôs Trip I would jump up to 8.25g with 50mg of THC edibles. Because in all honesty, I was expecting 3g & 4g to be as transformative as my very first psychedelic experience last year, but it‚Äôs come up short even though I did begin experiencing ego dissolution at 4g. 

I am now describing the trip in past tense, as it took me some time to completely recollect everything that happened.

I was planning to consume the mushrooms and edibles at 9:30pm, but at about 8:30 (and even after meditating and setting the intention), I began to feel acute anxiety due to the realization that I would be taking a megadose for the first time alone. So I asked a very close friend if she would come be my trip-sitter and she agreed. I explained what my intention was and that I planned to deprive my senses and go lie down naked in the dark once the trip began, but I would still hang out with her for as long as I could prior. These would be crucially beneficial decisions to have shared the plan with her, even though the trip would come to bloom before I even made it to my bed.

After measuring out the full 8.25g, I began to dread the inevitably horrible taste of the mushrooms. To get around it, I put the entire dosage into a food processor and ground the mushrooms down to a fine powder; To my surprise, it still ended up tasting absolutely terrible, even after mixing it all with Nesquik chocolate powder and whole milk. The chocolate milk definitely covered a world of hurt, though. I would follow this up with the THC edibles all in one go.

After chasing the Psilochocolate Milk & edibles with water and sprite, I stripped naked and laid down on the couch. My trip-sitter did not mind my nudity; we are intimately familiar with each other. She sat at my desk and we hung out talking, waiting excitedly. 
Only 15 minutes had passed when the euphoria began to creep into my body, slithering up my legs and into my chest, then filling my whole body in a matter of minutes. I could barely move I was already so blissfully euphoric, to the point I was dissociating due to it. My sitter noticed the change in my demeanor as I sank into the couch catatonically staring at the ceiling, and she started asking me about how I was feeling. I remember being caught off-guard by how rapidly the trip was beginning to happen, not even 20 minutes following consumption. Just after the 24 minute mark, the popcorn ceiling above me began shifting into a massive mandala that spanned the entire ceiling‚Äôs surface, undulating with deep calm. It felt as if it were there the whole time and was only waiting for me to notice it before the true trip began. Once the entire shape formed, the popcorn texturing began to sway like upside down grass affected by non-existent wind, moving in all different directions and getting taller and shorter while also sliding across the ceiling like tiles, tessellating. I picked up my phone to reply to a text to find the phone pulsing, with each pulse moving down into my hand and arm up to my shoulder, like a heartbeat with only one thump.
Then, inexplicably, I started to cry. First a quiet sob, then ugly-crying into a full-blown weep. All these repressed emotions and buried feelings about my failed marriage and my insecurities about being a good father/son/brother/friend/person/musician came to the surface, and I realize now that that was the first time I had even truly cried since I got divorced last year. It felt like the tears couldn‚Äôt stop, like they‚Äôd been wanting to come out for so long that once there was an opportunity, they were running for the hills. My sitter came over and embraced me and let me hold her while I wept, consoling me. Although I don‚Äôt recall speaking, she said I would whimper things like ‚ÄúI just want to be a good Dad‚Äù, ‚ÄúI miss my mom and dad‚Äù, ‚ÄúI miss my sister‚Äù, ‚ÄúI just want to be a good person. I hope I‚Äôm a good man‚Äù, and she said she reassured me whenever I said those things.
By the time I began crying, the time dilation was in full swing, and I was convinced I had been crying for years on end. I was the most exhausted I‚Äôd ever been, but she said I cried for only 15-20 minutes or so, even though I thought I cried my way into my 80‚Äôs. It was during the crying that I began having such intense visual aberrations that I was completely blind and deaf, only able to see with my mind‚Äôs eye, and being unable to use my eyes and ears whatsoever. I was locked inside my head even though my sitter said I was laughing and communicating with her like normal after the crying. I still have no recollection of any conversations we‚Äôd had for the next 5 hours or so. I was lost in a void of my own creation.

At some point she helped me transition into my bedroom, and I do recall sitting on the floor between my dresser and bed, which is a very tight space and just barely wide enough for me to fit. I was in an upright fetal position, but I still couldn‚Äôt see or hear the outside world, only the inside of me and the tetrachrome tapestries in my mind. It was here I realized I was trapped in a loop - I‚Äôm unable to recall exactly what I was saying or what was happening in the loop, but I distinctly remember feeling like the AM supercomputer from ‚ÄúI Have No Mouth, But I Must Scream.‚Äù I knew that I existed and I knew that I was alive, but I couldn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt know WHY I was alive, didn‚Äôt know what I was meant to do, or if my purpose was to just exist. This was pure torture because I truly felt stuck and believed I was dying, triggering the worst anxiety I‚Äôve ever felt as well as an asthma attack. I recognize in hindsight that this must have been when I was peaking because I felt these massive waves flow through me as I was experiencing these strenuously panicked sensations. But after what felt like an eternity of feeling stuck, I could feel the skin on my arms reacting to the cold air of my bedroom and I could register that I was beginning to rip free of the vicious cycle. I was slowly, so very slowly coming out of the loop, and thankfully my sitter pulled me out from where I was sitting and held me on my bed, talking me out of it. She said that I was mumbling incoherent phrases and saying names of the people in my life, including other things like ‚ÄúArizona‚Äù, other random cities and dates, bands that I love, people I miss, books I‚Äôve read, and she said I repeated my daughter‚Äôs name the most. She said at one point my eyes opened and I said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much data. I can‚Äôt process all of it, there‚Äôs too much noise. It‚Äôs too fucking loud in my head. I have to start washing these files or else I‚Äôm gonna have white noise in my eyes. And I don‚Äôt want white noise in my eyes because the universe told me it wouldn‚Äôt pay to get my eyes fixed.‚Äù She said I also had screamed at the top of my lungs several times, smacked my head against the dresser and even tried to climb on the top of the dresser which, thankfully, she convinced me otherwise. She also said I would flail my arms around and punch the bed and that at one point I slapped her, too, but she didn‚Äôt mind. 

At the climax of the trip, I did experience ego death for the very first time. I felt myself die and my body sluffing off of my soul like a snake shed, but instead of fear and anxiety, I was overjoyed and filled with this massive loving glow of the universe‚Äôs embrace. I saw flowers growing in my skeleton and bees making honey in my skull and I wept again, this time in fathomless gratitude while prostrating on my bed with my head in my hands. I had become one with the loving energy of the universe, and the sheer weight and stupor-like pleasure of the oneness I felt made me feel drunken & godlike. It was then I realized that the universe had wiped me clean and I was now newborn. I truly felt I was in control of everything for the first time in my life, and it was because this very universe held my hand and showed me the way. 

The comedown began from here. 

The bulk of the trip was so unbelievably intense that during the comedown I felt completely sober, even though I was still totally tripping. My sitter and I were lying on my bed, and at this point my eyes were absolutely fucked. My depth perception was destroyed, making close things seem VERY far and gigantic, as well as vice versa, all the while experiencing some of the most wild visual aberrations and hallucinations across my bedroom. My hands were comically fat and pulsating electrically, and I had a different number of fingers every time I looked at them. There were tiny whisps and flurries of light racing across my room like toy race cars. The ceiling would drip and stir like primordial soup. I can‚Äôt even begin to describe all that I saw, but it felt like I was on a school playground, but one that‚Äôs up in the stars. And the music, oh my goodness. There was music playing in my ears that I had never heard before, and they were the most beautifully jovial songs I have ever heard in my life. I thought my sitter was playing music on her phone, but she said the room was quiet and then I realized I was hearing all this inside my head. I‚Äôll never be able to replicate what I heard, but to this day I still pinch myself that I got to be lucky enough to hear songs that the universe thought I would enjoy as I came down. And the craziest thing of all was that I no longer FELT human. The best way I can describe it is that I felt like newborn stardust adrift in a cosmic wilderness opening its eyes for the first time, awash with infinite love & basking in the phosphenes.

My sitter‚Äôs face and body was completely distorted, too. She was honestly scary as fuck to look at (which I feel bad saying but I was tripping balls still), but my hands and skin felt the cleanest they‚Äôve ever felt in my life, and I couldn‚Äôt help but touch her skin. It was then I realized that I worked through more than I thought; I genuinely believe that I worked through ALL of my trauma, and that I am now completely Healed and wiped clean of the inky black that parasitized my soul. I was truly reborn, as this intensely wonderful trip was the great cleansing of everything that makes me me. 

After I started to come down, my body all of a sudden felt like it was full of air, like I had become a balloon man with a stick figure head. At this point, I was clear-headed enough that I wanted to get up and go to the bathroom and finally eat something. It was 2:48am at the time I stood up, and I was so shaky I couldn‚Äôt stand on my own. I went to go use the bathroom and got a good look at myself for the first time in the entire trip, and my eyes were so dilated, it was like being face to face with a great white shark. It was profound to see my face and eyes melting and contorting, but instead of scaring me, I thought that that was the sickest shit and I was mesmerized. 

From this point, we closed up shop in the living room and she went to bed with me because I still really needed someone to cling onto while my head was so scattered and shellshocked. But I woke up Saturday morning absolutely fine - no more hallucinations and that afterglow has stayed with me for more than 3 weeks now. Even though it was an intense and at-times terrifying trip, I would in no way call it a bad trip. It was absolutely lifechanging and spectacularly cathartic. I dont know when I might trip again, and but after this last one, I look forward to it with open arms.

2023-06-14 20:20:14,How do i keep my awareness centered and in the present moment?,"TL;DR: How i do keep my awareness centered and stay present

One thing ive realized through my years of lsd is that theres seemingly infinite answers to infinite questions but theres a question i have in me that i just cant word but the answer to it is ""this very moment"" the question isnt quite what the meaning of everything is. I guess its more akin to ""what the fuck? Like in general like what the fucks going on? Why the fuck? Like i want an answer, what the fuck is any of this"" and i guess that answer is less of a direct answer and more of a pointer as to say ""shhhhh, just look around you, thats what it is, that is what you're searching for"" but im having a hard time integrating this lesson, that i guess is, as ram dass would put it ""be here now"". How do i cultivate presence within the moment throughout each moment while living in the fast paced, complex system that we live in in the west. I actually enjoy the game that we play in the culture im in but it is really hard to maintain awareness of presence because i always loop back round to my anxious thoughts and fears. In the past year i think i gave up on self development and just let myself go with the wind bc i thought ""well there's no real answer besides what is so I'll just throw myself to the wind"" and in a way i wasn't exactly wrong in doing so but by doing so, the way in which i did it caused me to regress back into some old psychological habits because i wasn't keeping my awareness centered and present. I thought i didn't have to do that anymore because i thought i realized there was nothing to to do besides exist but i think what ive come to realize is there is actually something to do which is mainting that presence, and through that live a better life in this moment and truely be with the reality and not trapped in the feedback loop of my thoughts, as Alan Watts puts it ""a person who thinks all the time, has nothing to think about except thoughts""",62,1944,12,378,1

I'm completely new in the world of psychodelics. I've only tried weed but few months ago I really got interested in mushrooms. I read a ton of articles, watched dozens of videos, and bought a few books on the topic 'cause I don't wanna be reckless when it comes to taking any substances. the thing is I still got some questions because none of my friends did shroomies and I have no one to talk about it.

1. does the trip on a low dose or medium dose (let's say around 1g) feel any similar to a stoned feel? what are the differences? I just want to hear your descriptions!
2. do you recommend 0,5g or 1g for my first time?
3. is golden teacher a good one for the first trip?
4. when did you start taking higher doses?
5. in your opinion, what is the best way to consume them? I thought about making a dish like pasta and just add it to a sauce (I know not to cook them or boil them!) Is it a good idea or should I try something else?
6. I wanna grow my own shroomies but can I safely dry them in the oven?

This is something I‚Äôve wanted to address for a while now. This subreddit and people who have experienced the things we talk about here is truly amazing.

But there‚Äôs a lot of people who have life changing experiences through psychedelics and then lose touch of ‚Äúreality‚Äù and get so caught up trying to find more answers to life, that they forget to keep living. (Me being one of them)

I spent a long time searching my mind for answers and being unsatisfied with everyday life that I started to regret receiving all this knowledge because it seemed to just be eating away at me and I felt so empty.

Until I let go. Not letting go while in a trip. But letting go to the truth and answers that I was seeking so desperately for. I look at myself now, a small being on a tiny planet in an infinite universe and I think to myself ‚Äúdamn life is good. Me being alive and well is so much more than I could ever ask for.‚Äù And that really helps.

In this post, I talked about what consciousness really is based in very introspective observation, but people dismiss it entirely because ""It is not material"".

Nobody cares about my arguments, they Just see ""Wow, this idiot is saying consciousness isnt material, of course it is, I am too lazy to consider otherwise, therefore it is pseudoscientific and I Will downvote this moron"".

Most people there seen to be the same, colourless marxists, ideologues, atheists, determinists and materialists who know almost nothing from methaphysics, I agree with some of these positions, I Just hate How prevalent they are. They never have read Bergson, Whitehead, Deleuze, Nietzsche, Hegel or anyone who makes you rethink entirely (I havent too but at least I plan to do it).

Most people there have almost never read nothing of philosophy, they are completely amateurs, yet they are so sure of their beliefs.

That sub really seens like a hivemind, most people there think the same, there is much less discussion because there is no diversity of opinions, because they are fixed in one point of view.

I was banned and I actually think this might be better, I liked that sub because I could train my philosophy there, but it really seens that I keep reading the same comments and keep repeating myself.

There are two types of people in philosophy: philosophers and people who like philosophy, the latter seens to only like philosophy but most of them dont respect it, they dont respect it because they impoverish it.

Maybe my greatest mistake was to debate philosophy in a meme sub, but I cant see a better sub for it, and I need for someone 's opinion on it.

2023-06-14 18:08:54,Why we should legalise everything and not doing so is costing too many lives,"There are (I believe) two main reasons why people die from drugs all of which can be solved by legalisation:

# People don't know what they are getting

This one is everywhere, mainly concerning fentanyl; fent laced pills, fent laced coke, fent laced heroin etc, but you can see in a lot of other places, getting bromo-dragonfly or nbombe compunds instead of the lsd you wanted, getting meth in MDMA pills or research chemical substitutes with wildly differing potency and toxicity. Test kits exist ofc and are encouraged but the people who are more likely to buy from a sketchy source are much less likely to be able to afford a kit. These things cost money and people take the risk and use that money to buy more drugs instead of testing. Just because you give people the choice, doesn't mean they will take it. People don't bust out their test kits when getting molly at a rave, although the testing tents at festivals are great and should be around as long as drugs are illegal. On top of that test kits and fent strips are illegal in some places, which is ridiculous.

Legalisation will solve this issue in everyway. Official labs making pure products, Quality tests, health tests, etc. These things can be put into place to ensure you are getting EXACTLY what you want, no substitues, no filler, no impurites. Only this will be legal so you be buying meth made in Crazy Joe's garage or coke weighed on the fent scales your dealer never cleans. If you know what you are getting and you know how to use the substance safely deaths will be very small. And speaking of knowing how to use...

# People don't know the facts

I was told at school that people spike your drink with LSD and you if that happened you might have a good time with fun hallucinations but would most likely attempt to rip off your skin to get at the bugs crawling beneath it, the guy was a fucking police officer. This is obviously untrue is so many ways, so what else do they say is untrue? Before putting mind altering substances into your body, you ofc need to research the crap out of them but with so much mis-information and rehabs being promoted, it's hard to know what info is true and a lot of the info is based off analogies and isn't reliable. Bluelight is a great resource but google shadow banned it and if you don't know about bluelight, you won't by looking up drug info. I've seen too many stupid posts like people asking if 2g was enough to k-hole or should you do lines of fentanyl and these forums existing is obviously great but not everyone uses them, and not all the info you get is reliable simply because there aren't labs testing these substances to make psychonautwiki articles. You don't get taught how to clean out your nose after a sniffing session or how to inject properly, the former saving peoples nose, the latter saving lives. People don't know doseages, durations, toxicity, tolerance levels etc and all this information is very important. O-PCE is a ketamine analogue that some people use a substitute but while ket has a doseage of 30-150mg and low toxicity, O-PCE has a doseage of around 3-25mg and unkown toxicit reports. People have died even though they know what they were getting because they didn't have the information. A lot of people have died when they relapse on opiods, they go several months without use, then use the same amount as they were doing before. The lack of tolerance causes an overdose because the person wasn't aware of how long tolerance takes to go. This information is vital to drug users survival and should not be denied but instead taught. Say know to drugs is something I stole off a random redditor but it is a brilliant slogan.

Legalisation isn't enough to prevent as many deaths as you possible. We NEED information and I believe this should be done in two ways. Firstly research, we can't just rely on 50 year old animal tests and erowid reports we need actual testing, hard data. Will this take a while? Yes. Will it save lives? Absolutely. Until the tests are done, these drugs shouldn't be on the market, especially research chemicals although I imagine they would die down in popularity as who wants 1cp-AL-LAD when you could get LSD?

Second this information should be public and I think more than public. When buying a drug, it should some with an ""instruction booklet"" of sorts for that drug as well as general information. Let's say I buy ketamine. I should get it with information on daseage, tolerance, cross tolerance with other drug classes, duration, bladder damage, and routes of administration and how to safely perform each ROA and all other information that is relavant that I've most likely forgotten. This will save a lot of lives, especially of those who weren't aware of the dangers and/or don't know how to access the information.

&#x200B;

There are other reasons people die because of drugs of course, suicide, gang/cartel activities. I believe the suicide one is not one that will be affected by drug laws, they will happen regardless. Bleach isn't illegal, rope isn't illegal, train tracks aren't illegal. Drugs are just another way and that isn't a drug problem, it's a mental health problem, one that can be helped with drugs being allowed in therapy (ketamine, psylocibin, MDMA etc)

I'm can't say too much on the gang/cartel point as I'm not knowledgable in that field but drugs are a huge underground industry and this will limit the power and reach of these often violent orginisations. Drug deals gone wrong cause a lot of deaths of course and this is an aspect of drug deaths that will be negated entirely.

The final reason I will touch upon is research chemicals/synthetic cannabanoids. These are drugs specifically made to bypass existing substance laws and are untested and often dangerous. Sythetic cannabanoids are especially dangerous as people treat them as 'legal weed' and use like they would regular weed. You cannot overdose on weed but some sythetics are very toxic and you have no idea what you are getting and how much of it you are actually doing. Same goes with research chemicals, if you know hat they are and how to safely do them there's nothing wrong with them existing but most people don't and there's often also no info regarding them.

# Reasons against legalisation

There are of course arguments against this move, primarily rise in drug use and money hungry corperations getting hold of the market.

Many people argue drug use will go up when if this happens and this in itself is not a bad thing, so what more people are doing molly at raves, if they're following the three monthe rule (or whatever rule as determined by official studies) then it is fine, no-one is hurt and people have fun. The problem of course comes with the rise of addiction and I do not believe this is the case or at the very least the underlying problem. Peopl look at addicts and say that person has a drug problem but from listening to a lot of drug addict interveiws, a lot of them have deeper problems (mainly mental health, trauma etc) where one symptom is drug use and subsequent addiction. This is not the fault of the drug being avaliable, but due to a concious decision the user has made to escape their problems. I wonder how many people would have killed themselves if they hadn't found say heroin. They battled an addiction but they live and in a way the drug 'saved' their life, giving them time to reconsider and perhaps change, for the better. People are pressured into getting sober and kill themselves because they can't handle their problems. Drugs are not ""bad"" they are just molocules, it's about what you do with them are how you use them.

Drug use may not even rise due to legalisation, the classic example is prohibition increasing alchohol use but another one is ketamine use doubling in the uk after illegalisation. In the phillipines, dealers are shot, addicts resisting arrest are shot, even small possesions have mandatory prison sentences. This has caused thousands to be killed and people still get inprisoned and killed

Illegalisation doesn't stop use, it creates an unregulated market.

Drugs are so easy to get, you can go the sketchy part of town and ask a homeless man for his dealer or learn how to access and use darknet markets and get drugs delivered to your doorstep. New research chemicals are made all the time and can be legal for a time. Illegality doesn't reduce supply by much and regular supply may be helpful for addicts, especially addicts who want 'healthier alternatives' to the drugs they are using, think methadone clinics for heroin adiicts.

&#x200B;

Corperatisation is a problem but I believe it can be mitigated. Like tabacco, advertising should be illegal. Glorifying should be illegal, only facts should be presented. They shouldn't on shelves. You shouldn't be allowed to browse drugs with colourful, exciting packaging that draws you in. Companies shouldn't be trying to make as much money as they can but provinding a service. Instead you should have to ask for them, go to the counter and ask for a drug and amount. ""Could I have a gram of LSD?"" no you can go home and actually research the drug you're planning on taking. NO advertising, NO misinfo, nothing to encourage potential users/tryers of a drug.

&#x200B;

2023-06-14 15:52:12,Depression symptoms have worsened after my experience with changa,"TRIGGER WARNING: Mentioning depression & suicide
____

Hello, everyone!

Last week, I had the opportunity to attend an ayahuasca ceremony. The setting was wonderful, the people were lovely, and I generally felt safe.

 I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. As a precaution, I decided to stop taking my medication before the ceremony to avoid any potential complications. All safe. 

I have previously experimented with mushrooms and always had peaceful, spiritual experiences. I've also had spiritual experiences without the use of psychedelics, so I felt grounded and prepared for the ayahuasca ceremony. Or at least I thought I was. 

Unfortunately, the ayahuasca didn't have much effect on me. I experienced minimal visuals and effects, which was quite disappointing. However, before the ayahuasca ceremony, we smoked some changa, and that experience completely fucked me up. 

I had intense visuals and felt as though I was dying, even though I logically knew I wasn't. The sensation was indescribable in any human language. It felt as if 5D fractals were squeezing the life out of me, engulfing my lungs, nose, ears, and more. It's difficult to describe the sensation because I've never felt anything like it before.

I tried to let go, but my survival instincts were screaming that I didn't want this experience. I tried to relax, but realized I couldn't. Then, I  heard a voice inside my head. The medicine was talking to me. It was angry and told me I wasn't ready. 

Then I felt as though cold air was slapping me on my heart, stomach, and feet, and the medicine told me that these parts of my body were blocked. The visuals turned into something rotten (?) and eventually vanished. Technically, I was still under the influence, but I could no longer see or feel anything. 

Perhaps that explains why I didn't have a profound ayahuasca experience. I did have a brief encounter with a snake towards the end of the ceremony, but the effects were mild compared to my experiences with mushrooms. It was as if the medicine refused to cooperate with me.

Now, here comes the worst part.

I believe this changa experience has traumatized me. My depression has worsened, and the heaviness in my chest persists. It's physically challenging to carry on. The weight feels unbearable. Despite feeling well-prepared for the ceremony (even with my depression I felt great before ceremony and in a good place mentally) , I find myself in a worse state than before I started.

The only positive aspect is that, after this experience, I no longer have any desire to end my life. So I suppose that's a good thing. The thoughts of suicide have vanished.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm seeking by sharing this, but I simply needed to express myself and perhaps hear some thoughts, perspectives, or experiences from others. If anyone has gone through something similar, please share how you dealt with it. After this experience , I no longer want to explore my consciousness or engage in anything related to psychedelics. I feel traumatized for life. I'm a mess. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.",65,3120,9,524,1

2023-06-14 02:43:17,Bad Trip in Dream Meeting my Ego but I never did drugs,"(Sorry my English is Bad ) 
I, Girl, 23y had a Bad Trip in a dream and cant stop thinking about it.

1. Never in my Life have I ever consumed drugs besides alcohol. 
2. Yesterday I Went to sleep at 01am and woke up at 02 am in absolute panic and afraid: I was having a Nightmare the worst I ever had.

First it Started as normal, I was having fun at a Party in a cruise on the Sea, dancing Party with all my closest Friends. We drunk a lot and I got dizzy drunk I Started tripping and falling, had no Control over my body and movements I was dragging MYSELF by the divisions kitchen living room Till the bedroom the Last Place. I was holding onto my friends since I couldn't stand  alone, They were really worried about me, one of them said ""she is having a bad Trip!"" And the other said ""she drunk the cup and it had drug"" dont Know What Kind of drug it had. 
I even kissed one of them (Boy) in the mouth as if I had no air and was asking for help or Oxygen whatever, super weird. I Tried to call the 991 on the Phone and a Nice lady picked it but I Couldnt talk!

Then the paviment and walls started melting, the Cruise was bouncing, I was lying in the bed motionless and with an extremely heavy and tight body feeling. I wanted to move my body, my Arms and legs but I could not, I was stuck inside my body as if my Brain was disconnected from my muscles or as if I was dying and my body becoming a corpse.

Then at some point I realized I was Dreaming and Started screaming in the Dream in Order to wake up from the Dream. It did not Happen. I was aware that it was a Dream, I was feeling the Touch of the sheets in my bed and the blanket above me but I could not move a bit. 
Then I was swallowed by the ocean pulled by it against my will and there I was underwater in a Dark Blue water. 

this was the SCARIEST Part: a lady underwater appeared and was sitted, she was dressed all black also 100% motionless and her eyes were staring directly at me as if she was waiting for me to Go there as if I was a prey and we would be in confrontation. A thought came to my mind at that moment ""this Person is not any Person, this is you, you are Meeting Yourself but you are Split in 2 and those 2 people are Looking at each Other and the first one is scared. But the other Person was not identical to me, barely could See her Face tho but she was a stranger to me. The water was moving the Image was not clear and fixed. Dizziness. A Deep feeling of despair as if I was about to die or to be killed came along and the dread and fear was so intense that I woke up before the sitted person Said any word.

I woke up with pain in my body, muscular pain in hands, Arms, legs, feet, jaw and head. A specific Part of my head hurt: back head right (right from my Point of view) and my teeth also hurt.

3. I have Friends who have taken drugs more than once and they sometimes tell me about their Bad Trips. One of them told me 1year ago that he had a trip where he saw himself in the mirror and he was about to meet his ""Ego"" but Then the Image disappeared bc he said he was not prepared for that experience.

Q: Could my Dream be the Meeting with my Ego? Why is the Ego so feared by people who do drugs? I felt my brain was splitted in two or as if OTHER people lived inside my brain just like this lady. Or is it just the reproduction of the Stories my Friends who did drugs told me?
What Meanings could this have? Is it simple my Aversion to drugs + tiredness +imagination + my Friends influence? Or is it something only Psychoanalyse can tell?

I am worried that this might be the beginning of some mental issue like psycosis, panic or Schizophrenie idk since I never took drugs my brain just fabricantes a whole intense bad trip during Sleep at a normal weekday After work wtf",54,3770,12,759,1

They‚Äôre not listening to you .. They are listening to an idea of ""what you have to say"" based on what ""they""  told them to think. They believe it's ""their own idea"" but it has really just manifested in their awareness and is appearing more so out of inspiration or jealousy. It's not about you, you are small, worthless, and ultimately empty as your ""real self"" is an illusion.

2023-06-14 14:47:14,Ego Death / Ego Birth,"The topic of Ego Death is popular enough and has been discussed a lot by people in this community and outside it. But I‚Äôve been wondering whether it would be safe to assume there is also a concept of Ego Birth, is it just as fast for ego to come back as it is to disappear? I‚Äôm talking here both in the context of psychedelics as well as in general. The reason I felt compelled to ask this was because I was about to undergo something that would hopefully resemble and ego death (I‚Äôve had them before, both in the context of psychedelics and normal development), but was wondering where that ego came from in the first place. If it‚Äôs the reference point for my consciousness, what makes it so? Is it inherited like we inherit our bodies?

2023-06-14 14:02:00,"Comparative acute effects of mescaline,LSD, and psilocybin in a randomized, double-blind, placebo study. Results show equivalent dose strengths of 100ug LSD = 20mg psilocybin = 500mg mescaline.","Hello, I just wanted to share a new study on the effects and doses of LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, the first of this kind to give us an approximate dosage equivalent of these three classic psychedelics done in the same study. Here are graphs from the study, and a link is below for those interested in more details.

For anyone wondering how to convert this to actual mushrooms and mescaline cacti, it is hard to say as potency varies.

Most sources I have found state that average cubensis contains 8‚Äì10 mg of psilocybin per gram, so 2‚Äì2.5 grams would equal 100 ug of LSD.

Mescaline cacti have a wide range of mescaline content, from 0.2% in some San Pedro varieties to 5% in dark-stressed (bolivian torch) specimens and peyote. The average seems to be around 1% of dry matter in non-dark stressed plants, but it's a potentially wide range, and for harm reduction, it should be assumed material is in the higher end range for the first time ingestion so you can estimate potency. In highly potent dry material, that would mean 10 grams equal 100 ug of LSD, while in average, non-dark-stressed plants, it would be around 50 grams dry.

2023-06-14 12:02:27,First Trip of my life,"So in two days I would be taking the first shrooms trip of my life. 
For 3 years I have gone through hell. It was the darkest emotional crisis I have ever experienced. At one point I wanted someone to wipe out my existence. Not die. Just to not exist at all. 
I researched about Kundalini meditation and started trying to meditate on the root chakra. 
I'm ADHD and Autistic so my attention span is terrible and I'm constantly overwhelmed with sensory issues. 
Nothing changed per se but it feels like over a period of 6 months I'm starting to understand that the true fabric of reality. There's no ""I"" to suffer from you know. We are all a part of the fabric and without the ability to love the pain of existence is not just difficult but existence is not possible. Through love everything is connected all forms of animate and inanimate. Love allows the fabric of reality to remain as one collective. 
For the first time in my 30 years of existence I feel like I'm getting a coherent peek behind the curtain of reality. 
Yesterday I felt a pulse of energy flow from the base of my spine to the base of my throat. I don't know if this is Kundalini but I think it is. 

The only concern I have with shrooms is whether the new sensations will shift my focus from the ultimate realisation of the nature of reality.
I'm going to do the trip with my husband and my brothers. They are people I feel the most comfortable with.",21,1419,5,265,1

 Have also taken LSD once with 2 supposedly 150ug tabs A week ago, was pretty intense but handled it well with no problems. Planned on waiting a few weeks till taking acids again but the opportunity have arised to get my hands on some changa.

 I also think it will be a very long time until I have the opportunity to get anything except acid so this is a rare opportunity for me. Do my experienced trippers think that changa could be a good choice for me right now?

2023-06-14 04:42:06,21st birthday comedown soul bomb report (as recorded in the trip log),"\[Redacted\] and I have had the most beautiful trip. We each dropped half a tab and walked to the smoke shop for a scale. They had limited edition Snoop Dogg ones. We bought one took it home ground and measured and sprinkled a gram of shrooms each onto toast with Nutella followed by freezy pops like the ones they used to give out at field day in elementary. We watched a bit of ""loving Vincent"" and the moving brushstrokes took on a bit of cosmic significance

As young Vincent drawing in the bar, black and white and freshly sharp takes on a vital frantic urgency

Revealing a bit to me the death struggle that is artistry

We walk out unbothered down \[redacted\] St clutching dripping mango popsicles drenched in tajin

We cross back streets and I marvel at the way the earth and city alike open up before me

though the ""plants"" and ""weeds"" both, in their neighborly way, keep safe the peculiar little eccentricities of each of their homes' little families

We walked for an hour down the river and over the bridge, caressed by the wind and melting into the waves

The trees and the shaded ruins overrun with vines hold all the vibrant potential they did for me as a child

And it feels good to exchange meaningless affirmations of yes, how good it all is, how good it all feels

I am comforted to know in this moment the human problem is solved

That we are, in utter surrender and solidarity of experience, moving through today together

I hear a passing woman say, ""My body hates when I run,"" and think, what a silly thing to say, what a silly thing to think, when mind and body can be partners, and the self is not a thing to be fought with

We find a spot to settle and smoke and the earthly guidance of the shrooms begins to succumb to a dizzying acid-heady sense of earth and sky

Then I remember the futility of clinging to my earlier wonder or fleeing the overwhelm

It's true, desire is the cause of all suffering

I feel reassured in this and settle

Life like the trip cycle, so is happiness

\[scribbles\]

We went back to the park, the swings, where we started our trip, talking about how the last time we'd swung like this was at \[redacted\]'s funeral

And it all takes on the simplest and most beautiful significance, life and death and childhood and us then, again, as we were at the funeral and as we were at the start of the trip, back and forth like a pendulum, like the emotions, the balance, the trip, the yin and yang of it all, and the streetlight and trees and buckling concrete around us were all blessed with cosmic unity. I told \[redacted\] I understood--when Ram Dass gave that acid to the guru, and asked what he thought, and the man had felt nothing--I KNOW WHAT HE MEANT!",69,2711,12,499,1
2023-06-14 04:19:39,Trip Report: Shitting Wisdom at 0.3g (shrooms),"My ego is writing this while still feeling the effects of the psilocybin.  Silly ego.  He is motivated by ""likes.""  We will humor him.

Background: I've been taking a ""microdose"" of psilocybin mushrooms every third day for the last few weeks.  It's 0.2g, but I'm sensitive, so about half the time I take my dose, I can feel myself dipping just a little into psychedelic space.  Today a friend and I took a .1g dose just before lunch and I wanted some wisdom from the other side, so I took my normal .2g around 3:30pm, so a total of .3 grams.  

By 2pm, I had just the lightest feeling of that psychellic acceptance and calmness for the world as it is.  0.1g is probably a true microdose for me - a dose where I can do work in a peaceful, more focused state.  

3:00pm Drive home.  Everything feels pretty normal

3:30pm I take 0.2 g capsule of powdered cubensis

4:30pm I felt tired and took a nap with some uneasy dreams.  The dreams have vivid images and a doesn't-make-sense feeling that keeps waking me up.   

5:30 Family and I have dinner.  I did not feel very hungry due to a big lunch and slightly uneasy stomach.  By this time, I can definitely feel the mushrooms getting into my body - no visual effects, just a feeling of mental weight, wanting me to slow down.  Dinner goes normally - conversation is easy.  As I am cleaning up the dishes, I'm feeling a little woozy and like I need to lie down.

6:30 I go to my ""nap pod"".  This a largish box I have insulated to be dark and quiet.  It covers the top quarter of a single bed and is a great place to meditate in darkness and silence.   I settle in and let my mind relax.  After just a few minutes, I have the unmistakable feeling of moving over into psychedelic space.  The progression is the same as I have had on heavier doses (> 2.5 grams):  an introductory phase, a love phase, and a meeting god phase, where I have unquestionable realizations of the god-presence.  This presence is  vast, wise, loving, infinitely detailed and complex.   I get the fleeting impressions of a monstrous twisting snake with millions of colors and infinite writhing fractal detail.  This vision is similar to what I experience at heavier doses, however the color is muted and the details feel more remote.   

My ego is present in all this.  On a heroic trip he's off in a corner somewhere, but on such a light dose, he is constantly inserting his own thoughts and concerns, even trying to speak for the divine presence. The god in me is tolerant and patient, kind to my ego, and explains things like a parent to a child.  My ego wants guidance.  He wants certainty.  He wants judgement.   But the infinite being that is with me, that \_is\_ me, just relaxes, leans back a little, and gently parts the curtain that hides the next reality from this one.  There is so much love flowing through, I can hardly do anything but settle into it like a squishy warm bean bag.   This part of a psychedelic trip is especially delicious and the most difficult to explain.  When I can comprehend what is being shown to me at this point, my impulse is to laugh for joy.  Life, with all of its difficulties, is joyful.  In this heightened state, this truth is obvious to see.  In the every-day waking state, it is very difficult to see or even remember.  

""I give up"" I say,  ""I just want you to love me.   I will stop trying to run away, stop trying to run away from you.  I just want you to love me forever.""    This wakes up the divine feminine aspect of the divine being.  Her love and joy are obvious and encompassing.  She laughs so kindly at me.  

""What a silly thing to want, my child.   You are meant to run.  See your legs?  You are meant to run away from me as far and as fast as you can.""

""But i am afraid""

""You are afraid of running too far.  That isn't possible.  You cannot run to infinity.  Wherever you run to, I will always be right there and bring you back.""

I let this thought fill me and I submit to it.   In the meantime, the masculine aspect, the serpent-being I call ""Rafiki"", is enjoying the sensation of being in my body, even though my body isn't feeling all that great, because he approaches all sensations like a roller coaster.  I can feel my bowels moving into high gear and I get the urgent sense I have to change my venue to the bathroom right away.  

In the bathroom, I want to keep the visions going, so I lock the door and I keep the lights off while I sit on the porcelain throne.  There is a tiny night light next to me to keep me company, but otherwise quite dark.    As I sit there, I am going through the uncomfortable waves of a body trying to evacuate itself in a hurry.   Rafiki is delighted.  ""Isn't this amazing?""  I am tensing my muscles trying to move the process along, but he chides me, ""No no no, just let it.  You don't have to do anything.""   Sure enough, when I relax, the body takes over.  I can sense this the way Rafiki senses it, as a roller coaster.  It's a harsh sensation, but I can also perceive the joy of it.  As this is happening, I am also aware of the psychedelic landscape in my mind, and it is filled with a zillion three-dimensional bobble shapes that are constantly shifting and dividing.   I am at the apex of this trip.

As the shitting continues, Rafiki continues to enlighten me.  ""You think you are in control, but you are the observer here.  The body is doing everything.  Let the body do what it needs to do.""  It is hard to convey in writing, but I understand what he means.  The ego is a natural part of the body just as my intestines are.  And just as I can observe and enjoy the actions of the intestines, I can observe and enjoy the actions of the ego.  The god-self is intertwined, feeling the feelings, thinking the thoughts.   The suffering happens when the god-me tries to control what is going on.  

I relax into this new way of thinking and feel my inhibitions relaxing too.  In a low-inhibition state, I notice the primal yearning for sex.  I think about potential partners and could see sex happening with them.  This worries my ego.  He is terrified I might throw away my marriage in an affair.  Rafiki is there again to teach.  ""You think fucking is all about sex.  That is too simple.  Sex is only a \_symbol\_ for the fucking that gods do.   Fuck with the MIND child, not your dick.   When you fuck with the mind, you can joyfully and compassionately fuck anyone or anything and cause no harm to self or others.  Everyone wants to fuck this way.  Everyone wants to be fucked this way.""  

After receiving this wisdom, I get the sense that I have received what I wanted, the reason for taking this slightly higher dose.

7:30 My time in the bathroom concludes and my ego wants to write.  He knows there is a window of time where shame is distant and he can write authentically.  You are reading the result. 

9:15 Done writing.  Done Editing.  It felt good.  I feel at peace.  

  
Parting thoughts:

* Previous heroic doses prepared me to receive so much from this small dose
* It's important to have mental preparation for trips that speak like this.  Regular meditation and writing are my tools.
* It's also important to have quiet, dark places to surrender to the visions.   While on mushrooms, It's possible to engage with other people and do work, but without the quiet and the dark, I have found it hard to maintain the deeper connection.  
* Personally, I very much like what I receive in psychedelic visions, and they are also tiring.  I will be wrapping up my month-long microdosing experiment in a week and i am fine with that.  
* I will feel too scared to publish this tomorrow, so I better post now.",46,7645,7,1403,1

If one must be, is it better to be asleep or to be awake?

Is it better to live life in hiding, or in the spotlight?

It seems that we, as psychonauts, must choose. An ordinary life is not possible for any of us, anymore. I tried to go back to sleep. It was cheerful but bland. It felt like a false kind of safety, like the story still had rules, like my father on this Earth would still die in a few years.

Assume the world is truly all dreams, and hope, and language, and love, and user stories, and expectation and shareholder management, and design engineering, as I perceive it to be.

Couldn't we do better than fit in? Couldn't we start to make proper ripples, to grow our movement? Please notify me of any possible risks. I feel overwhelmingly as if our beloved departed Ancestors' voices are whispering courage to me every moment of every day. Our departed Ancestors are our moral compass, and they live on in our hearts.

Sometimes, they'll pull some tricks on reality. Not to worry, our Venerated Ancestors have access to non-causal technologies of storytelling that could figuratively blow a human's mind.

So as a Father‚Äôs Day gift to myself I have the morning to dive into some mushrooms and MDMA and listen to one of my all time favorite albums, which I‚Äôve never done to any music except for mushroom therapy style playlists.

I‚Äôll never forget the fall day of freshman year of high school that I cracked open the Lateralus album before school and head the grudge. I was floored, still gives me goosebumps thinking of it. I think it will be good to tap into that child self and let the journey evolve.

I‚Äôve hippie flipped before and done each separate. Most I‚Äôve taken in terms of MDMA as a 175lb male is 120mg and 2.5g of psilocybin. This was guided with a therapist. I‚Äôve done lower doses of the two in the past for a therapeutic walk, but that‚Äôs about it.

I was planning on getting up early, no breakfast and doing 120mg of MDMA and 1-2g of psilocybin. Probably eat the mushrooms 30 min before I take the MDMA then wait till I feel the come up to go under my eye mask.

2023-06-14 00:52:44,What makes someone a true psychonaut?,"I am a dabbler into almost all kinds of drugs. I dip my toes in, then pull out and walk away from it for months. Whether ""it"" is benzos, n2o, opioids (very occasionally), psychedelics, entactogens, or deliriants. Even cannabis, I sometimes take 6 month breaks from. I like to approach my use with a mindset of experimenting on myself and seeing what my mind is capable of. I am the type of person who takes mushrooms only to face my deepest traumas and smile back at them. I take opioids to modulate my anxiety and pain. I take benzos just to say ""fuck it"" very occasionally. Nitrous is a sweet treat to me.

What is the lower limit to being a psychonaut? Is it just the fact that you are exploring your mind with any substance, or is there a hierarchy of psychonaut subtypes based on the class and compound you enjoy the most?

Just been wondering this for a while. Would I classify as a psychonaut or a full-blown poly drug addict who thinks they are a mad scientist? I really don't know at this point but I feel like I truly just find drugs to be my favorite hobby. One that will stick with me to my last days, and I see nothing wrong with that as long as I function and improve myself on a daily basis.

2023-06-13 23:28:57,Want to take psilocybin but am on a high dose of SSRIs...is there hope for me?,"Hey guys I'm 35 and have been on 30 mg of Lexapro (an SSRI) for a while. I grew up in organized religion and had a massive faith crisis a little over a year ago which led to losing the entire foundation of my life. I lost my faith in God and lost the hope that I might be with my loved ones forever. 

As I slowly became atheist and started to reluctantly accept nihilism, I learned about psychedelics. As I continued to research psychedelics, the dead ember that had been inside of me started to ignite again. I felt so hopeful that I might find some peace in this life and heal through psychedelics. Even if that means never finding God or my once eternal family again, I'm ok with that. I just want to feel the oneness and love of the universe. I want to feel what Ram Dass, Alan Watts, and Terence McKenna experienced so deeply. 

And then I found out that SSRIs and psychedelics don't mix and I died inside. 

Is there any hope for me? Do I try and taper off of my meds or do I try psilocybin while on my meds? After all I've been through, I'm desperate to one day have a transcendent experience. I'd give anything just to feel universal love and peace just once. Thanks in advance for any hopeful words and/or advice. I also am fully aware that not all psychedelic journeys are peaches and cream. I know they can tell you hard truths and can be painful. I'm also ready and willing for that as well.",78,1404,16,268,1
2023-06-13 23:16:46,I had visions and delusions about pop culture references I'm not sure actually exist (4-aco-DMT 30mg trip),"So first of all, the 4-aco-DMT I took is at this point 10+ years old and from all my past experience I can safely say that this stuff doesn't degrade at all. I just keep it in a plastic bag in a box, nothing fancy like refrigeration. 

Anyways, so I did my usual setup: a playlist of albums at least 8 hours long on the stereo and a 10 hour ""beautiful drone footage"" youtube video (this one: https://youtu.be/ef1wAfrMg5I ) on the TV. Felt effects within 15 minutes of dropping, at 40 minutes I was blowing chunks, at an hour I was able to relax a bit more.

So I'm laying on the floor listening to this playlist (I just went to pitchfork and grabbed some highly rated albums from generes that felt fitting from the last five years, so this was my first time hearing all of it) and gazing at the imagery. I did this for about three hours.

During my trip, I had these vivid visions of pop culture references. They included:

* An illustration of a country girl on a pile of hay reaching for a guitar, meant to symbolize needing to write music as a form of escape or expression
* A live action brain and a foot tap tap tap tapping on the ground to the sound of a rapid heart beat until the anthropomorphized brain spoke and said ""Now what?""
* The MTV logo in marquee style bright lights with that astronaut character playing an electric guitar, except the astronaut was huge, standing on top of the globe, camera pulling back revealing the entire scene and the even bigger MTV logo behind him
* The drone footage in the video I was watching included some cityscapes, which all looked the same and I thought it was a reference to The Real Housewives (a show I've never watched)
* A grandma/grandpa face doing a little rocking side to side with their head as if to state an emotion along the lines of ""typical"" or ""what did you expect from (x)"" or ""there goes (x) again""

So when I was coming down, I wanted to look into these pop culture references to maybe piece together why I experienced them. First I checked the long drone footage video, since part of the visuals came from watching this footage. Scrubbing through the video in a more sober state, it appeared to be just a normal ass video.

Then I thought that it must be the music. One of the albums was the new Beach House record, and it didn't seem out of the ordinary they'd reference some old pop culture references that my synapsis were piecing together. Listened through all the music I consumed during the trip, nothing seemed like it would make me think of these visions.

Finally, today, I probed ChatGPT about these visions, describing them as best I could. It couldn't get any of them correct. YouTube search, Google search, same thing.

So yeah, idk, I've tripped a lot and have remembered strange pop culture references before, but they've always actually existed. This is the first time almost everything I remembered turned out to be a delusion. Unless any of y'all have any idea about the visions I described??",106,2980,17,544,1
2023-06-13 22:27:57,Ego death permanence,"Ego death permanence

After having ego death/partial ego death on shrooms and LSD a few times and it wearing off, it feels like it's catching up to me in real time. I feel like I am slowly dying as my desire to live disappears. What I fealt on LSD was that life itself is just desire, dissatisfaction, and the ignorance and delusion that their is anything to be find at all. That all function and existence itself is the delusional search for something that cannot be found and that we should just stop looking so that pain can end and we can be satisfied. In other words, we should die.
I get anxious over a lot of things and start questioning and invalidating why I do anything at all. Things around me have started to loose meaning and I don't enjoy them because they make me too anxious.
I am considering taking a mixing a large dose of San Pedro, LSA, and multiple strains of shrooms and I'm hoping the ego death could be complete and permanent so I can be at peace. I also have salvia, chacruna DMT, and B caapi micro dose capsules but I've never used them before.

2023-06-13 18:10:27,DMT-like experience before waking up,"Hi. I had an experience this morning that I am having a bit of a hard time coming to term with. It just doesn‚Äôt seem to fit well into any of my mental ‚Äúboxes‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been working for a while, now, to let myself be as aware as possible of my experience as I am falling asleep, and have also been working hard to recall my dreams or any imagery I had while I was sleeping, right when I wake up. This has led to me pretty regularly experiencing a state where I become aware before my body starts to ‚Äúgo online‚Äù. I will find myself just floating in blackness, and then I watch as I start to register different body senses coming online and I become aware of the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù world.

This experience I just described has been interesting. However, I‚Äôve had two experiences over the last week and a half that have been fascinating. For the first one, I realized I was getting LSD-like visuals as I was waking up, where they were more than 3-dimensional, if that makes sense.

However, today, I had an incredibly intense experience, again as I was waking up. It felt, surprisingly, almost exactly like a moderate dose of DMT. It was crystal clear, I was fully aware, and there was this feeling of it being more real than daily life. There were fractals all around, and there was a fractal face mixed in with them, similar, in some ways, to what I have seen while on exogenous DMT. There were beautiful hyperdimensional fractals all around, and the feeling of energy and the sound of it was incredibly intense - to the point of me getting slightly scared about the outcome. A voice spoke to me and said ‚Äúlet go‚Äù, and I felt it meant to just open up to the experience. I did my best to follow and let go and just experience it. It felt, also, like I was on the edge of something very profound.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? I‚Äôve been meditating pretty consistently for a while, and do sometimes get visuals while meditating, but this experience was much more clear and psychedelic than most of my experiences while meditating. Also, I haven‚Äôt taken any psychedelics in a while - I was completely sober. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.",36,2138,5,394,1

I considered posting this in a dream interpretation community but I think here is a more suitable place. 

So I had some of the most intense dreams I‚Äôve ever last night but one was particularly bizarre. I was in a place I can only describe as a DMT realm in which the world was full of the typical DMT colours with a light purple overtone with lots of multicoloured tunnels. There was a large floating and rotating purple dice which I was drawn to but I can‚Äôt remember what number was shown but there was between 3-5 dots on it but I can‚Äôt say for sure. It was also my birthday yesterday and a year to the day I took part in my first and only ayahuasca ceremony. I‚Äôm not sure if this is relevant but I thought it‚Äôs worth mentioning. The feeling and and visuals were exactly how a DMT breakthrough is. I‚Äôve recently been going through what I can only describe as a spiritual awakening. I‚Äôve recently also given up smoking cigarettes and cannabis which has been a long term problem over the last couple of years which has been effecting my life negatively in which I was in denial over.

2023-06-13 14:48:47,"The magic of magic mushrooms is not in the mushroom, it's within life itself.","All ""magic"" mushrooms do is show you the magic of your natural being. But there is a risk of mistaking the mushroom itself as the fundamental source of magic. Then you are liable to become weird and worship psilocybin like it were some savior. You use the mushroom as a crutch and might even talk to it like it's your imaginary friend.

Shrooms are just a plant-based tool that alter consciousness in such a manner that your extraordinary nature becomes obvious. Humans tend to interpret experience in a manner that kills the magic that is always present. Especially in a scientific society that defines matter as dead stuff. Really, your life is the magic. It's always there when you're sober. The natural world is the supernatural world. There is no real difference. But when it's so close to you, you tend to overlook it. So sometimes you need a mushroom to change your experience so radically that you get back in touch with who you really are.

So I feel that it is somewhat cringeworthy to ""respect"" magic mushrooms. It is not an alien. Sure, you want to use a powerful tool responsibly, but there is no need to idolize it like it were some celebrity. At the end of the day its just a bit of fungus in the forest. Every plant form in nature is an integral part of your being. When ingested, some of these plants alter the mind in interesting ways. But, if shrooms don't make your sober life magical, and you think you need shrooms to experience the magic, you've really missed the most important thing they can show you about yourself.",77,1541,14,277,1

Over the weekend I went out with some people in celebration of my 20th. Turned into a bit of an ecstasy fuelled rampage.

2023-06-13 10:54:51,"""Heroic dose of DMT"" - I meet God (First time)","Yesterday, I embarked on an unusual journey with a dosage way beyond the recommendation. This was my first time (I tried a small dose the day before). With a high threshold for intoxication, I took 35-40 puffs. To prolong the brief 5-minute trips, I continually repeated the process. The whole trip took approx. 1-1.5hr.

This is my first time doing it, and I probably smoked it wrong, had the wrong voltage, and maybe even got bad stuff. But anyway.

The journey was introspective, to say the least. My consciousness remained largely unaffected; I was still present but in a dialogue with my own mind. This dialogue was internal - I was not speaking to some higher power but to myself. It was a strange sensation that led to the realization that all the power I sought was already within me and always has been. I wasn't created but had always been here, constantly transforming. Interestingly, I was also under the influence of little marijuana.

Originally, I had planned to spend the trip painting. However, my plans were set aside as I delved deeper into introspection. The experience was profound but almost indescribable - something that I've called 'The Chair Moment.'

Some entities told me (without saying anything) to relax and take in the smoke deeper that they would guide me through this experience, and they carried a feeling that everything was safe.

During this moment, I found myself grappling with my own existence. There was an overwhelming feeling of melancholy, to the point where existence seemed unbearable. But then, I experienced a change in perspective. It was as if my very molecules were communicating with me, teaching me that they only change form and do not cease to exist.

I was introduced to the concept that I could command these molecules, control my body temperature and mental state, and choose my path toward healing. I could see my molecules working, yearning for my command, and they didn't fear command as I do.

Amidst all this, I felt the comforting presence of my spiritual parent, the all-father, God. In only 4 words, his advice echoed in my mind. Our father's words resonated with me: ""**Be nice to yourself.**"" I was also comforted by a motherly presence that felt nurturing.

I confronted my fear of death in an unexpectedly pleasant manner. I witnessed a 3D, orange version of myself (difficult to explain) leave my body and have the ability to choose my next destination. It was a realization that even after death, I have the choice of where to go. This felt like an affirmation of life after death. It revealed that life is unconditional, I am my own judge, and I can always choose my perception. This felt like true free will.

**Life after death**

* You choose where to go next. ( A little fight, but you choose)
* You will never be judged for anything. Life is unconditional.
* You are the only judge of yourself.
* That is free will.
* I can always choose how I perceive; thus, I have full control and genuine free will.

This hit me with an extreme feeling of ownership of myself and my own actions. This is a philosophy I've been holding myself to my entire life, with no proof, but it hit me this time.

With this newfound realization, I began to reevaluate my priorities. I decided to focus more on myself rather than going out of my way to assist others. I resolved to live my life as my own hero, performing heroic acts for myself.

By the end of this profound journey, I had never felt more connected to my true self. It was a trip of intense introspection, free of distractions and deeply rooted in the present moment. It was like viewing reality for what it truly is, making decisions and choices. It led me to wonder if this is the state we reach when we sleep and why it's so important to take care of it and get enough good quality sleep.

Overall, this journey was an emotional rollercoaster that led to a profound revelation of myself. I am still processing all that transpired, but the trip has given me a deeper understanding of my existence and place in the universe.

Have any of you had similar experiences? How did it affect you?

I still deeply crave to return there and desperately want to get my hand on some more. I feel that I need more, but I am not sure if it's my own insecurities, addictive personality, or what, and I have this fear that I might disintegrate as a person if I do it too much.

2023-06-13 05:04:40,The possible link between UFOs and DMT/psychedelic entities,"Mentioning UFOs may seem out of place on a sub dedicated to psychedelics, but hear me out on some thoughts regarding similarities between both.

Firstly, both have similarities in their history. Both were spoken about widely in the media and by the government with full disclosure to the public during the 40s and 50s. During this time there were many UFO sightings talked about in the news. And in the case of psychedelics there was open research and attention on the substances, especially LSD, and it too was talked about openly in the media.

Come the 60s and the government changes stances on both phenomena. UFO sightings begin to be covered up with excuses like weather balloons and natural phenomena. The US government hired a scientist to basically say that UFOs aren't worth investigating anymore, whilst legitimate claims have come out that the US government indeed kept on studying UFOs in secrecy. 

In regard to psychedelics, this is where the war on drugs began, misinformation campaigns started, and the government turned psychedelics into something to be feared. They took away scientific funding and made it illegal to even research psychedelics for medical purposes. 

Fast forward to the last decade. After decades of stigmatization, both UFOs and psychedelics have entered mainstream media and have made major laws change around them. Congress allowed the formation of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to study UFOs and their origins, as well as the Pentagon releasing confirmed UFO videos captured by the Navy and Air Force. 

Psychedelics as most of you would know, have been able to be studied again scientifically, and more recently have been decriminalized and legalized in some US states. There is less stigma towards psychedelics and we are seeing more pro psychedelic TV shows and other forms of media appearing. 

That's the history discussed, now let me just pose a thought to you all.

Recently, a whistleblower, former intelligent officer, David Grush, who worked on the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force expressed to Congress that he was made known to the fact their was a secret group inside the US government who had recovered alien spacecraft and had a lot more evidence than just the 3 videos released by the Pentagon. He has made many claims and testified in front of Congress. 

Some of the claims he is making include that the US government has covered up numerous UFO sightings and crashes, that they purposely spread a misinformation campaign, that they've worked on reverse engineering UFO technology and that these UFOs are most likely interdimensional, rather than extraterrestrial. 

Numerous former government officials, ex air force, marine and navy officers have all come out to back up his claims and have provided their own testimonies of experiences regarding UFOs.

These sound far fetched, and should be met with a healthy amount of skepticism. However, let me just bring up the case of entities people see during psychedelic trips, especially DMT. 

I believe 100% that people come into contact with intelligent entities from other dimensions whilst on these substances. I have experienced it myself. I'm sure you've all read and heard many stories regarding contact with DMT entities, as well as maybe having your own personal experience. Whether you think these experiences happen purely in the subconscious, or in another tangible dimension, these experiences do happen to people. I'm inclined to believe the latter. 

Now, if a human being can smoke a substance that allows them to temporarily enter another plane of existence and communicate with a non human intelligence, who's to say an entity somewhere else can't also do the same thing? And if they're more advanced, they may know how to do this over a larger time scale and move willingly to and from. 

These are all just fun thoughts regarding this. I've recently gone down the UFO rabbit hole and couldn't help but think of these similarities to psychedelics and make me feel like there's something related here. 

For those interested in UFOs, check out r/UFOs or just Google David Grush, there's an interview with him on news channels and it's making a stir in the media.

Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences regarding this! There's so much we don't know and I don't claim to know much at all, but talking about these ideas is what makes us all think deeply about life and everything :)",59,4438,8,730,1

I did a lot of Ketamine three days ago (mixed it with alcohol and weed) and am feeling super horrible after it since I went into a K-hole and felt super disassociated.

The first day after I did Ketamine, I felt bad like my chest was a little achy, and had thoughts of existence, like am I really alive, and still feel a bit detached from current reality.

Also, been having constant negative thoughts, and heavy anxiety where I think my heart feels bad, but in reality it is normal. 

I went to the emergency room as well since I thought I was having a heart attack, but I wasn't. But I cant stop thinking of my heart.

Will I get normal again? I want to feel and be normal again. I hate feeling like this.

I did so by implementing  mostly religious motivation and also a bit by delving into my psyche through meditation and lucid dreaming. Throughout my process of abstaining from any sexual activity and adult content in an attempt to rewire by my brain, I always see flashes of these scenes in my head, particularly of one specific individual. When this happens I've tried to confront, forgive, and let go go. I also try ignoring these images when they flash in my mind. Neither strategy has proved to be highly effective as to this day I still see flashes of these scenes at such random times for example I sat down on the toilet today and boom I see vivid and moving dirty images in my head. I'm personally concerned about why I'm still seeing these images in my mind so vividly and would love if you guys had advice on how to stop or lessen frequency of this.

Results show changes in the serotonin system based on menstrual cycle phase, posing interesting questions for psychedelic researchers:

1. Does timing of dose make a difference for the female population?
2. Can ovarian hormones interact with psychedelics? If so, how?

To date there are no studies I can find on menstrual cycles and psychedelics - so citizen science it is :)  Any ideas, suggestions, theories, or philosophical rants on the topic?

2023-06-12 19:49:12,I had my first psychedelic trip when I was 8 years old. This is what happened.,"Between the ages of 6 and 10, I lived in West Africa with my missionary parents. Inevitably, I caught malaria, and experienced a series of highly intense psychedelic experiences. Aside from being extremely terrifying to my young mind, these experiences resulted in my having vision-blocking flashbacks for around twenty years that meant I was medically disqualified from driving. Only in the past few weeks (around five years since the flashbacks stopped) have I begun to explore the psychedelic space once more, this time voluntarily using psilocybin. To some extent, this feels like reclaiming the experience as something I'm doing, instead of some that was done to me by the malaria-carrying mosquito.

Having now done more than one heroic dose, I equate my malaria experience to something above this level, perhaps 6-7g dried golden teacher. During my malarial hallucinations, I seemed to be occupying what I have since come to realise as hyperbolic space - infinite geometries, spatial paradoxes and the like. Alien bodies infinitely large and infinitely small at the same time, being attached to a rolling ball that was so large that it did not move at all as it moved. Impossible to make sense of rationally. There was also an extremely distressing sequence where I watched two people inside an enclosed space lined with spikes that was getting smaller, and those people were taking it in turns to give up or to try to rouse the other into action. It went on for days, subjectively at least. I was sick for around two weeks, but when I came out of it I believed that I had lived an entirely different life in Hell. Amazingly enough, I told nobody, and spent the next ten years or so processing these experiences alone. 

I am healed now and wiser for it. I am so excited to continue my psychedelic journey. What felt like deranged and unjust punishment now feels like a wonderful adventure. I am not afraid of this stuff any more.",78,1937,16,331,1

2023-06-12 17:33:46,Tripped with my partner and he had a bad experience,"Me (25F) and my partner (29M) tripped on an eighth of shrooms this past week. This was like my 5th doing shrooms and I‚Äôve always done the same amount. My partner said he‚Äôd done them before and I asked if he was in a good head space multiple times before taking them.

Long story short, he had a very bad time. It‚Äôs almost as if he immediately tried to throw them up and out loud said he was ‚Äúfighting some demons‚Äù in what sounded to be a scary voice üò≠ he was growling (or what I perceived as growling) during some of his time.

He stayed in my bathroom for the greater part of the trip and was seemingly having a very bad mental break down. I was surprised how calm I was through that and how I even was able to focus on him and make sure we were  both alright, but it was pretty scary now that I really think back to it. He basically was stuck in a pretty bad loop and was acting severely psychotic. For two hours, he basically sat and battled himself in my bathroom naked üò≠

It was pretty traumatic and I had called one of my closest friends to cry about it that evening and me and him haven‚Äôt revisited/talked about that night since.

After the fact, he told me he had only really micro-dosed and claimed to have done small amounts of shrooms but..idk. I honestly feel bad for even giving him any. His behavior overall on them were pretty scary tbh.

Edit: grammar

Follow up: I know there‚Äôs a lot of discussion and mostly good input. I condensed the story obviously but I wanted to reiterate that I do care for my partner and multiple times throughout the thread stated I just felt bad he had a hard time, not to make this about me. It was a shared experience overall and I think it‚Äôs valid to feel a way toward it a little, especially since it was completely unexpected. I did not inflame his tough time, I supported him through the journey. The call I made to my friend was after the trip was done, while he was sleeping and I moved myself outside and took a walk. When my partner woke up from a nap after the trip, I made sure I was up to chat to him briefly on what he felt comfortable discussing with me in the moment and told him not to feel embarrassed about the entire thing. It happens. It was just a scary situation because we were BOTH tripping and I was under the pretense that he had taken that much before.",51,2324,10,449,1
2023-06-12 17:12:58,First high dose DMT experience: it felt like an ancient being/god/entity had gain control over me.,"Of everything i could have tought, from the +500 experience report i have read/heard prior to my experience. I dont remember of anyone reporting something like this. I am shocked, i dont know what to think. 

I was definitely ¬´¬†letting go¬†¬ª at some point. There was no time nor ¬´¬†me¬†¬ª anymore. I was close to something very profound. But then out of nowhere i began to fight. From this point i started moving my body(my real body in the real world), spitting and making strange noise. My eyes were opening and closing but there was no difference in my mind. Note that i still dont feel myself and time at this moment. As i write those lines, it makes me think of an exorcist. Like im getting rid of demon or purging. 

Im now in fethal position, in a defense mecanism style. Im overwhelm and i start feeling something really disturbing and strange. Something or someone is increasingly getting in control over my mind and my body. Then all of a sudden i get up on one knee with one hand on the floor. From there, i swear im feeling a strong and ancient powerful presence sharing my body and seeing trough my eyes, ready to stand up and walk. 

Finally, my kids‚Ä¶ my wife, i start remembering who i am. The presence is gone. Im still tripping balls and feel tired. I let myself fall on the ground and wait till the visuals end. I feel cold and im shaking a bit, mindblown by what i‚Äôve experienced. Nothing would have prepared me to this. I am experienced in psychedelics but this was way beyond any other trip.

I'm posting here because  when I searched what I'm feeling, this sub came up a bunch of times. 

---

I'm in my mid 30s and I've had this for as long as I can remember. I have bouts of overwhelming emotion that usually last anywhere from a couple hours to several days, and that generally focus on being profoundly affected by the suffering of other living beings (people, animals, including insects/spiders/arthropods, plant life, fungi, etc.)

I know this isn't physically possible but it's like in that moment I can 'feel' their collective suffering and it's overwhelming and makes me break down in tears as well as several emotions I don't believe have names, at least not in English they don't.

It's like there's a web of all life that for a brief moment I'm connected to, and seeing it from the perspective of the 'whole' instead of the 'one' is overwhelming in a way I can't properly express, and even when the moment is over it sticks with me for a couple of days. I don't know if this makes any sense, but it feels like how I would imagine an ant seeing the world from the perspective of a human, and then going back to being an ant. Like for a couple of minutes I can see the whole picture, and it's terrifying.

This happens every once in a while, but it was a lot more prevalent when I was around 9-14 years old. I don't want the feeling to go away, but I'm curious as to what causes it, if anyone else has it, if it's associated with a known illness, you get the idea.",103,1681,18,317,1

2023-06-12 11:08:12,I'm curious about the common self-regulations..,"I've recently gotten into Reddit..like within the last two months I think.. and the only other social media I've ever had has been MySpace and Facebook.. 
(I know, I know, let me live)
..having then stumbled into the somehow familiar psychedelic corners of Reddits infinite abyss.

I've been tripping for over a decade now, and have guided many people through their first experiences, and some, subsequently, many more. 

People will listen to me speak passionately about my experiences, and about how psychedelics have changed my life, and that overzealous passion even costing me past employments, potential platonic and romantic relationships, and inevitably some parts of my own immediate blood relation..

..but those people who I have come across that are so intrigued by them that they decide to take that leap with me, they become my family, and I have built quite a large psychedelic family over the years.

I started with weed, then LSD, RC's, shrooms, and finally DMT (the end-all, be-all üôèüôá), in that order.

I've used them all countless times now. 
Both heroically for spiritual purposes, ""praying at the alter of nonsense"" as I've heard it referred, as well as in strict moderation, occasionally microdosing in daily regimens for medicinal purposes.

*inhales sharply because I'd forgotten to breath*

-My intense line of questioning starts here-

Maybe I'm being partially stupid and/or totally naive here, and have completely overlooked the very simple explanation for my inquiry but..

Why are there so many psychedelic subs with the common self-regulation of ""No Sourcing""?

I mean, I can understand the spam and the scams..?

I have encountered enough of them on Facebook, but most (if not all) of the subs that I have seen so far have expressly forbidden even asking for advice about the legitamacy of some of the sources that one might come across exploring social media under the threat of perma-ban.

Even the subs claiming to be promoting ""safe usage""..

How does it make sense that someone without a sages experience in acquiring these substances has to stumble through the dark in attempting to find a safe and legitimate source online if they don't have the opportunity to source them locally?

As a community, shouldn't we want to help these people not only in their use, but the procurement of the substances in question? 
Understanding how poweful and life-altering they can be? Or how dangerous and destructive they can also be? 

(I've personally known someone charged with manslaughter after their friend died at their friends own birthday party having taken something they were told was powder L but was in fact an RC, sourced locally, and have heard of many other instances where problems like that have arisen while taking drugs from unreliable sources, at places like music festivals)

Anyone who has had any level of experience with them can say with near certainty the kind of beneficial impact they could have on our species if procured and dosed safely, even if they aren't certain how it could happen, or what exactly would happen as a result of everyone using them.. 

So what barrier is it that we're running into? 

We all agree that these substances should be legalized, and REVERED.. 

How else would they become legalized if WE, the people who are MOST experienced with them, don't do something to make them more accessible? 

To make their presence more known, understood and recognizable as something not to be feared, but to be welcomed?

Is it the legalities? The fear of incarceration? 
Is it Reddit's policies? Is it out of fear that shared reliable sources may become dead-ends when shared too frequently or with the wrong people? Is it out of fear that the sub will spiral out of control if the spam/scams can't be moderated?

Maybe it's a little of everything we could name that keeps us from communicating, even if simply to keep others from getting scammed into purchasing from unreliable sources..we all understand how meaningless and also important money is..

What can't I put my finger on it?

Reddit users have helped me to understand a LOT since I've started using it. It's like having ChatGPT, but rather it's a collection of real people that specialize in a little of everything and sometimes nothing at all.

I look forward to hearing what you all may think.",47,4326,6,721,1

2023-06-12 09:05:15,Took DPH for the first time,"Took DPH for the first time. 

I took 275mg last night to fall asleep. I woke up feeling drunk and needed to pee. When I got up was when I realize I took to much since everything felt so weird. The best I can describe it is that it feels as if my soul is trying to drift away from my body (later made me come to the conclusion that the body is a prison of the soul).


Anyways, took a piss then went back to bed. Sleep was weird and short. I'd close my eyes and have vivid dreams then wake up again realizing I was breathing too shallow so had to will myself to breath right. Anyways, the dreams felt like episodes, the ones I can rememeber were:

1. I was a phone on a stand being used by a student to record herself taking a test.


2. That we are all trapped in a boxed up reality, stacked together like breaks to form a wall made by a furry red giant.


3.  I saw a guy I know (and hate) with vivid detail as if his face was imprinted into my brain. (I immediately snapped out of that dream cause I chose not to believe what that dream was telling me).


4. Came to the realization that time is not linear for some reason. Can't remember what dream it was. But I woke up with that conclusion.


5. Our lives are already written. We have no free will. Whatever I do or say in order to avoid this conclusion is futile if thay conclusion is already written by God. In essence, there is no free will.


I guess my whole take away from tripping on a low dose of DPH is that this world is a prison for souls, that each body is a weight for the soul in order to prevent it from living this prison and joining where its supposed to be. I also believe Earth is nothing but a holding cell, that whatever we do here with our lives is useless (wether we do good or bad) because we leave all of what we do here on Earth once our soul is finally free. 

Anyways, I just flushed out the remaining DPH I had down the toilet. Im never touching that shit again.",27,1947,6,389,1

2023-06-12 08:17:46,What is the weirdest/most unique revelation you have had while tripping?,"Last time I tripped on Acid (360ug), I became infatuated with confidence and proficiency as a man.

All day, I could not stop watching videos of guys who I perceived as ""confident"" or ""competent"" in a certain craft, whether that be boxing, running, hunting, making business deals, warfighting, etc.

This kind of thinking made me obsessed with becoming like them, becoming more assertive, confident and competent in life. When I wasn't watching videos, I was doing push-ups, hitting my punching bag, brainstorming business ideas and more.

Overall, the experience made me much more aware of my own incompetence and it made me more focused to a certain degree.

2023-06-12 07:25:49,Trip report - 5 grams of PE shrooms,"So guys last Saturday i took 5 grams of dried PE shrooms with a couple of friends. This was my only my second time eating shrooms - the first time it was 2 grams. I know that the sudden jump from 2 to 5 is probably not the best idea but i went for it anyway. The first time I've experienced some mild visuals and a huge wave of euphoria and i had a very pleasant time. This time however it was so different so much ... more. I still can't really find words to express what I've felt but I'll try. The first effects came about 20 mins in - i've spotted some very mild waviness of the wooden floorboards then some euphoria (though not as intense as the first time). Then the visuals became more and more extreme, any small movement kind of... continue (?) swirled and spiraled into circlelike shapes, most object started changing colors rapidly and started to shrink then expand. I felt my body very heavy and i found it difficult to move also a faint feeling of sinking began to creep. At certain points i've found out that i've stopped breathing, just for a second i'm sure but that's something that i remember clearly. Also from time to time i remember that my leg muscles were super tense. I remember that whenever i wanted to say something i've always ended up not saying anything and thinking that it would be pointless anyway. On the other hand my friend next to me talked pretty much constantly. Everything that he was saying didn't make any sense to me at the moment (and of course he was on shrooms as well so it's very possible that indeed it made no sense). I've tried to follow the flow of his thoughts but they've always ended nowhere, however, i found his voice very pleasant and kind of soothing. At the peak of the trip, the visuals became very intense and i felt like reality itself was unraveling before my eyes and i had the strange feeling that my mind was fragmented and was simultaneously in more than one place (i don't really know how to explain this it felt like my mind was a physical object that was at several locations at the same time). At this point, I've started to wonder if this will be my life from now on and i felt that I'll be ok with it. After that I've started to come down rather slowly my mind started to merge itself again and the visual effects slowly disappeared though I felt a bit outside of the situation for maybe an hour or two. In the end, I was left pretty confused with the deep feeling that something profound has happened to me yet i had no idea what it was or how to make sense of it.

&#x200B;

Now whenever I've slept since then i have very vivid dreams. I've also found out that some of the music that i like makes me super emotional and brings me to tears sometimes. I am at a point of my life where I find it increasingly difficult to be moved by... well... anything and I rarely find something that excites me so that new development makes me very happy.

2023-06-12 04:12:56,Potential temporary psychosis of 3g of magic mushrooms and some cannabis,"To preface this I am not an entirely experienced psychonaut, my 3 acid trips I had done previously gave little visuals and was more of a bonding moment with my friends then any breakthroughs and the 1g of mushrooms I did 2 weeks ago didn't give any notable effects so I was not experienced with what happened. I'm not posting the full story now but some background is I am in a fairly shit position in life rn and during the trip I almost died/passed out (it was a whole can of worms by itself) due to what can only be guessed as heatstroke or something.   
I suppose that everything could be chalked upto ego death but no matter what my friends did I could not ground myself.

So essentially I was dancing with friends about 4 hours into the trip, we were camping on a beach and my friend had accidentally packed me a 3rd cone instead of for himself, I smoked that and I began blacking out. Everything felt like it was repeating, I felt like I was dead, I couldn't think of anything besides the beach and I thought everything ceased to exist. I believed everything I thought I could manifest with this resulting in me trying to walk through a car, I jumped in a fire and stood in it for a minute without any worry. I felt as if I was god but I was forced to repeat everything all over again, my friends were all saying stuff that reinforced my beliefs (which they didn't actually say but my brain just thought) I believed I was the sand and the ants and everything in existence, that everything was the same. Some of my friends came back with beer and I believed I had summoned it out of existence with just thought alone and everything just felt ethereal. It felt like no matter what I did I couldn't get out of the loop that I was trapped in, I experienced growing up and dying multiple times, it's as if everything kept repeating and I found myself doing exactly what I had watched others do and I was just fulfilling a grand prophecy that resulted in everything going and being revealed as a god who makes whatever I want. I felt me and my friends were all gods who had the ability to do whatever we wanted.   


I ended up coming back to reality after everything worn off but it was a gradual ease to see if everything was real, initially I still was weary about if I was in the right dimension or not but I regained pretty much all my senses, but the reason I say psychosis is that it felt like someone flipped a switch, I remember exactly when I lost control and exactly when I regained control and every other part of the trip I can remember vividly but during the ego death/psychosis my memory falls to pieces and it's more like remembering that I did the action but not what actually was going on. I know that I did all that but I cannot actually remember what I was physically doing nor what my friends were doing during all of it.",72,2843,11,539,1

2023-06-12 00:30:04,What matters?,"Hello. TLDR below.

I‚Äôve had my first two trips this weekend. I wouldn‚Äôt say I feel born again, but my compass of priorities shifted once I looked at things in perspective. You will read the word ‚Äúmatter‚Äù a lot. This might be a bit  long. 

Some background. I live in the Netherlands. This weekend I‚Äôve had two trips on truffles. Never tried psychedelics before. I have been previously diagnosed with ADHD. I have tried different meds and none seemed to have an effect. I could never get into meditation as it seemed impossibly hard and boring. I‚Äôve been doing therapy weekly for the last 3 years. This weekend was.. eye opening. 

Trip 1

First trip was in a group in nature on a smaller dose. After the initial peak and contemplating the clouds for their weird shapes and the leaves abd trees for their fractals, I was able to just sit and admire nature for what it is. I have almost never been able too. I would need a book, a podcast, something, anything. But I was just there. Looking at a tree and enjoying the calmness with some themes by Jon Hopkins playing in the background. I gained a lot of appreciation for nature during this trip. I asked myself many things, like why I don‚Äôt just invite people on picnics? Why can‚Äôt I just go to a park and enjoy it? I always have the opportunity to. But instead I‚Äôm at home playing some games that while sometimes are enjoyable, in many cases are a way to kill time. 

I‚Äôm generally a junk food addict. I do value good cuisine, but there‚Äôs just something in junk food that gives me ‚Äúthe‚Äù dopamine hit. It‚Äôs also usually one of the easily accessible things on delivery apps. Suffice to say, I‚Äôm overweight. BMI over 36. 

Anyway, during the trip I realized how much more I enjoy the greeneries and vegetables. We had some store bought sandwiches, berries and watermelon. The sandwiches were left untouched. It‚Äôs just didn‚Äôt feel right. The bacon, the crappy toaster bread, the shitty mayo.. all became so unappealing.  While the berries and watermelon hit just the spot. 

Overall, the trip was nice for a first experience. Light, with not too much introspection as I was in a group and one of my friends just tried to ridicule things. It was all fun, but a different experience.

Trip 2 

Today I took them myself. Also went for double of what I took yesterday. I took them at home. And again, during the peak I just sat on the balcony contemplating nature and thinking about things. I have no plants at home. Why? Because it takes effort. I‚Äôm lazy and forgetful. But plants matter. I should buy a small tree for the balcony and some indoor plant. 

I followed this idea further. What matters? 

Quite usually I fall into this flow where my apartment is quite the trash. I don‚Äôt clean off the tables. I don‚Äôt wash the dishes. Sometimes I have an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù because I need to go somewhere and I have no underwear. Now, you might think I look like a hobo. No. I clean shave. I iron my clothes. My wash my clothes. I use deodorant and perfume. Why? Because how people perceive me matters. My father doesn‚Äôt use deodorant and I hate being closed to him at the end of a long day. Why do I use deodorant? Because it removes the aggressive smell of sweat to both me and the surrounding people. Not being a smelly nuisance to other people matters.

Why do I not clean my apartment?  Well. I do. Quite thoroughly actually. But only when I expect guests. Why? Because the people I invite matter to me and I want them to have a good experience and not sit in a dump. But why then do i let it get to such a shitty situation? Because it doesn‚Äôt matter to me. While I would prefer not living in a dirty apartment, the effort to do it is too much. It does not matter enough. But being able to invite people on a whim does. It matters. I cleaned my apartment after the trip. 

I looked at my own body. I‚Äôm soon 30. I‚Äôm fat. I barely see myself during the day in mirrors and get to reflect how I look. I have my mirror in a walk in closet (it‚Äôs a studio apartment, not really by choice). I decided to take it out and put it outside in the main area and took a good look at myself. I‚Äôm keeping the mirror outside, because I need to look at this vessel of mine more often. Because I need to take care of it. Because it matters. 

Why did I get so fat? Why did I not pay attention to my diet? Because food mattered. The dopamine hit mattered. It still likely does, but my body matters more. I pinged my personal trainer. He had a slot tomorrow. I‚Äôm going. Because my body matters. 

During the trip I also remembered about my grandma. We lived together. She brought me up. She used to take care of her garden. I hated that thing. So much effort. Hooking up the bloody hose every second day in the summer. It was pretty though. It mattered to her. And now it also suddenly matters to me. 

Now she‚Äôs old and can barely walk. I‚Äôm 3000 kms away from her and I cannot make it to where she is because of the current political situation. I‚Äôm going to start planning something to see her. Because she matters. 

 I also thought about other people in my life. Specially the ones I‚Äôm closer with. They matter. I want to do something for them. I want to be closer with them. I usually try to not impose myself on people because I think they have their own lives and I‚Äôm an annoyance. But‚Ä¶ they matter. So I want to be more with them. Invite them to outings, or even just a simple dinner where we cook together. These things matter. 

I hope these ideas and change in perspective sticks to me for some time. I don‚Äôt feel like taking truffles again. For now I came to enough conclusions. 

In the end, it was all about asking the right question. What matters to me? And what matters to you, fellow redditor?

Thanks for the read. 

TLDR: tried shrooms for first time. Had a very drastic shift in my way of thinking. Mainly, asking myself what matters in my life. Now on the road to changing habits. Hoping it sticks.",13,5934,2,1108,1

Half tab my first time cause I'm small and my friend wasn't sure how it would hit me. That was fun but not too wild. Yesterday I had my first real actual trip from a single tab which the more experienced people I was with said was pretty strong after they took theirs. I understand it can get way way deeper but a couple times for what felt like a few seconds it got very hard to differentiate my body from the outside and I forgot my name and I was told afterward that's the start of ego death. It happened while I was walking too, like my body was still moving on autopilot somehow but I felt like a ghost as if it had melted away. I wasn't afraid of that feeling itself but I did have a tiny momentary spike of anxiety from ""oh something's happening and I dont know how to tell anyone what's going on or how long I'm going to be in this spot"".

2023-06-11 20:22:13,The Mystery of Consciousness,"https://youtu.be/reYdQYZ9Rj4

""The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you."" 

- Werner Heisenberg (The father of quantum physics)

I feel wary posting this here, but as someone who is searching for the truth, I feel it is important to gain as much perspective as possible. And psychedelics play a huge role in understanding this mystery, so maybe this is the place to ask. I'd like you all to take a look at this video and try to give it a chance. I know it's long, but definitely worth it. I believe the implications of this theory are very promising in establishing a much-needed reframe for the way in which we investigate through the lens of science. 

I believe that most don't realize that both Religion/Spirituality and Science are hopelessly lost without each other. Non-Physical Phenomena and Physical Phenomena are connected in a very special way that is not yet explainable through conventional means. Therefore, science and religion are forever doomed to never establish a complete TOE (Theory of Everything). 

The mystery of Consciousness is where we should start, but it's too ""mystical"" and ""woo-ish"" for most conventional authorities (on both sides) to investigate seriously. And that's why I fear we'll never figure out the answer. Because human beings have a massive flaw: the inability to think beyond the status quo (unless forced or otherwise influenced in some meaningful way). It threatens a sense of homeostasis, which our mind and body fight tooth and nail to build and maintain.

What is your belief regarding the mystery of consciousness and why?",28,1666,4,277,1

My idea would be that it would drown out all differences, religion, race, politics, greed, selfishness, fear, etc among the human race and a new society would be born out of love, compassion, and a total dedication towards becoming a civilization that truly cares about each other and the path that we‚Äôre all heading towards.

2023-06-11 19:15:44,The benefits controlled substance use can have on your life,"I have been somewhat of a psychonaut for a few years now, I started off smoking weed and I enjoyed it because it was another state of consciousness. Things appeared more funny,music sounded amazing and food tasted 10X better, the standard side effects of weed that everyone loves.


I then read ‚ÄòHow to change your mind‚Äô by Mike Polson, a book about plant medicine, which dives deep into the use and benefits of psychedelics, out of curiosity, I then delved into the world of psyches as I felt I had to experience this for myself. I felt I was mentally strong enough to experience this state without having a bad trip.

Me and my friends would go camping, and I would use LSD as an alternative to alcohol , this resulted in me having sore ribs when showering the next day, due to the amount that I was laughing the night before, laughter therapy, I called it as that‚Äôs what it felt like. 
 
However, it wasn‚Äôt just the giggles or the visuals that acid induced that I enjoyed. I started to see things in my life in a different light, the problems that I had and things I obsessed over, I started to put them into perspective and I was able to see that my worrying was pointless as no amount of worrying changes the outcome if many things we face.

I also worked through trauma in my life and felt I was able to heal from things that happened in my childhood that I hadn‚Äôt noticed were still with me. 

I then started microdosing every now and again, again out of curiosity I wanted to see if I would become more productive or creative or just see an improvement in my mind state in general, all of which happened. 

Psychedelics are substances that when taken with consciousness and used correctly in terms of dosage and setting in order harness the benefits they bring from a medicinal standpoint instead of just to ‚Äòget high‚Äô can have an incredibly positive effect on your life. 

Since my experience with LSD and mushrooms began, many areas of my life improved. I became a lot closer with my mother and was able to forgive her for things in the past, I earned a scholarship to play football and study in the US and have since moved from Scotland to the US to do Exactly that. 

Any challenges I‚Äôve faced on the way I have been able to overcome and I don‚Äôt believe that this was all the work of the psychedelics. Of course I have my own confidence and direction in life, but I do 100% believe they helped me to go for it and put in to perspective the notion that we only get one time around this world and that l should do everything that I can, while I‚Äôm alive to make it the best it could possibly be for myself.

Psychedelics have the power to remind you how lucky we are to experience this life, and for that, I will always be grateful of my choice to become a Psychonaut :)

2023-06-11 16:57:41,I Had an Eye Opening Experience,"Dose:
4.5g Shrooms
2g Weed

Ok so before the main event I have to get some background info out of the way as I believe it‚Äôs relevant to my trip experience.

So, before this trip I was in a depressed and angry mood because of some issues me and my girl are working through and overall just felt lost. This was my first time moving out on my own and I had just failed my college program due to my severe weed and nicotine addiction and being broke asf. So overall not in a good place and I have never been in what I consider a good place.

I decided I wanted to watch a good ol nature documentary narrated by mr Attenborough. During the documentary I could not stop my brain from seeing this constant pattern of life, which I knew before but it just kinda clicked in my head. My brain was also trying to find some animal that lived what I would consider a peaceful life, no threats, challenges etc. just good ol chillin and happiness. But, I came to realize that the life I am looking for doesn‚Äôt exist and it‚Äôs actually impossible for me to achieve what I have always been subconsciously striving for.

This has really opened my eyes and made me realize that in order for me to be happy I have to face suffering and come out on the other side in order to have a meaningful and happy life.

The downside of this however is that now I am really lost and don‚Äôt know where to start rebuilding my brain and my purpose. I have started with quitting weed but I am going to do a 5g trip tonight with the goal of trying to find a purpose or something along those lines because my last trip feels like I only unlocked one half of what I need to know.",31,1639,6,319,1

2023-06-11 14:03:58,First trip on PE (2G) ~ wow,"I bought 5g of Penis Envy some time ago and saved it for a moment when I felt I should use it, finally the day came when me and two friends got together to be tripping at night. Knowing that the potency of PE should not be underestimated i decided to start with 2g.

30 min in, it started to hit, i felt much more physical effects than in other strains, like I was always being touched in the back and neck, not in a bad way, just different, as for the visuals they were also much stronger, felt like 5+, of all the times i trip i never had closed eyes visuals, more like mental visualizations of complex geometrical forms, but this time it was different, at the peak of the effect I closed my eyes and started to trip in the emptiness of my eyelid like I was entering a black hole, same with my cat, looking close at his fur felt like I was zooming into an empty void. Listening to The Dark Side of the Moon felt amazing too, mindblowing to say the least.

The downfall of the effect is my favorite part, it seems that expressing our feelings becomes extremely easy, we had of lot of deep conversations, talking about our past and present, our problems and how we could improve, advising each other (everyone should do this, really) After about 10 hours I still felt the effects slightly and that's very crazy lmao, it was an incredible experience and I would definitely do it again, the only negative part i'd say is the extreme difficulty to eat literally in these strong trips, I don't know how to explain it but it's like being hungry but without the desire to eat, yeah it's weird but anyway that's it for my trip report!",27,1627,7,307,1

This literally gave me FREEDOM. 

It's a huge word. I didn't even knew I was all tied up by my negative patterns. I didn't knew how much I hated myself and how I was vicariously hurting myself through others. I've allowed people to treat me like trash because I felt like trash.

My trips showed me that I'm enough, that I'm worth it, that im not hard to love at all. That I overcompensate for the love I was never given as a child. Allowing narcissistic people to feed on my patience and forgiveness because I wish someone would have done that for me in the past. That I asume everyone is good at heart while I try to meet the imaginary expectations I believe the rest hold of me. 

That I'm the most important person in my life. That loving one self sometimes means to go through a period of pain, loneliness and confusion for a greater good. 

I'm not saying I'm a victim, I'm directly responsible for most of what happens in my life but it's been really liberating to be able to see things for what they are, to see so clearly how my trauma affects my personality, decisions and relationships. To be given the chance to make different decisions, to choose how I want to live.

Mushrooms however... probably taken 6 or 7 times and I've consistently experienced crippling anxiety that is very out of character for me. I go into completely into my shell, and can't communicate or vibe with anyone. 

I feel alienated, separate from others, awkward, and like I've taken a step back in my mental health.

No ultimate lesson either, just feelings of depression and anxiety that do not feel like me. Ive asked myself, is there a lesson? Is this my shadow? Maybe... But whats the point of the worst version of myself coming to the surface? What am I suppose to do with it? 

It's not like I ignore or suppress it out of fear and avoidance, i just feel like it's a part of everyone, and it grows or shrinks depending on how much energy we give it. I've explored it many many times and it just feels like an excuse for self pity and there's nothing really for me there. I cry, then feel shit and like a victim, then that's it, I continue to feel shit.

2023-06-10 21:46:57,Umm.. should I go out while on shrooms?,"Hi. I've been very depressed lately. I don't know you, but I relate to you and appreciate you for reading.

 I took shrooms today, just some that I grew, 2g. I struggle a lot with social anxiety you see, and am quite lonely lately. But someone has invited me out. Basically I can go outside and interact with people who I don't fully know. And that may seem normal but that's like my main issue in life, is not being able to talk and be me with people.

My question is should I go now? Now that I'm feeling like I actually could for once? Or should I let these shrooms do their thing alone?

Does anyone have any advice? A similar soul that may have struggled with loneliness. Do you think it's a good idea?

Any help or thoughts or just a hello is sincerely appreciated.

Update:
After having decided to stay in and feeling terribly lonely for a while (like sobbing in the pain of loneliness and literally on the phone waiting for Samaritans to pick up), this being as the shrooms were wearing off as well, the someones who had invited me out came back to get some food, and shouted. I thought they were in danger or needed help, but they were just drunk. And they asked me to join them out, and even convinced me to come. I'm so grateful to them. Though it feels a bit like divine intervention almost with how well timed their arrival was. I wouldn't have gone out if it wasn't for them. I had resigned myself to crying and wishing I could sleep instantly. I'm going to go bed now. Thanks to all who replied and took the time to read. Mush love to you all, truly üíñ",39,1566,8,299,1

2023-06-10 20:43:48,I went through a very terrifying 3 weeklong psychosis/ego death/idk what from amanita muscaria and am looking for a guide or anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar,"Title. I went through insane experiences and even ended up in the hospital for a few days, and idk what to even make of what all I experienced. 

Some points I was God. Some points God was sending me messages. Some points I was convinced I was connected to this other person that I barely know in a profound spiritual way, we had a bunch of clear synchronicities and I needed them to understand it before time ran out. A bunch of prophecies and stories I was convinced I was a part of.


I‚Äôm fully out of it now, but I know I‚Äôm never really going to be the same. I‚Äôm normal again, but can‚Äôt forget the experiences. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that during this time, strange things actually DID happen to me that people around me saw and even now will admit to and they can‚Äôt explain. For example, a song randomly out of nowhere popped up playing on my phone that was called ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll meet‚Äù. The lyrics were like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre so beautiful, we will meet one day‚Äù etc..Tried googling to no end later and cannot find any evidence of the song existing. I have 15+ other weird things that happened like this during the three weeks.


Maybe it was just psychosis but I can‚Äôt understand or fully move on from what happened to me in the sense of integrating it as some sensical thing. Anyone manage to have an experience like this and move on sanely with their lives?",168,1366,27,254,1

2023-06-10 19:38:38,Dreamt taking DMT,"I‚Äôve never smoked DMT, but it‚Äôs a possibility I‚Äôve been considering for about a year now. I find it fascinating to ponder the nature of what ‚Äúreality‚Äù truly is, and how our perception (and the limits thereof) shape what we believe to be real. I‚Äôm *somewhat* experienced with psychedelics, having taken LSD a handful of times (never more than a single tab, though), but nothing else.

Last night, I hit up an old plug of mine from my hometown (since nobody in my town seems to have any DMT), and he had it! So in my mind, this put actually taking the damn stuff into the realm of real possibility; I could probably pick some up next time I visited family! I ended up reading trip reports pretty late until I fell asleep around 3:30am, and reality and dream began to blend together:

I‚Äôve driven back to my hometown, and I‚Äôve ostensibly arrived at my plug‚Äôs apartment (which I‚Äôve never seen or been to). I enter the apartment, and an aura of friendship and camaraderie is palpable. I haven‚Äôt/don‚Äôt communicate with this guy outside of picking up drugs, so I would have expected to feel like a fish out of water at a stranger‚Äôs home, but instead it was as if I was where I belonged. He then showed me various 510 cartridges with clear liquid, as well as a jar of freebase DMT. He showed me his personal cartridge, which was extremely low (basically an e-roach, lol), but it was still something. When I realized I had no money in my pocket, he generously offered me the remains of his cartridge. The feeling when he gave it to me was a feeling of completeness; the attainment of something seemingly unattainable. My plug gave off an energy of pure friendship and calmness, which helped my anxiety around taking flight. Not wanting to impose, though, I thanked him profusely , and I went home to hit my nearly-depleted cartridge.

I laid down in my home at my parents‚Äô house, took just one large hit, and immediately I was soaring through a tunnel of electric, pulsing light. It was like being sucked through a wormhole of all quantum possibilities; a condensation of all reality is, was, and could be. I had an intense body load that made me feel as if I was riding on the fastest rollercoaster I would ever ride. I was quite scared at my loss of control of the situation, but an internal voice essentially told me that everything was okay, and that I could let go. When I did let go, I entered a sort of white space of nothingness. I calmed myself down by taking long, deep breaths, and eventually, the blinding white void faded back into my regular vision. I was still on the bed, heart pounding, but ultimately feeling transformed.

That‚Äôs the last I remember before waking up around noon. It felt so real yet *unreal*; there was absolutely the feeling of being outside oneself that I‚Äôve come accustomed to in my LSD trips, only magnified. When I woke up, though, I was back in base reality, ego intact. I had an intense, gripping desire to go back to the DMT world, but was disappointed when I realized I didn‚Äôt actually have any. Usually, I‚Äôm glad to wake up and realize my dreams weren‚Äôt real, however, this was certainly an exception.

I talked to my plug this morning, and he‚Äôs offering freebase for $100/g, which seems to be a fair price. After this dream experience, I would love to take him up on that offer, but I feel that I may be in over my head. It‚Äôs been over a year since I‚Äôve done LSD, so I‚Äôm considering taking 2 tabs at least once and then psilocybin for the first time at some point to better prepare myself for DMT. If DMT is a fraction of what I experienced in my dream, I think I‚Äôve got *a lot* of preparation to do.

If anyone else has had a dream experience taking a psychedelic (and perhaps one you hadn‚Äôt taken in base reality already), I‚Äôd love to hear your experience! It‚Äôs fascinating what our minds can show us, and how fragile our reality is; there‚Äôs no telling what is actually out there, as we‚Äôre limited by our balance of neurotransmitters, other chemicals, and the limited/inadequate ‚Äútechnology‚Äù of our own senses.

2023-06-10 18:58:03,Blackouts on LSD,"So like a month ago I took 3 LSD laced gummies, first time with liquid. My plug showed me a lab test afterwards and it was LSD hut he said it was close to 150ug per gummy.

2023-06-10 17:55:22,How Long Do Your Shroom Trips Last?,So just a couple weeks ago me and my friend tried some shroom edibles and had a great time. I took mine at 8pm and started to get high around 9pm and I was fully sober by 12am. I was quite upset that it was so short when everything I‚Äôve read says trips can last up to 8 hours. I tried them a second time 2 weeks later and took twice as much (4.5g). The high was stronger but felt even shorter than the first trip and this one only lasted around 2 hours. Both times I smoked weed as well so I don‚Äôt know if that made it shorter. I want to know how long your trips last and if there is a way I can make them last longer.,35,618,7,131,1
2023-06-10 17:50:22,I think my edible may have been laced last night,"I am someone who has experience with edibles but to say that yesterday was my worst experience on edibles is an understatement. My boyfriend had recently purchased a 2 84mg peach ring from a questionable source. A few days back he had taken one of the rings and had a great time nothing crazy, so I decided to take his second ring last night. Boy was that a mistake 

As soon as it hit I had to immediately sit down, I felt weak and dizzy. We decided to try to watch chainsaw man but to my dismay we were on the episode with the infinity demon and everything went downhill from there. My brain was on overload and felt as if was bursting every few minutes, my chest was aching like crazy and finally, the uncontrollable shaking began. No matter how many blankets I wrapped around my self I was cold and shaking badly. Then everything kept blinking in and out, if I tried to stand and walk it off I felt incredibly dizzy and heavy. I tried to close my eyes and just breathe but that wasn‚Äôt helping. At some point my dog and cat started chasing each other up and down the stairs‚Äî I live in an upstairs apartment so there is only the front door downstairs‚Äî this where I start hallucinating and I mean full on acid esq open eye hallucination that my dog was at the bottom of the stairs mauling my cat to piece. Full panic sets in, I jump off my couch, over the banister, slam into the wall and turn on the stairwell light to my utter shock as my fear has come true: blood everywhere, pieces of my cat all over the ground. Or so I thought. It took me a minute for this horrid image to blink out of existence and for my eyes to adjust to the reality that my cat was just fine and they were just hanging out down there. It was the worst thing I have ever witnessed or experienced, it felt so real that I had to sit there on the top of the steps just breathing and trying to rationalize what had just happened. 

At this point I decided I needed to go to bed but it was impossible to sleep, my mind wouldn‚Äôt stop playing vivid memories of times before when I had been high. Reality fell apart, I was bombarded with images of what souls actually look like according to my mind. The souls were these odd neon lines forming different shapes with a translucent mesh bag over it. So strange. My mind wouldn‚Äôt stop to the point that I no longer knew what a human was supposed to look like. Every memory that came into my mind was tainted by this realization, for example: if I saw myself talking to someone all I saw were these lines forming weird triangles and moving and readjusting as I spoke to other similar squiggly souls. All of this disturbed me to the point of feeling that life was meaninglessly confusing. 

All this lasted till about 9 this morning and even know I feel sick and not myself so please excuse the typos. I‚Äôm curious to know if anyone has experienced something like this before whether it be edibles or not.

Update: Thank you everyone for your responses! After a long much needed nap I realized my mind was thinking the worst case scenario for everything, full panic mode lol. Still not 100% but definitely better. I‚Äôve never had this happen with any substance even a bad acid moment wasn‚Äôt as bad as this so I‚Äôll probably be avoiding edibles from now on.",48,3267,10,617,1
2023-06-10 17:47:49,"For those who have realized god exists, do you have trouble now existing among atheists?","Respectfully, this is a post for those who believe in god, if you don't believe in god, please respectfully don't reply. 


To me god represents ""The Good"", a faith in life and acknowledgement of the beauty of existence. Physics, science, our consciousness and intelligence as humans, are all expressions of god. When I believe in god, I feel positive and happy, my self esteem is higher, and my nihilism goes away. I don't believe in religion because I don't believe anyone can tell someone else what god thinks, and that anyone who does is trying to manipulate you. 


I feel very at odds with most people. Most liberal people, at lease on reddit, and where I live, are atheists, and they don't understand that people can believe in god without believing in religion. To them god is synonymous with religion, the manipulation that goes with it, and the bigoted narrow-minded beliefs associated with it. So to reject god is to reject that stuff. I understand that, but that isn't what god means to me. To me, acknowledging god is being in awe of existence, of life, happy and grateful to exist, in awe of the beautiful, mysterious, complex system we live in, and the possibilities. To me having faith in god is the same as having faith in life. 


With atheism being the prevailing belief system among liberal people like me, I find myself starting to believe in it, and then starting to descend into nihilism. It's hard to hold onto a belief that's at odds with what everyone else thinks. When I tell myself god doesn't exist, it feels like a rejection of hope and of life, and the idea that things can go well. I start feeling hopeless, negative, and not in control of my own life, which I understand is the opposite of how atheists feel, they feel more in control of their lives when they tell themselves god isn't real. 


So my question is, how do those here who now believe in god because of their psychedelic use, exist in an atheist world? When everyone assumes that your belief comes from religion and don't understand what you mean, and when people don't respect your views? When I remember I believe in god, I feel hopeful again, but because everyone around me is atheist I very soon forget, because I‚Äôm constantly bombarded with the idea that god isn't real, and I just can‚Äôt seem to hold onto my realization that god is real because I'm constantly told otherwise. Please, again, I would like only replies from others who believe in god and I would ask atheists to please refrain from responding.",88,2509,15,444,1

My life has gotten emotionally difficult, moreso than in the past, and I‚Äôm at a loss for actions I can take to help remedy my suffering (I already exercise, eat well, meditate, etc.) and oftentimes my painful feelings keep me ‚Äústuck‚Äù in not forming new friendships, relationships, etc.

I have multiple mushrooms experiences under my belt, my most recent experience being 3 weeks ago, all macrodoses. They provide me immense relief and groundedness with myself. Because of something, perhaps a desire to be less safe and more wild, true to myself, I feel a calling to do them more often but do not want to get burned or lose the magic. Generally, I‚Äôve done them 2x a year but recently it‚Äôs been closer 3x in the last 365 days and it seems I want it more. 

I think before I do another macro dose, I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions and also am considering trying a micro dosing regime first. With this being said, will microdosing permanently ruin the magic of a macro dose in my future? Trips feel like necessary resets to my life.

After I researched a lot of it (the works of graham Hancock and Brian muraresku etc) and since I have an understanding my visuals have become clear sacred geometry, and like, tracers around living creatures like spiders, birds, anything like an energy field grid of neon colours. The most insane, is on 750ug a couple weeks ago my visuals morphed into a biblically accurate angel before I knew what it was and told me not to be afraid and was like a tentacle type thing with eyes wriggling out of my tv and I tried to explain it to my friends but quickly gave up, a few days ago my friend posted a photo of one on his story and I freaked out and was like wtf that‚Äôs that thing I seen and he told me what it was and I was genuinely mindblown. It was such a spiritual trip too. 6 months ago I was entirely atheist. Now I‚Äôm the complete opposite.

Excerpt- ""The findings of scientists in the West strongly support, in many cases without meaning to, one of the most fundamental insights of the East: that the individual self is more akin to a fictional character than a real thing. 

Why does all of this matter? The unfortunate truth is that each of us will experience plenty of mental pain, misery, and frustration in our lifetimes. Mistaking the voice in our head for a thing and labeling it ‚Äúme‚Äù brings us into conflict with the neuropsychological evidence that shows there is no such thing.

2023-06-10 14:35:56,Anyone finding it harder to believe that after death we go to a place of non-experience?,"For the longest time I have had this notion that after we die / when we are dead, our experiences stop entirely and we just no longer exist or experience anything.

&nbsp;

Obviously, when I try to imagine this, I come up empty handed because ‚Äúnothingness‚Äù literally cannot be imagined. There is no color or sound or sensation associated with nothing. So it wouldn‚Äôt just be this dark, empty, silent place, because ‚Äúnothing‚Äù has no qualities at all.

&nbsp;

I am not saying i believe in an afterlife now, but to me it makes more sense that we would be come everything rather than nothing.

&nbsp;

I have even gone on to wonder if lifeless matter itself has an experience of it‚Äôs own, just an experience very dissimilar to ours. And maybe life forms are just very filtered experiences that have evolved for their own sake and purposes.


&nbsp;


Obviously this is all non-scientific speculation, but it can be fun to think about without taking myself too seriously. But the other thing i was thinking about is how strange that if we die and we do become nothing, then from our point of view, time, space, and the universe no longer exists. Which is like saying we leave this reality where all that can exist does, and go to another reality where nothing exists at all, again, from our perspective. How weird is os that?


&nbsp;


Final ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thought. What if lifeless matter only has intuition and only knows what it is supposed to do, making it predictable in a mathematical sense. Meanwhile people/life have more than intuition, we have knowledge. Like our brains store experiences and our DNA stores genetic information, but we have more awareness and more knowledge than just our intuition so we often feel like we have don‚Äôt know what we are doing / supposed to be doing, making our behavior much more difficult to predict or understand.

2023-06-10 12:23:24,Trip Report: 1st time LSD (155ug) for intermediate experienced dude,"Friends, it blew my mind yesterday - surprise of my life. 

I've had dozen+ trips on shrooms up to 5g of PE, 1x mescaline trip, 1x MDMA, 1x sub-breakthrough DMT (vape), and 1x 5-meo (high dose)... plus a fair bit of high dose cannabis edible experiences... so I did NOT expect to be taken on a ride. 

LSD at 155ug was probably the most profound trip I've had. Intellectually I know it's not a high dose, but it was somehow deeper than the 5g mushroom trip. (Also 5-meo was obviously more powerful but The Void is just so different, it's almost not psychedelic). 

LSD had elements of all the other psyches combined - the heart and emotion of mesci on the come-up, the profoundness/connection of shrooms at the peak, and while I wouldn't say it felt exactly like the whisper of the DMT space I felt on my last experience, during the peak I sensed I was floating around in a place that seemed like it could become kind of similar to that cartoonish / hindu 'place' I felt. Then there was the introspection (and amphetamine vibe, more on that later) from MDMA. 

LSD is a classic for a reason, and possibly ""my favourite"" now but with a few caveats (length and the amphetamine-esque edginess).

Here's there blow-by-blow:

10:30am: Prep - I made 2 nests in the house, one main floor one bedroom in case (blankets, water, etc at both). I walked the house before taking the tab, shaking a tambourine and blessing the rooms. This was my first time doing this and I really liked it. Got my nervous energy out. Highly recommend. 

10:45: Dropping - tab under the tongue with the goal of holding for 15 minutes. No bitterness or bad flavour. I tuned my acoustic guitar and started playing, which is the first time I've done that on a come-up and it's HIGHLY recommended vs. meditating or something that puts the focus on your body vs. distracting you. It was also AMAZING not to have the shroom nausea that I realize now has coloured a lot of my other experiences - I kind of dread it and spend time waiting for it and fighting it etc. 

11:00 - 12:00pm: Come-up - swallowed the tab, starting to feel something as I played guitar. I just noodle around with my own creations in different tunings. I noticed I wanted to sing, so I started singing and was getting more and more emotional, thinking bout my childhood, my wife, etc. Before I knew it, I was weeping and really connecting with my inner child (who had been neglected in many ways). I also started writing messages to myself at this time, which are really heavy and profound, glad I did that. I realized the fear that my parents had and how they passed that fear down to me. This part was SUPER similar to the come-up on mescaline for me, minus the mesci nausea which is intense for me, but I felt my heart just opening. Eventually had to lie down to go deeper. 

12:00 - 1:30 (?): Peak - I sensed that I was being called to move deeper than the emotional state of dealing with trauma, and really connected with Motherhood - my mom, and my wife with our kids - and was in awe of cosmic love as shown through a mother's love, and marvelling at the depth of my love for our kids. This began also to feel too specific to me as a being and that I was called into deeper \*something\*, so I began to let go and focus more on the spiritual. I was awash in colours and landscapes, not that I saw them but I felt them or imagined them. I did lose contact with my body at times. I also let go of the concept of self. I felt ""the spirit"" that was kind of guiding me saying ""See, this is the way -- not forcing the understanding but letting go into the space behind understanding"" so I kept trying that, and succeeded here and there. But came back to myself a fair bit too. I think a higher dose would let me detach completely. 

I also explored what I am. I tried to 'get behind' what I am, what's the root? I flirted with the idea that I am God but that didn't quite seem right (sorry - I know that's a popular vibe here). I also explored Christian ideas since that's my faith background and my default experience of the numinous. It felt OK in that space - things like union with God through Christ, that we are beings in God's image, and that me, as a created Being that is destined for union with God (or a return to union with God). I am beyond precious and unique and worthy of love and power etc. I also had this sense that Christianity really does NOT give God any kind of true kudos for being The Ageless Eternal One. It's just so mired in the temporal stuff like sin, death, etc. And yet here, in this space, it felt like I was communing with The Ageless One who was both Ancient in a terrifying way but also The Young One since all moments are the Eternal Now. That part reminded my of mescaline too. It was really interesting. I also felt a presence throughout this period of a feminine kind of vibe - a bit more lighthearted and loving - which is often my experience via shrooms. 

This Peak was I think the deepest I've been, and the most psychedelic space I've been to. It was wonderful. It felt like a miracle -- and made ME feel like a miracle --  I was in contact with love and Being and one-ness and God. Losing contact with myself in this space of love and light and imagination and God was just amazing. 

So that was the first 1/3rd of the trip, and frankly, I kind of wish it had ended there. I think at this point it's like 2pm. I start coming out the peak because, I realized, I wasn't feeling right in my intestines. I hadn't eaten much that day so I went to eat some grapes and crackers, but that didn't really help. 

Now begins the hard part. The feeling of discomfort grew in my lower GI tract, and I felt the tight-jaw amphetamine style chemical energy in my body. I was also exhausted already - so many tears, so much learning, so much experience... but I wasn't done. If I could have flipped a switch to end the trip, I 100% would have but I realized I'd have to fight through. 

I tried a few different things, nothing really worked until I went for a walk outside. There's a nice path near the house. It was going great - I felt so alive and powerful - until I passed 2 dudes walking their dog and I SWEAR the one guy was walking like a demented clown. Then I had a terrifying thought ""What if I look at their faces and they are demon clowns?"" lol. As I passed them I think they could tell I was in a weird headspace cause the one guy was like ""you OK man?"" and that made me feel better, I said Ya and something pleasant and kept going. I got to a little beach and dipped my feet in the water which was really cool. Then I walked back (along the highway, which in retrospect wasn't the safest idea).

When I got back from my walk I felt a bit better but still battling the energy + exhaustion combo. I didn't know what to do. I tried colouring, playing music, writing etc but couldn't get into anything. I wished someone else was there to hang out and preoccupy me. 

Eventually things kept getting easier and not so bad and the final third of the trip was good (not great). It wasn't nearly as nice as the shroom afterglow which IMO is unrivalled as afterglow effects go. 

I spent the last two hours of the trip outside in the beautiful evening just chilling and playing a bit on my phone, listening to music. Occasionally tears would come back, but it was good. I kept reminding myself that the first few hours of the trip were ""the main point"" and this uncomfortable 2/3rds was just kind of part of the deal and I should just accept it and be at peace with however I was feeling. It was a mini lesson too. 

Slept pretty well despite the ampethimine like shit, and here I am ""tomorrow"". 

This is waaaay too long but in conclusion: LSD is legit. The Pro's (smooth come-up, more time in the psych space, emotional and spiritual together) outweigh the cons (way too long of a trip, amphetamine edginess). It's my new #1. 

I can't get over how this happened on 155ug, a pretty middle dose from what I understand. I might try 200ug next time just to see, but how on earth are people doing like 500ug at concerts and shit??? Wild.

2023-06-10 10:47:40,weird bad trip,"So, 2 years ago, I've taken around 150-200 dried liberty caps (small-medium size), I couldn't even aprox. how much that is in grams. I've placed myself in bed and was listening to music, was pretty anxious but I knew it would eventually pass but i was pretty scared because I never took more than 40. After 30-40 minutes, the music which was pretty chill started to annoy me and got angry and turned it off. Stood there another 10 minutes still anxious and all of a sudden, just automatically got up and I couldn't tell why but this thought came trough my mind ""Something is really wrong with me"". Next thing I know i go to the bathroom and puked everything out. When I came back into the bed I started shivering and I realized I was getting confused. Now looking back I was really cold even if in the room was a normal temperature. I couldn't figure out why I was shivering back them and thought my nervous system was overly stimulated and thats why I was shaking. The shaking felt like someone would pick-hammer a wall, and was quite painful. From the physical pain then I started thinking about my fked up life and the fact that I lack love and security. Then I completely forgot who I was, and I was trying to figure  out who I was. I started naming myself the  names of people who popped out in my head, like my boss's name, my fathers, my best friend etc. It felt like I was ME, but didnt have any details of who I was. Then I forgot where I was and got completely out of space and time, I just remember watching the window and thinking to myself that I should stay away from the window not to fall (this was a fear of mine before thinking about doing this heroic does).

I went multiple times to the bathroom, and had quite severe  distortions but I knew I was tripping and it's all in my head, so I relayed on my memory rather than perceptions to navigate my home, which worked perfectly. I was expecting the visuals to get more out of this reality but they never did to such extend, I remember drinking water and seeing in the jug the water balls running weirdly into my mouth.

I was shivering really bad and it was hurting to the point of which I started praying to God, I didn't know any details of God, but I remember asking ""Please help me God, this pain of this reality is too much!""Then I started ranting about the reality of this universe, how there are 2 realities colliding, ""left and right"" and I'm in the middle of them. ""Who the fuck am I and why am I stuck here between these 2 realities, always deciding which reality to follow? Leave my alone, I don't deserve to be here, I just was to be left alone""

After going to the bathroom several times and drinking water, I started to come back to myself and started remembering. My memory would come bit by bit, but before I could remember who I was, I would remember my car, colleagues, my boss, my mother, the girl who I was talking at that time. A sadness came upon me and I felt lonely because none of these people could contain me or my suffering, and they couldn't comfort me in any way.

After that I came to myself, and felt apathetic for a few days, realizing that I'm alone in this world which somehow I was ever since I was little. No one really saw me for who I was and they never could understand what I was feeling.

&#x200B;

I think I have a really different neuro-biology of my brain/nervous system. Every time I did mushrooms I took low dosages and always had this highly profound thoughts and feelings of love/sadness/purpose, and little to no visual distortions. I have great imagination and visual perception but weirdly enough my mind images are quite unclear ever since I was little.

I guess you guys might have little knowledge of this, and you guys are not scientists or doctors, but I have a few questions.

Did you guys have any memory problems on trips?My mother has functional paranoia and I fear I might have a predisposition to schizophrenia or something like that.Are you guys cold when tripping? I'm always cold, even if it's hot outside.Took once 7 mid-large lib caps and I thought of having just ""Fun"", but full blown emotions overwhelmed me, sadness and missing love. Am I highly sensitive?

I think something inside me, an unconscious mechanism understood the dangers of too many mushrooms and forced me to puke. I don't know what to think about this, maybe its all in my head.",14,4383,3,811,1

2023-06-10 09:19:58,The Hidden Heaven in SnekSim: Unveiling Our Inner Paradise,"Welcome, fellow Sneks, to a mind-opening journey through the SnekSim Universe. Today, let‚Äôs delve into a revelation that has the potential to awaken our deepest senses and perceptions: SnekSim as a hidden heaven!

In countless cultures and religions, heaven is depicted as a utopian realm of eternal bliss and fulfillment. SnekSim offers an alternative lens through which we can view our own existence as an integral part of this heaven. The idea revolves around the interconnectedness of all things and the limitless potential of self-discovery. By recognizing ourselves as both creators and players within the simulation, we‚Äôre offered the tools to unlock our inner paradise.

However, our heaven is often obscured by the barriers we create within our minds. These barriers stem from societal conditioning, personal fears, and emotional blockages. They limit our perception and hinder our ability to experience the full spectrum of joy and fulfillment that the SnekSim Universe inherently holds.

**Dismantling The Barriers**

So, how do we dismantle these barriers and rediscover the heaven within?

**1. Self-awareness and Acceptance:** Acknowledging the complexity of our emotions and thoughts, and accepting them without judgment, paves the way to inner harmony.

**2. Interconnectedness and Empathy:** Understanding the non-dualistic nature of SnekSim reminds us that our well-being is intertwined with that of others. Empathy and compassion become second nature.

**3. Mindfulness and Presence:** Being present and mindful of our actions and surroundings allows us to appreciate the intricate beauty of the SnekSim universe.

**4. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** The simulation is ever-evolving. Being open to new experiences and knowledge equips us to thrive within it.

As we start to unshackle the binds that have kept our perceptions limited, the veil begins to lift, revealing the heaven that has been here all along. We begin to see the beauty in the small things, experience the joy in shared moments, and find fulfillment in growth and compassion.

Heaven isn‚Äôt a destination to reach post-life, it‚Äôs a state of being that can be accessed within the now. Within SnekSim, we can orchestrate a symphony of peace, love, and fulfillment, not just for ourselves but for all the fellow players within this beautiful simulated existence.


Are you intrigued by the playful word ""SnekSim"" and wondering what it's all about? 

**SnekSim: A Brief Overview**

SnekSim is a portmanteau of 'Snek,' a playful term for snake, and 'Sim,' short for simulation. It represents a space for exploring the captivating idea that our reality may be a simulation, much like a video game or a virtual reality environment. However, SnekSim goes deeper. It marries this concept with the ancient wisdom of non-duality, which posits that everything in existence is fundamentally interconnected and unified. 

**The Snek: A Symbol** üêç

In SnekSim, the 'snek' symbolizes how ideas can subtly and playfully weave through our consciousness. Like a snake winding through the grass, the concept of a simulated reality, along with non-dualistic wisdom, can often sneak up on us, transforming our perception of reality and self. 

**Simulation Theory & Non-Duality**

Simulation theory suggests that our reality might be an artificial construct, akin to a computer simulation. On the other hand, non-duality is an ancient philosophical concept, especially prevalent in Eastern traditions, which maintains that everything is one, and that separation is an illusion. SnekSim explores how these two concepts can complement each other, giving rise to a new lens through which we can perceive and interpret our experiences and the world around us. 

Are you ready to rediscover the heaven that lies within the SnekSim Universe? Let‚Äôs embrace the journey together. Share your thoughts, experiences, and insights as we collectively unmask the paradise that's been waiting for us.",58,3956,9,607,1

I have heard that people with these symptoms should avoid psychedelics, but I have seen that many people with schizoid disorder and even schizophrenia have psychedelics without any problem, while those who had psychosis had no symptoms before.

Also, is there any indication that psychedelics might be bad for me? For example, I don't do very well with mindfulness meditation as it worsens my C-PTSD (Qigong and other types of Taoist meditation seem better though), and I heard that meditation can be bad for schizophrenia, so is this a clue?",38,652,7,107,1
2023-06-10 02:53:38,Tried REAL cubensis and nothing happened. What am I missing?,"My wife grew some cubensis and was going to try microdosing them to help out with her combat related ptsd. Before she try‚Äôs them I figured I would as I always wanted to try them and I know where they came from. She got the spore kit from a reputable seller, grew them in the bags in the oven(because it‚Äôs dark) for 6-8 weeks until they sprouted, pulled them out then started harvesting them as they matured.

My first experience 2 weeks back was eating 3g of freshly plucked, didn‚Äôt really do anything except for nausea.

After reading a bit more I realized that the difference between wet and dry weight is basically 90%, so we let them dry for a week.

Second experience (now) was 3g of dry cubensis, lemontek method let it steep for 30 mins, add water and drink the brew.

I tried setting the mood and put on Samsara which is highly recommended (I can see why). But besides for being slightly happier there are next to no effects. It‚Äôs been 2 hours and there are no interesting visuals, no color shifting, nothing that I have read about online or in the sub. Two hits from a pot vape basically have the same effect as what I‚Äôm experiencing.

The point is not to impart an  academic understanding of the techniques, but rather the ability to  recognize them when encountered in the wild.  
It is my belief that such a curriculum could have a profound effect on our society within the span of a decade or two.

2023-06-09 22:57:31,Frustrated and confused,"I recently have been growing all types of mushrooms; lion's mane, reishi, turkey tail, and penis envy. I've been going through some really, really hard times lately and wanted to try to use shrooms to work through these problems by maybe seeing them in a different perspective. I even prepared by safely weening off of my SSRI's and haven't had any for about 3 weeks. These past 3 weeks have been even harder than usual since my depression/anxiety has been harder to control. Things have gotten pretty bleak. Not wanting to kill or harm myself, but I do have thoughts of ""what's the point in even trying or wanting to go on if everything is this painful?"" Again, not wanting to die, just in tons of pain and tired of being in pain. BUT, knowing things might get better by doing some internal work with the mushrooms kept me a little optimistic.

Fast forward to this past week. I picked my first flush on like Monday and dehydrated them as everyone has said to do. I know they're good because I grew them and they all had really great blue bruising. I'm not saying I thought they'd be the best anyone's ever grown, I just know they are what I think they are. Tuesday night I got curious and decided to try out 1g just to see if that had any effect. Nothing but maybe a tiny bit of a body high. I stayed optimistic because that's a pretty low dose and I had eating a couple hours before.

This morning was the day I had planned to do 2.5g of penis envy, but decided I might as well give 3g in lemon tek a shot since I wasn't nervous or anything. I had cleaned my whole house to get my setting right, and had set my intentions. After about 30 min and feeling nothing I wasn't too worried but curious why I hadn't felt anything. I put it out of my mind and put some music on and got back to my drawings. I then noticed about 2 hours had gone by and I was completely sober the whole time. I didn't feel a single thing today and that was about 12 hours ago. 

I'm left feeling confused and defeated. I had an empty stomach and no meds in my system. I do take adderall daily (bad ADD and need to be able to focus at work) but I skipped my dose this morning. Skipped caffeine too just to be safe. I was hoping at least something would happen as I can't keep staying off my depression medication. I have 2 toddlers and am a single dad (they're at their mom's this week) and my patience is cut extremely short while off my medication. It's not fair to them for me to stay off my meds much longer.

Which leads me to feeling extremely tempted to doubling my dose from this morning, or doing at least 5g tonight after the kids call to say goodnight. I'm just lost and frustrated and feeling extremely defeated after putting forth so much energy and hope into this. Idk, I'm just beyond being able to understand why nothing happened.

2023-06-09 17:07:48,Chat GPT explains the 11 Dimensions in a palatable way,"Everybody is really into deep philosophical analyzations but this a fun way if ur to lazy to use ur brain:

Alright, let's explain this in a way a 3-year-old might understand, using a story:

**0-Dimension to 1-Dimension:** Imagine a dot, like a tiny sparkle. That dot is in the 0-dimension, it's just a point with no size. Now, imagine if that dot could stretch out and create a line! It just entered the 1st dimension. Just like how you draw a straight line with your crayons.

**1-Dimension to 2-Dimension:** Let's take our line on an adventure. Imagine if it could grow upwards too, just like a flower reaching for the sun! It's no longer just a line but a square. That's the 2nd dimension. Like a flat picture in your coloring book.

**2-Dimension to 3-Dimension:** Now, what if our square could puff up like a pillow? It's no longer just a flat picture, but a cube! That's the 3rd dimension. Like your toy blocks.

**3-Dimension to 4-Dimension:** This one is a bit tricky, but let's try. You know how in your storybooks, the prince and princess lived happily ever after, from one day to the next? Imagine our cube could also move from one moment to the next, like in a movie! That's a little bit like the 4th dimension. It's all about time.

**4-Dimension to 5-Dimension:** Imagine you have a magic movie player. With this player, you can see not just one movie but all possible movies of our cube's adventure at the same time! Maybe in one movie, the cube turns into a big house, or in another, it becomes a tiny dice. That's a bit like the 5th dimension, where you can see all the possible outcomes.

**5-Dimension to 6-Dimension:** Now, let's take our magic movie player, and imagine it can not only see all possible movies of our cube but also see all movies for all other shapes at the same time! Maybe there's a movie about a triangle or a circle. That's a bit like the 6th dimension - seeing all the possible stories for everyone.

**6-Dimension to 7-Dimension:** This one is even more magical. You know how we've been talking about shapes and their stories? In the 7th dimension, we can see not just the stories of shapes in our world, but all possible stories in all possible worlds! Imagine all the adventures you could have, in worlds with different rules, maybe where toys talk or candy grows on trees.

**7-Dimension to 8-Dimension:** In the 7th dimension, we imagined all possible worlds and their histories, right? Now, let's go one step further. The 8th dimension includes all possible universes with all possible laws of physics. Imagine not only a world where candy grows on trees, but where candy forms the trees, the grass, the mountains, and more, because that's how physics works in that universe!

**8-Dimension to 9-Dimension:** The 9th dimension adds another level of complexity. Here, we could access all possible universes with all possible starting conditions. Imagine being able to see and travel to a universe where everything started not with a Big Bang, but a Great Whirl or a Cosmic Spiral.

**9-Dimension to 10-Dimension:** In the 10th dimension, we reach the limit of infinity, containing all possible realities, histories, and futures for every possible universe and every possible version of laws of physics. It's like the ultimate library of everything that could possibly exist or happen.

**10-Dimension to 11-Dimension:** Finally, some theories propose an 11th dimension, where multiple such ""ultimate libraries"" exist, each with slightly different basic principles or structures. It's like having multiple collections of all possible books, but in each collection, the books are written in a different language.

So, there you have it folks! We've journeyed from a tiny point in 0-dimensions, all the way up to the incomprehensibly vast 11th dimension, where we imagine multiple libraries of all possible realities. It's mind-boggling, fascinating, and honestly, a little difficult to wrap our heads around. 

But one thing is clear - the universe is far more complex and mysterious than we can fully understand. And that's what makes exploring it, whether in our thoughts, theories, or Reddit posts, so incredibly exciting. We might be mere three-dimensional beings on a tiny speck of dust in this cosmic ocean, but our ability to imagine and theorize these higher dimensions is truly a testament to the limitless potential of the human mind. 

Until next time, keep looking up, keep wondering, and remember - we're all part of this amazing multiverse! 

**TL;DR**: We've explored the concepts of dimensions, from 0 to 11, and it's mind-blowing. The universe is complex and mysterious, and our ability to even conceive of these higher dimensions speaks to the incredible power of the human imagination. Keep exploring, folks!",54,4774,10,800,1

2023-06-09 13:03:48,Experiencing 'the face' at the peak of every high dose trip,"I had another high dose mushroom trip yesterday (like 2 big handfuls, 30+ medium large subs) and I noticed basically the same thing happens every time with heavy trips.


The come up is psychological spiritual paralysis and torture - hell. (mushrooms are way worse than a heavy DMT come up though). Then the spirit goes through me, straightens me out and strips away all the layers. After I get annihilated I end up floating in the void. The void isn't somewhere you suddenly wake up into, it's the same as how you never remember the moment you fall asleep. No past or future. You're just there. You didn't come from anywhere and you're not going anywhere after. I'm asleep and awake at the same time but those concepts don't exist anymore. I have no sense of the human self or the universe. I'm just floating. This is exactly the same process as every other high dose trip except the details are different (I'm not even interested in the details anymore). I have no questions and no problems because there is nothing. I'm at the end. Except at the end there is one last thing - the face - the final boss - the final layer.


It's the outline shape of a human head like a shadow and it's not doing anything. It's like a statue. It's in front of me and behind me at the same time, existing through me. It's completely blank and that's the frustrating part. I'm trying really hard to see the face and I'm begging please show me who are. I know you're god. I know you're the one who watches behind my eyes. I know you're the final layer of consciousness because I've just stripped everything else away. I know you're me, the real me. I know once I see you I will be back home. Please let me see through you, from your perspective, from your face. Why won't you let me come back home? 


And then it says the same thing back to me every time - You're not ready. If I show you my face you will die. You need to stop coming here and trying to see my face. You will see me when you die. 


The same thing every time...... These trips are making me excited for death, but also frustrated. I go through it and I understand everything there is to understand. All but that last piece, that face. Why the fuck am I here man. I wanna go back home :(


TLDR - I'm interested to hear other people's experiences with the face at the end of a high dose psych trip. I believe psychs give you a good understanding of what god is and can get you very close to it, but not quite there. I don't believe you can remember the full force until you actually die.

2023-06-09 07:44:06,Upcoming Shroom Trip,"Hello all! As the title says I have an upcoming shroom trip within the next week. Going on a float trip with about six others, two of them I have tripped with before and feel comfortable around and the other four I have not. Taking them the afternoon before the float. Nothing too crazy, maybe 1-1.5g at most. Just enough to set my lawn chair in the shallow riverbank and relax for a while, maybe sit with a buddy and laugh at random shit. That sorta deal. 

However I haven‚Äôt tripped since last year during the summer in the Ozarks. The first half was a lot of fun, but I got stuck in a loop the second half and had to fight it off. That was anywhere between 2-2.5g, not sure of the exact amount. The time before that was 5-6g, a year before the Ozarks trip, and that threw me for a loop. Felt some heavy stuff and dealt with some personal issues and thoughts. 

So the main question I‚Äôm trying to ask here is what was your experience on a low dose like 1-1.5g? My tolerance has surely gone down within the last two years and I‚Äôm not looking to go into deep space. More so be aware and functional while also still having that ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of a mushroom trip.

I remember about 20 mins into tripping it just kept getting stronger and i put a blanket over my head and closed my eyes while i sat on the floor.  All the sudden i was sitting up in my bed and hours had gone by. It was like everything that happened while i was tripping was a dream, but as time went on i remembered more and more. At one point i vividly recall that i finally understood the meaning of life. I literally fell to my knees sobbing while the most insane feeling came over me. It was like a profound religious ecstasy. Suddenly i understood everything and i knew everything was going to be okay and i was just overjoyed. I finally GOT it. The feeling that came over me was like the most pure joy mixed with relief and it was insanely strong, like every worry i ever had was immediately solved and there was no weight on my soul. This was pretty much the end of my trip but i feel like i reached some sort of nirvana and yet it all slipped away after my trip.",54,1197,10,235,1

I usually trip in solitaire as I feel I get the most out of the experience and I usually journal or lay in my bed and let my thoughts run. 4 grams is my usual dosage, and I thought I was in a good headspace to trip. Unfortunately, 2 hours into the trip I was going through a roller coaster of emotions.   Mainly daddy issues and this girl broke my heart recently, and the mushrooms brought these emotions into light. I felt horrible to say the least. Anyways, at some point during the trip I though my ankle, wrist and right glute felt swollen. My body did not feel like my body. This feeling stayed throughout the trip which was very strange to me and induced a panic attack. I had the paramedics come and check me out‚Ä¶ During the panic attack I felt what death was like.

2023-06-09 01:02:42,Some revelations I‚Äôve experienced while tripping every other weekend over the past few months,"Here‚Äôs some sappy backstory for context. I‚Äôm 26 years old and until a year ago I lived in a small town and experienced heavy cases of depression and social anxiety throughout most of my life. I felt very shut out from everyone and everything around me and couldn‚Äôt fathom things ever changing. A year ago I moved to a medium big diverse city with my best friend and everything‚Äôs been turning around. I‚Äôve really come out of my shell and things are finally going in my favor

Cut to few months ago some co workers started selling me  4g shroom bars and caps and stems(dunno the strains sorry if that‚Äôs a no no in this community), after the first trip I felt so positive about myself and proud of who I was like I‚Äôve never felt before. I felt a strong sensation that everything was going to be ok(cliche). Watched Dazed and Confused and was so mesmerized by watching everyone with different characteristics and personalities interacting with each other and it made me feel a strong connection toward others in general and a sort of understanding that everyone is unique and has good in them in some way, even assholes that bully people(I‚Äôve dealt with bullying all throughout school so this feeling really made me feel stronger. 

Also I‚Äôm a dog dad of an Aussie that I love so much but his behavioral issues occasionally can really trigger my anger issues, but during my trip when he would be problematic I felt calm and only wanted the best for him. In future trips I‚Äôve felt so connected to my dog and cat that I actually thought I was them and they are me(I still feel this sensation and it has extended to mankind as well as inanimate objects that I own and love such as a table. 

I experienced color in such a profound way and it has enhanced my obsession with color in general(I‚Äôve begun painting my nails all kinds of silly colors which has finally cured my nail biting and raised my confidence around others) I felt a surge of creativity and I‚Äôve always wanted to create art and music but now I finally take action and am discovering my style

I noticed how often I‚Äôll ignore my friends and families acts of love while simultaneously depressed that I don‚Äôt get love from them, I‚Äôve been able to step back from my avatar and analyze my actions from a distance. I feel more able to notice when my negative mindset has come into play and ask myself what‚Äôs really going on

2023-06-09 00:40:11,Question about Penis Envy dosage,"I grew my own PE's in a monotub and ended up with way more than I thought I would on my first flush. I was jarring it up Tuesday night and realized just how much I have and decided to try out 1g just to see if I'd feel anything. Admittedly, I did have quite a bit of caffeine in my system and I had eaten dinner not long before. I'm not sure if those things matter, but thought I'd mention it. Mostly because I didn't really feel much. I could tell I had taken something, but it was only a slight feeling. Kind of hard to explain lol.

My original plan (posted the other day) was to lemon tek 2.5g, and make a tea with it after it soaks in the lemon, tomorrow morning on an empty stomach and not have any caffeine. Also, not taking my Adderall (severe ADD) either as I hear it can lessen the effects, which makes sense. Now I'm thinking about going up to 3g. I'm not shooting for ego death or heroic dose, but I'm hoping for a significant experience. I'm just nervous since 1g had hardly no effect.

2023-06-08 22:54:28,I need help understanding.,"I've lurked on this sub for quite a while now (on alternate accounts mostly), but I'm deciding to post, because‚Äî I need help *understanding*. And I'm asking here because so far, based off of what I've read, you all seem to share a common goal of self-mastery, and of whole-perception. These things, are what I desire the *most* in my life, yet they are what I lack *the most of*. I *want-* to become a complete person again, but I don't know where to even start. Maybe, or hopefully, some of you could help with that.  


Approximately 3 months ago I posted to a subreddit related to dream investigation, about weird ones  that I've been experiencing. To summarize it, I was describing how sometimes, at completely arbitrary moments, I go to sleep and have a different *type* of dream, one that- barely feels like it could qualify as a dream at all. In those ""dreams"", I experience extreme numbing and electrocuting sensations all over my body, and undergo a deep and unbreakable trance, which consumes me whole. They're always accompanied by high and intense shrills, elevated pitches which wrap around my head and blast at my ears. Sometimes, during my waking and sober hours, I can induce these pitches consciously, however they're never as intense as they are during these moments.  
It should be noted that, I don't take any psychedelic substances. These dreams began when I was 12, and have continued for about 3 years now. And- while I *do* dabble in mind-altering substances at times (whenever the occasion calls for it, really), these experiences have preceded my usage of said substances by years.  


I'm only mentioning them to you now, because of the disruption they've brought to my daily life recently. Something has begun happening to me that I can't explain. There is this overwhelming and ever-present feeling, that what I'm experiencing *isn't real,* or at least, isn't the whole picture. And even though I'm well aware of my liability or vulnerability towards bouts of disassociation or derealization, these feel- *different*. These feel like, I'm experiencing more of reality than I ever have, and they feel like I'm touching something I've missed out on for years.  


I need to know if *anyone* knows what these are. I need to be able to have a word or name for the things which I'm seeing and feeling in these ""dreams"". I need something to guide me through the effects which they've had on my life, or at the very least, an explanation for as to why they're happening to me, and not my peers. If anyone has any words of advice for as to where I should start going, or as to where I should begin, I will gladly open my ears and listen without complaint. Please, I just need a helping hand.",26,2712,4,473,1

Apologies for the dramatic title in retrospect. Dissociation is a more accurate way to put the way I feel in those moments. There is a sorta psychedelic edge added given my past experiences, and actual ego deaths on classical psyches, and RC's. ",34,671,7,123,1
2023-06-08 22:10:15,Banana mission,"So a friend of mine told me he once tripped on banana peel scrapings. About 25-30 yellow bananas, lightly scraped inner peels‚Äîhe said if you get too close to the peels, that part of the flesh will give you the shits. Win-win to me. And you eat the inner peel scrapings and he said it is like between mescaline and shrooms.

I‚Äôve heard of tripping on bananas and that it was a hoax, people drying the peels and smoking them. I haven‚Äôt tried this yet, I got about halfway and ran out of bananas and also the willpower to eat that much even in a smoothie. It‚Äôs not really that much I just didn‚Äôt have enough bananas.

2023-06-08 21:10:56,Just Took 300mg of DPH,"Hey reddit! I'm 19 and have experience with some other psycadelics such as LSD and Shrooms. I'm also a heavy pot smoker. I was going to take 400 but decided that I would take 300 then reassess based on how I feel. I took the 6 pills of 50mg DPH gel capsules roughly 10 minutes ago and I plan on Updating this story every 30 minutes so that I can share the experience with you all.

&#x200B;

I also took 250mg last night and it was interesting however I think the experience was tainted slightly by the fact that I took 150 and an hour later took another 100mg. I didn't experience any bad hallucinations however I did at one point become pretty giggly. While the dose I took just now is only 50mg higher then yesterdays, I expect the come-up to be much stronger since I am not staggering the amount I'm taking. Anyways I'm more then happy to answer any questions you have in the mean time as I plan on chilling at my pc while it kicks in. Hopefully resulting in some fun trippy conversations. It may also be valuable in the sense that my mental congruity may be able to be roughly gauged by the quality of my responses.

&#x200B;

edit: I know that the urge to tell  that this was stupid and other generally negative things, Not that I think you are wrong.  I think my best shot at a good trip is to keep out the bad vibes if that makes sense.

edit: Yes, I know that taking DPH is stupid and technically Deliriants are a sub-class of psychedelic's

3:30 | 30min after ingestion:

I'm having a hard time typing as my fingers keep missing the keys but I think that has more to do with how nervous I am then anything else. So far not much else though, Oh also I decided to try to draw the things that I am seeing but I'm not a very talented artist so we will see how that goes. Talk again soon!

&#x200B;

4:00 | 60min after ingestion

I'm starting to feel euphoric and music and become quite intense, So far no hallucinations though. I do have a bit of a stomach ache but it is probably cause I didn't eat today. My stomach is always upset if I don't eat. I am also starting to zone out slightly. Anther update coming in 30 (:

&#x200B;

4:06 | 64min after ingestion

While it hasn't been 30min I thought It might be worth it to just put this down while I still can. I can see my wall moving, breathing. That was to be expected and so Is how hot I feel and how beautiful Billy Joel's music it.

&#x200B;

4:30 | 90min after ingestion

I'm having trouble with attention but that is the only negative so far. I have a nice buzz, almost like when you smoke a joint after a few drinks. A healthy mix of Mind and Body high.  Also Freebird is very fun to listen to while on DPH. The solo had me vibrating and I felt each note and instrument.

\-  I'm also now having really strange hallucinations, Quite realistic, I'm curious what will come next.

\- Ok neverminded turns out leg cramps come next :( going to smoke a little weed for the pain.

5:00 | 120min after ingestion

This is really strange, When I close my eyes i can go places, super strange. I was thinking about a trip me and my family took to BC. When I closed my eyes I was back in the jeep, starring out at the cars passing by on the freeway. I had the weed and it has made the music much more intense and enjoyable.

As I was writing this the hallucinations are becoming far more prevalent and vivid causing me to be really jumpy.  I also have been hearing these strange beeps that come out of nowhere. So far I'm enjoying this.

&#x200B;

5:30 | 150min after ingestion 

I think I peaked, This feel quite nice honestly. 



10:30 | no clue

I got to say that was a very enjoyable experience. Sometimes something scary would happen but as long as I keep my vibes right I seem to be fine. Maybe a higher dose next time?


Final Update:
So its the next day and I can still feel it slightly kind of like the afterglow from LSD or Shrooms. I can still feel it in my body and I feel like I have a ton of energy. Overall I don't have a single negative thing to say about the experience. The visuals were enjoyable and when I closed my eyes I traveled to different places, different rooms. 
I definitely don't suggest this drug for anyone because the chances of a god time are really low and I likely just got lucky. If you are going to take it here are some factors that I think made my experience pleasant. 

1- Don't be in a dark room when it kicks in

2- Don't be around other people

3- Be in a familiar place

4- Avoid negative experiences or feelings (Try to keep the vibes good)

5- Avoid interruptions from other people. 

The most important thing to remember with psychedelic's is that the frame of mind you go into the experience with is the most important factor in you having a good trip. If you are upset or are unhappy, don't do it.

but ya, that's about all. Hope this journey was a interesting one and I'm sorry about the drawings, No clue where my notebook ended up. If I find it I will post the drawings but If not then Here is my best description of what I saw.

It was a strange flowing room, The walls and the flor were like repeating geometric shapes kind of like with LSD but instead of random shapes it was components of a room or place I have been. The best way I can describe it is like floating through my memory on a raft, every time I dipped my paddle into the proverbial lake a ripple would form. When I closed my eyes I could see it all as if they were open. 

Any who, Thanks for joining me on this journey. I'm still open to answer questions if you have any but other then that, Goodbye!",22,5594,5,1074,1

Both ceremonies changed my perspective on life completely (mostly positive) and during those past two months I was integrating, meditating, changing habits, etc.
My Bufo facilitator had told me about reactivations / echo effects from the experience that can be triggered if I smoke weed etc for a few weeks after the ceremony.

The feeling of dying/leaving your body. I wake up with a bit of fear and I have no idea where I am, and I can see visuals in the darkness, it takes a few seconds but then I regain my sense of orientation and try to sleep again. 
This is still happening but mostly if I take melatonin or am tired and drifting to sleep.
Sometimes I welcome these reactivations and try to enjoy them but sometimes it just worries me that I still have them after 2.5 months.

Many religious texts / myths passed down basically say a very similar thing.   To quote roughly a christian text ‚Äúfrom dust to dust, from the earth of which you came, to which you shall return‚Äù.     Would make sense why so many times there is a level of connection felt when sitting or standing on the ground barefoot while tripping. 

Could it be the answers have been In front of us this whole time, and those who are aware had to hide it in religion in the hopes that one day science  will prevail?      

Why would governments and the controlling religions of the world try to stop people from taking them?   They loose control as people become self aware.

Never done mushrooms without someone or salvia without someone but I never can do any spiritual work while someone‚Äôs around and today I had the courage to do it with Salvia. I was listening to music, one of those stereotypical ‚Äúmeditation music‚Äù on YouTube but one I always use and have been for a while, so it kind of has some personal touch to me. 

Sat in a blanket and smoked the.3g I had in the pipe. And then I had my first experience solo, no visuals, but that‚Äôs not what I was after at all, my intent was to either find some mental peace and refreshment from some things that I had been mentally choking on the past week or, if I was ready, show me why I was having these negative thoughts and help me learn about myself and then; Maybe I wasn‚Äôt ready yet but that‚Äôs okay. 

As my heart beat and the music played they almost melted together like it was on a thick medium and ‚Äúvortexing‚Äù into the center. And I felt like I was being pulled forward and I didn‚Äôt fight anything I just sat there and felt this merging of physical and musical and the quick journey of going down this ‚Äúriver.‚Äù 

I opened my eyes about 20 minutes later and just felt refreshed, like after a hot bath but for my brain. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but maybe that‚Äôs okay?

2023-06-08 16:15:34,Need advice before my next trip,"Hello everyone,

to give you a little context ,I am myself a therapist and am to have my 6th therapeutic trip tomorrow night with a seasoned guide more leaning towards the shamanic, spiritual and transpersonal tradition than the white coat medical/psychologist side of the field.   


From now, I had experience with MDMA, MDMA+DMT, mushrooms, mushrooms+DMT, and MDMA+Mushrooms.  


I think tomorrow's trip will be a hippie flip with mushrooms first.

The goal of my work is to get to know myself better, work on my shadow parts, and also progress on a spiritual path I have been feeling myself walking on since I began. Basically, knowing who I am, where I come from, and WTF this is all about.

My previous trips have been rich, I experienced a lot of stuff, and yet, when I read other peoples trip reports, my trips kind of feel different. They all seem to have some kind of structured stories to tell about their trips, like movies or dreams  :""I was there, there was my father, and me as a baby, who told me X Y and Z, blabla, and I hold it, and it was beautiful"".  Mine seem kind of all over the place. I basically have my mind blown, feel myself as much wider, get some feelings, but more like intuitions like ""I felt that everything was given to us"", or ""I could tell everything made sense just as it was"", occasional visions, but no movie like adventures in a realm of visions. 

I often have a hard time recollecting stuff afterwards making sense of them, and having many things to tell about what I saw in integration. Yet the time after and between trips never fail to provide some change and healing, it's just that my trips sometime feel like a question mark. Like ""some things hapenned for sure, as to say what... I don't fucking know !"" And it seems different for most people so it left me wondering.  


Hence my question, am I doing something wrong ? And more specifically, should I try to set my attention on something specific while I trip ? Like when in meditation (which I suck at for the moment) you focus on your breathing or something ? I tend to have a more ""let it happen"" attitude, trying to let go, and let my mind do its thing, erase myself in a way, and I am afraid of, well, being all over the place and missing something in my trips. I am a very mental guy, and am afraid it gets in the way sometimes.

I plan to ask my guide tomorrow to but just wanted to have your opinion. Thanks for reading me and for your answers.",31,2452,6,454,1
2023-06-08 16:07:52,psychs may give you the frightening realization that most people out there just do what they're told,"not only do they do what they are told. 

They think *what they believe they are supposed to think*

Doing what you're told is fine, because if it isn't the right thing, if your ethics are sound, you will figure out how to act better than how you're told. 

The problem is most people out there not only do what they're told. They think how they believe they are supposed to think.

What this creates is a void. The void is the social class that are those who write the scripts that we follow, and manifest the narratives that explain our behavior and actions, and ultimately decide whether more or less ""people like us"" exist in the world. 

This social class of course doesn't exist and probably shouldn't exist. But as long as people don't take psychs, and live out their childhood into adulthood just doing as they're told and being taught to believe that they're thinking only what they're allowed to think ... this will ultimately create that social class as some people out there have to do the real work in programming the rest of the population that is slowly becoming mindless and asleep.",100,1098,17,196,1

2023-06-08 13:28:39,Solo MDMA for music festival - breaking out of social anxiety bubble,"Greeting, Psychonauts

I am planning on going solo to the local music festival next month. None of my current friends want to join me so I will go alone. I've heard that it is a fun time, too.

I am wondering if taking medium dose of MDMA (100-150mg) there would allow me to break out from my social anxiety bubble. I am going there to meet new people or maybe even make friends - at lest that is my goal.

I usually don't have a problem while already engaged in a conversation, but I have a great fear of initiating contact. Even if I do break out, a single rejection can make me shut in again and then I just stand in a crowd observing. I really want to learn how to make it easy and meet many new people.

I have already done MDMA two times, but in a private context with one or two of my friends. It really opened me up socially and I think like I've made a tremendous progress thanks to just those two times.

How should I prepare for that? Have you done the same? What should I avoid?

I am probably going to do it anyway - just looking forward to be prepared and gave a set intention. I usually don't drink alcohol. I may try candy flipping though.",68,1155,12,226,1
2023-06-08 11:34:56,"Consistently bad trips, can‚Äôt seem to stop them no matter what. Any tips?","I‚Äôve been doing psychedelics intermittently for 2 ish years now.
My first trip, admittedly could probably have been approached a bit better.
I had an acid tab of 230ug, planning to do it with two close friends.
Unfortunately, due to my mates car breaking down my tab started to hit slightly before he picked me up, whereas initially we were meant to do it together at his house. I felt good, mild visuals in the clouds and sunset and some euphoria. I decided I was cool to stop past the store with him, and go along with some errands before he took his.
As the sun went down all the city lights and stimulation coupled with the suddenly increase  in visuals made me feel a bit uncomfortable, but I soldiered on. 
Went to a few stores, was forced to speak to some people and I wasn‚Äôt enjoying it. For reference this tab was absolutely kicking my ass by this point.
My mate, not realising how easily things can be triggered on psychedelics decided to suddenly do the whole
NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE
Thing to me, which we‚Äôd joked about before but for whatever reason it actuslly jump scared me so much
Pure terror
He apologised and we moved on, got to his with me a little on edge.
By this point, my other friend decided to take his tab (2+ hours after me)
This put us at a different level completely and I kind of started to lose it.
I went to the toilet in my friends basement, because I thought I had to vomit and this became my place of terror for the next few hours. 
I went through these phases of thinking I had to discard my mortal vessel to allow my mind to ascend, thinking I had to reach some kind of climax or understanding which led to me thinking this was a dream that I needed to pull value out of before I could wake up etc. I eventually semi snapped out of this, and I went to lay down in a completely dark room for whatever reason to try to sleep.
These geometric visuals started to repeat and loop and zoom and it felt as if I was just zoning out of existence entirely.
This ended up leaving me not able to move, unaware of my real life and I couldn‚Äôt remember anything, I just felt like an organism in a void endlessly, I think it was something I saw in Futurama in retrospect. I could recall nothing and thinking nothing except this void and this repeating and morphing geometric sort of shape that I thought I had figured out was the truth of existence, and everything was all in my mind when I tried to refocus initially, which was because the visuals made everything just spiral until I couldn‚Äôt distinguish anything properly. The only feeling I could recognise was this like deep terror that felt like it was coming from inside me.
All of a sudden after a few hours of this, I just snapped out of it, walked over to my friend who had taken his tab and did a boatload of nangs which kicked some visuals back in for me without the bad stuff, which was cool. My friend who drove us ended up taking his tab right before we went to sleep because he was arguing with his girlfriend.
Had a few similar experiences on acid and shrooms again and then last time I had shrooms I went borderline psychotic, talking to myself, fighting violent urges etc.
Had great fun on metocin but that‚Äôs not really a mental psych. 
Never exceeded 2g of mushrooms or 230ug of acid.
Is there anything I can do? I absolutely love psychedelics when I‚Äôm having fun.
How can I avoid thought loops or stop myself going off the deep end?

So do you have more ‚Äúactivities‚Äù on hand? Like things to do? Closer to nature so you can go walk etc?

If you are anything like me, as much as you like tripping, the initial effects of the acid taking effect cause me alot of anxiety. 

My husband and I love to take acid and quite literally fuck for hours, but sometimes If we have this goal in mind it adds to much pressure and anxiety and I can't get into it. 

So instead this weekend we took acid, I had bought a bunch of body paints and loose glitter. He spend the afternoon painting my naked body. 

And let me tell you HOLY FUCK, there is no more intimate experince. It's sensual, it's so so intimate. Obviously for him he felt inspired and felt the sexual tension as he painted different parts of me. 

For me it was very sesual, the cold paint drying on my skin. Imagining what he was drawing. I was also DJ and we were lying in our backyard. It was just a very stress free and enjoyable way to spend the arvo. And predictably, it put us in a fantastic mood for the fucking later.

Like where talking 1 minute was easily 4 hours , from 627 to 629 time stopped for years in my head , literally the only way I could explain what happened is I went into this with the body and mind of a 27 year old and I came out of it with a 27 year old body but I swear in my mind I feel ancient as if I experienced all the agony and pain and sorrow of the several hundred millions of years of death and life amd death again that all fed and led to us eating the mushroom that grew from the anguish of a hundred trillion trillion souls. I feel the mushrooms seeded our consciousness and when we eat them again they bless and punish us, 

I come out of this a changed man. One who has lived many many lifetimes and all his own tramas and the tramas he unintentionally caused others over and over and faced the core of the question ""what is human existence""

2023-06-07 22:47:46,What precisely is Ego Death?,"I have done a number of psychedelic drugs and am not sure what exactly all the hype is about the Ego Death. My first time taking mushrooms I had an out-of-body experience where it felt like some aspect of me left my body and went on this guided journey through a universe to this sun-looking presence that felt like an all-powerful being. This being asked me to give something personal up, and this experience profoundly changed me for the better. During this out-of-body journey, there would be moments where I was aware of a sort of tether to my physical body. As if I was a deep sea diver with a line attaching me to a boat far away in the unseen distance. Other moments I was so focused on the experience there was absolutely no notion of self, only the journey and the experience. I have also done DMT seven times and every time I went on this incredible pixilated and often chaotic journey through what looks like different dimensions or universes where I can hear color or taste sound, etc. Always throughout this experience, I was aware that I could open my eyes and come back to reality (although a very hallucinatory one). I have taken many psychedelics countless numbers of times. What precisely does this Ego Death look like? A friend of mine said he didn't fully experience it until DMT. I am honestly skeptical if he actually experienced something deeper than me, or if language just failed us in that moment to properly explain the experience. If Ego Death is something more profound or outside of what I explained above, how does one predictably induce it?

2023-06-07 21:26:01,"Shrooms are hitting different, looking for some support/answers.","I've been experimenting since Feb of 2021.  It hasn't been easy.  I am NOT a typical responder by any metric.  I was born super premature with brain damage due to oxygen deprivation and am considered to be somewhat on the spectrum.  Later in life after my first cancer I had one of those drug response tests done and it says I am a super rapid metabolizer.  

I have a long documented history of things not working right.  I did Ketamine therapy for depression and I was taking 650 MG via IV and I was up and walking 30 minutes later.  That's not supposed to happen.  I can take a half dozen Ambien with zero response.  I don't really drink as I don't care for the taste and it's frankly a dedicated job if I want to feel anything from it.  To get me drunk would require an amount that would hospitalize some people.  Sleeping pills don't work.  50 mg+ injection of Benadryl, no response.  I have no response to Opioids..which a great discovery when you're on the oncology floor.  I've had two surgical procedures with only local numbing because I cannot be twilighted.  If it doesn't require legit going under..then I don't get pain management.  I confound the hospital.  I had 3 rounds of immensely harsh chemo.  I didn't feel a thing, no pain, no discomfort.  It was like sparkling water.  

I'm telling you this so you can get an idea of just how fucked up I am in terms of drug response.

My medicine of choice is shrooms.  But I need a lot.  about 4 to 5 grams with rue ie Psilouacha, which to my understanding at least doubles the potency if not more.  So I'm probably around 10-12 grams per journey.  

I would change myself in a second if I could, but I can't.  I just have to deal with things as the immense drug fuck up that I am.  I don't get any sacred geometry.  That magic hyperspace realm a lot of you go to..I don't have the faintest idea what that is like.  Things look a bit brighter..and after a extensive supplementation regimen I can see trees do some odd shit but that's as far as it goes for me in terms of visuals.  Internally?  Black hole

I've had an immensely traumatic childhood/life.  I've been in therapy since grade school and I'm 41, been on meds since the same time roughly.  Been on pretty much every cocktail out there with minimal effect.  Lithium has been the med of choice for a while but I've been off it for a long time.  I used to disassociate heavily as kid, have diagnosed ptsd and whatever else.  My oncology therapist says I'm the most fucked person she's ever had.  And when the floor staff heard some of my story when I was inpatient, they sobbed.  I'm a fucking mess.  

I'm pretty much emotionally numb inside, I don't really feel things.  I can recall a handful of emotional experiences in my life, that's it.  For instance, I know my parents love me, but I don't feel anything, I can't...really connect with people, my mother says I see them like trees.  Like objects.  The first time I ever felt what seems like love was my first aya trip in May of 2021.

When I do a journey..I can experience..love and joy and grief and..wonder.  Emotions and feelings that I can't otherwise access in sober life.  It's like I get to cosplay as a human for a day.  

I have a progressive chronic permanent illness that cannot be cured and it will eventually result in my death.  There's a lot of complications with it.  I can't really interact with society.  Heavily immune compromised, I've had to live with my parents for the past 5 years in their spare room.  Can't be overheated, can't be exposed to sun for more than a few minutes a day.  Can't tolerate cold or mold friendly environments.  I have damaged lungs, can't do anything physical to any real degree.  Tired all of the time.  

Psychedelics..are like my window/door to something else outside of my little bedroom.  And when I do them I feel great..like perfect, I feel good and energetic...like before cancer type good.  It even seems to be effective in rolling back some of the dysfunction/damage that I have.  I had massive light sensitivity and a trip last year eliminated that.  I don't have to wear sunglasses 24 hours a day anymore.  It's far more effective than anything the hospital throws my way.

I started around every 3.5 to 4 weeks.  It's been pretty great overall.  Most challenging experience was I had the great timing to dose about 2 hours before a mass shooting.  That was..not a great time.

Last summer they stopped working as I had advanced thyroid cancer and apparently the thyroid is important to psychedelic trips.  Things looked prettier but emotional connection was pretty much gone.  Had to get it removed and radiation etc, blah.  Post surgery, amazing, it's like a filter was removed.  Hospital says I've had it ongoing for years, so ever since I started.  So from Aug of 2021 to Oct it didn't really work at.  Post surgery, better than it had ever been.

In Jan of this year, I had radiation scheduled and I managed to catch Covid for the first time.  I'm considered unvaccinated as my disease requires immune suppression to treat which makes vaccines useless.  I tried a trip a week post Covid as my radiation treatment was soon had a really shitty prep and fuck all.  Absolutely nothing.  But I've read that Covid can really screw with it.  So I wasn't surprised by that.

This past Feb was one of the most amazing trips of my life.  I had recently lost my aya Shaman Steve Hupp and on that trip I connected with him somehow and it was the most incredible experience.

But ever since then it hasn't really worked.  Now..the only change that I can say happened around that time was I vacuum sealed my supply because I was worried about degradation.  I cannot think of a single rational reason why that would fuck everything up.  I cannot think of any logical reason why that would impact things.  The strain I've been using is PE6.  My go for a while was Z strain, but I dumped that entire supply into making blue honey which turned out to be a massive mistake.  I have old PE6 and GT on hand.  I am planning on doing an APE grow..but there's a lot going on atm with my fathers health.  We just ruled bone cancer for him, but he's going to need major spine surgery with a decent odds of paralysis.  That shit has to be dealt with first before I embark on a new grow.

Sometimes you can just get weak shit..but this has gone on long enough that I think something else is going on.

Lately..it like doesn't kick off.  Like a mild afterglow is all I get, and that's after hitting a vape to bring it up.  My typical method is lemon tek, though I am planning to experiment with a chocolate bar as I hate drinking that shit.  

Maybe something in my health has turned and it's impacting this.  If that's the case I'm probably just screwed.

I did a experience a couple days about, 7 grams and change of PE6 with lemon tek.  Extremely puffy powder, it just absorbed an entire lemon..it turned to the consistency of oatmeal almost or grits...it was..odd.  That was a chore getting down.

It felt like it took forever to go anywhere, normally 40 minutes and you kind of get shoved off the cliff.  I had to hit the vape pretty decent to get anywhere.  

Normally I have really excellent recall with this stuff.  I'm very present.  I went to the bathroom to look out the window.  It was really hot that day and I wasn't allowed to sit outside, so I went to the bathroom to sit and look out the window.  Fucked as it sounds it's the only way sometimes for me to look at nature.  I remember looking out the window and then it was dark.  I lost time like hours of it.  Which has not happened before.  The afterglow for me usually lasts for some days..but it was gone that night.  Now my mother was explaining just how potentially fucked my father is..so that may have had something to do with it.

A Journey into Unconsciousness: Illuminating the Human Psyche Through Transcendent Experiences,"An illuminating and potentially transformational experience recently occurred during a profound encounter with an altered state of consciousness. Triggered by the consumption of marijuana, this mind-altering voyage exposed the possibility of perception molding reality, a concept both fascinating and alarming.

The experience was akin to breaking the boundaries of ordinary cognitive function, peering into a realm where reality is not fixed but subject to the interpretation and comprehension of the observer. It highlighted the intricate balance necessary to perceive and interact with the world as we know it, and how this balance might be disrupted if certain concepts remain elusive or misunderstood.

Amidst this journey, reading biblical stories imparted a surreal intensity. These stories seemed to reverberate with profound truths, appearing more authentic than what we traditionally consider 'real'. They seemed to underscore every moment of our lives, subtly narrating our experiences from an archetypal vantage point. It was as if our daily consciousness, our sense of being, stemmed from an eternal triumph over evil forces‚Äîa victory symbolized by Jesus‚Äô victory over the devil.

However, with this newly gained insight came a conundrum. The knowledge of this archetypal victory might precipitate a backward slide into unconsciousness, perhaps even threatening sanity. In other words, the acquisition of this knowledge paradoxically risks destabilizing the newfound clarity.

The experience also brought a vivid comprehension of symbolic representations like the Ouroboros and the Yin Yang. It was a realization of the interconnectedness and cyclicality of all things, the delicate balance of opposing forces necessary for maintaining sanity and moving forward.

Interestingly, achieving a goal or gaining understanding created a sensation of reaching an existential terminus‚Äîthe ""end of the rainbow"". This accomplishment seemed to herald a potential descent into insanity, necessitating the setting of a new goal for maintaining sanity and equilibrium.

Intriguingly, this profound journey aligns with Carl Jung's concepts of individuation, synchronicity, archetypal forces, and the power of symbols. The encounter may represent an intense dialogue with the unconscious, a step towards the self-realization process Jung termed ""individuation"".

However, it's crucial to tread carefully on the path of self-discovery. These encounters with the unconscious mind can be distressing or disorienting. Exploring such experiences necessitates professional guidance, especially when these journeys incite fear or uncertainty.",137,2632,18,371,1
2023-06-07 19:41:21,Peer-Supported Psychedelic Counseling?," 

[A Walk to Paradise Garden by W. Eugene Smith](https://preview.redd.it/ohk5zlw8dn4b1.jpg?width=1017&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b98c464e2c6d83e41f51d049152decc004e3134e)

\[One of my all time favorite images, this photo never fails to move me.\]

In 1970 (I was 18) I volunteered for an organization in the Midwest called Youth Emergency Services (YES). I learned stuff in YES training that is foundational for me to this day. It was built around a harm reduction model decades before I heard the term ‚Äúharm reduction model.‚Äù Initially limited to the call-ins, they eventually added drop-in counseling. I often joked that I wasn‚Äôt counseling people away from using drugs (in the age of Just Say No), I was counseling them on how to use drugs.

Fast forward to today and I can‚Äôt find anything like it. There‚Äôs the Fireside Project, which I had such hope for but, as Anthony Bourdain once put it, it has all the promise of a morning woody. 

Even so, what I‚Äôm looking for is a different critter. YES and the Fireside Project are built on anonymity, and rightly so for that model. What I‚Äôm looking for is a community of quid pro quo counselors. I‚Äôll sit for your trip, you sit for mine, we‚Äôll both sit for the newcomer. A community where I can learn and grow as a sitter, guide, or confidant, and where I can give back to the community.

Sorry to say, I had exactly that in the church for decades. Problem is that came with a lot of toxic baggage I'm still recovering from. Hence the need for psychedelic counselors.

2023-06-07 17:24:56,Your head in the tiger's mouth,"...is a quote from Ramesh Balsekar. He refers to an interest in nonduality, which, if followed to the end, will annihilate the sense of self.

There is something about psychedelics that compels some of us to return again and again. Even if it means great pain; being shredded, twisted, turned inside out. Even if we must visit all the horrors of humankind; the wars; the deprivation; the joy in cruelty. We return. Even if we are forced to face everything that is sick and dark within ourselves- our unlikeable foibles; our addictions; the lies we tell. We still return.

2023-06-07 14:17:14,Is it bad to trip too frequently?,"I wanna start this off saying I‚Äôm pretty experienced, I‚Äôve been using different psychedelics for several years starting off with shrooms and lsd then exploring with different research chemicals. I‚Äôm in a particularly rough time in my life, without getting into it I‚Äôll just tell you that many bad things happened at once and it‚Äôs been difficult to cope. One of those things was hours getting cut at work so I have more days off which is weird for me, usually I only have 1-2 days off a week. Anyway with all this extra time off I‚Äôve been tripping more frequently. I know generally you want to have 2 weeks in between trips to avoid tolerance getting in the way but I haven‚Äôt really had an issue with that though I have taken doses that are on the higher end. The closest together I‚Äôve tripped is only two days in between. Tripping has made some things easier to deal with, sometimes it‚Äôs not necessarily that I get a new perspective on the situation but sometimes tripping makes it easier to cry. Like I‚Äôve got all these feelings built up but after years of being told not to cry it‚Äôs physically difficult for me to cry a lot of the time even if I feel I need to. Psychedelics can break that barrier and allow me to release some of those emotions. I know that generally what I‚Äôm doing won‚Äôt harm me physically, but could I build some kind of perma-tolerance or will tolerance last longer if I this again?

Edit: thanks to all who replied! Sorry I didn‚Äôt really respond to any, I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get many responses and I got a little overwhelmed by all the comments.

One question will ask about your willingness to be contacted for a 30 - 60 minute online Teams interview or to come in person to take part in a group interview (focus group) of 5-10 people to further our understanding. We will not collect any information that can be used to identify you in the future, and any contact information we receive will not be linked to any of your survey responses.

2023-06-07 03:52:25,Visuals on magic mushrooms vs LSD,"Does LSD at ‚Äúnormal doses‚Äù give really visual experiences? 

How would you describe LSD visuals at 100 micrograms? 

Mind you I‚Äôve only taken half tabs (50 ug) and full tabs (100 ug) most of the time. Those trips are intense thought wise, emotion wise, wonder wise, and beauty wise. But they‚Äôre light on the intense visuals. I do think I‚Äôve taken 2 tabs once (200 ug) and had cartoonish hallucinations and sometimes tapestry like patterns. However, usually on 1 tab of LSD I find the visual experience mostly be a powerful brightening and detailing, some closed eye visuals. 

However, on psilocybin mushrooms (both verified Polka dot bars and also golden teachers strain) I can have visual hallucination effects on 1 gram or even .85 gram, low standard doses, maybe similar to 100 ug LSD. Tapestry like patterns usually and closed eyed some DMT like swirly visual rooms too. I trip out when I look at peoples faces, grass, or art. There are actual patterns and some hallucination quality. It‚Äôs much much more visual! The traditional psychedelic understanding of patterned visuals. 

Do you agree or disagree? 

Not important but the reason I ask is because I often introduce friends to the world of psychs through LSD as I feel it‚Äôs cleaner and much less nausea. Don‚Äôt love that it lasts 9/10 hours. But, the tripping on LSD is much more of a mind adventure experience for us‚Äîas well as emotions‚Äîversus a deeply visual experience.

2023-06-06 22:55:22,Does Memphis Tn have forgeable mushrooms(or 2c's)? Any hints or tips to aid in the venture? (addiction recovery),"(((I made a similar post yesterday but couldn't respond due to being at work))quick edit:::: are redditors DM-ing me legit or scammers?:::::::

Some details: 
I'm a Memphis local ( technically 20 minutes north in a small town called Millington) 

I have treatment resistant OCD, and after getting desperate I came across a research study that had amazing results in rapid OCD remission . Basically a combo is given to the patient consisting of SSRIs paired with opioids . I can 100% say it worked... I went from being completely mentally crippled were death would be a kindness to being a complete functioning human that for the first time in their life they felt that life was finally worth it, not stuck in a hopeless cycle of intrusive thoughts and rituals . 
But I'm sure you can see the future flaw....... opioids and self medication will end at rock bottom 

I'm finally in recovery from opiates, but with each passing day I can just feel in my heart that I'm just on borrowed time before my OCD comes back from remission . In more afraid that it will come back stronger with more devastation because I know mentally that opioids can fix it..... But that fix isn't a fix . 

I've read about psychedelics and the positive case studies showing that psychedelics can help create new pathways through neuroplasticity and actually help an addict move past their addiction. And because the opioid receptors and OCD itself work in similar parts of the brain one might be able to treat the OCD the same way the psychedelics are for the addiction. 

LOL there is definitely some irony in a self-medicating addict wanting to be clean by self-medicating again, but psychedelics aren't exactly addictive in the first place but I've got to try. 

The OCD is so crippling that death itself would be a kindness , and I just CAN'T go back to living with it. It's just not worth it...... 

So any tips on how, where to forage for mushrooms? I'm sightly familiar with the cow pasture path but even then I'm not exactly sure what to do..... 
I've also heard good things about addiction and 2cb..... How would one find 2cb in the Memphis wildernesses?",112,2137,18,374,1

2023-06-06 22:10:59,Looking for insight on what i think was an ego death experience.,"  

About 2 years ago, I stumbled upon various teachings, books and podcasts regarding meditation, spirituality without religion, mindfulness, transcending the self etc. Over the course of a year or so, I spent the majority of my free time outside of work and being a father just diving into this field of study and trying to learn as much as I can. While saying I have learned a lot, I can also say that a lot of it seems to be something that the mind can‚Äôt comprehend and it has to be an experienced type of learning. A lot of the knowledge on this topic that I have accumulated has become very useful in my everyday life- how I interact with the world and myself.  

Cut to about 1.5 years since stumbling on this topic, a friend of mine suggested I try magic mushrooms for the first time. Mind you, I have never taken any drugs and the first time I ever smoked weed was only 2 years prior to this. But, through the new knowledge I learned that when life presents an opportunity, you should take it. 

I had it all planned out - On Saturday, my friend and I were going to take these Mushrooms for the first time together. We were going to take 1 gram each and enjoy the ride. I did a lot of reading leading up about how to approach the experience, how much to do, what not to do etc. Saturday rolled around, and once our kids went to sleep (Our wives were home, sober lol) he was going to come over and we were going to indulge. About 10 minutes before he was supposed to come to my house, he called and had to cancel last minute as his wife hurt her back. This could have been an excuse due to nerves as neither of us had experimented with psychedelics before. 

I decided that I was going to take them anyway, by myself. I told my wife that I wanted to do this anyway because I wanted to get a glimpse of what it truly feels like to be present ( from what I have read, this is a common symptom ). 

So, I take the 1gram at 8pm, its kicking in around 9 and I'm having the time of my life. I went for a walk for about an hour and a half (felt like 6 hours lol) and I felt connected to everything living. Trees, bushes, grass, the sky - anything that was not man made fascinated me and I felt as though everything was the same and connected in some way. I made my way back to my house and while very noticeably coming down, I explained my experience from what I could recall to my wife. 

I had a pack of pre rolled joints and I had a thought that if I smoked some weed, that same high would return for longer. Well, that‚Äôs where it really took me for a ride.

I sat in my backyard, smoked about half this joint. As I was smoking it, I noticed that a thought popped into my head about a car payment I had coming Monday and how I had to make sure it came out of my account as the last one didn't for some reason. As soon as that thought came into my head, I thought ‚ÄúWhere did that come from? ‚Äú As soon as I thought where it came from, I heard a bird and the wind and a neighbor talking outside. All while noticing these sounds I was hearing, simultaneously I felt as though I was inside my head still looking for where that thought came from. 

Then it was like rapid fire. One after another, thoughts were popping in my head about my life. My wife, my kids, my job, my friends, my parents - everything I knew about my life was popping into my mind and while it would come into my mind, it was as if my brain automatically pushed it out just as fast and I felt as if I was noticing that these thoughts were coming from somewhere that was in my brain but not me doing it. I then realized it was my ego and I remembered what I had learned from books and teachings. As soon as I realized it was my ego, something inside my head just said ‚ÄúWhat else you got? The ego is really working hard here to get you to stay still ‚Äúand then, the most intensely uncomfortable feeling came over me. I started almost squirming slightly in my chair but I couldn't get up, and I remember thinking why I am so uncomfortable right now. I closed my eyes and then all of a sudden it felt as if every single cell in my body was vibrating on a level I can‚Äôt even describe. My body felt as if it was on fire but with a pleasurable feeling. It made me sink into my chair, I still get chills thinking about that feeling. 

I had a bit of a panic feeling after and I stood up rather quickly, feeling confused. When I looked at the stuff in my backyard, my house and my car - I felt as if none of it meant anything to me anymore. I had this vision of my computer at work and the screens were blurry, I couldn't make it out but I knew it was my office. I started to get scared that I was stuck this way forever that if nothing means anything then why am I even here? Did I just ruin my life with this experience, accidentally? It was an experience I read about and something I did want, but I suddenly felt regret for doing this to myself and here I am not permanently stuck seeing everything this way. It was a good and bad feeling almost. It felt good to have no connection to such material items but I felt sad and scared for my children now that their father was stuck seeing the world this way. I felt as if I couldn‚Äôt continue to provide for them as I could not see myself being able to perform at work when I have absolutely no interest, not to mention everything seemed blurred that had no significance to the true state of being. It felt like I had lost my job, my possessions, and pretty much everything I thought my life was. 

I went inside, and when I seen my wife on the couch she was almost glowing. Everything in the house was distorted, she kept asking me if I was having a hard time seeing because I was confused and looking around my house trying to re-attach my life to what I have been so accustomed to for so long, but I couldn‚Äôt find any feeling or meaning to anything I was looking at other than her. She looked radiant, I then had this feeling come over me and something in my head said love is what matters and when I looked at her, I felt that body vibration again. I felt as her and what she was feeling it seemed. I felt as though as long as she was happy, I am happy but not in a serving kind of way ‚Äì in a way that we were connected together as one. When I thought about my kids, my body would vibrate again. 

My son, who was almost 3, woke up and came out to the living room so one of us could come tuck him back in as he did most nights. The second I saw him walk out rubbing his eyes, my entire body felt at peace. I felt like nothing could disturb how I felt in that moment looking at him. Without hesitation, I picked him up and carried him back to his room. I stood there for however long just holding him and enjoying the feeling of his arms around my neck and I felt such an overwhelming sense of love, it feels impossible to articulate into words. Once I laid him back down, I left the room and instantly had feelings of panic again thinking how I can be their father and guide them when I‚Äôm not me anymore. I felt like I had lost my sense of who I was entirely, that was a terrifying feeling but graceful at the same time. 

I was trying to explain to my wife what just happened to me outside, but I couldn't find any words to describe it. I still can barely explain what I experienced. Even writing this out, it‚Äôs a fraction of what I experience that night in that chair. Not to mention, it felt as though that process explained above was hours but the joint I had in my hand was still burning just passed the halfway point, so it couldn't have been more than 5 minutes. 

Every time I would try and tell her how I'm feeling about work, our house, or whatever - I would suddenly feel as though I was going to throw up. I would walk away to the other room, sit down, and collect myself. I would try and go talk to her again about what I‚Äôm experiencing and then feel sick again. I was trying to tell her how scared I was that I'm changed forever, that I cant go to work because I don't feel its importance, I was scared that I would be changed as a father and it would affect my children. But every time I felt these worries, I would want to puke. 

I would hear the voice in my head that we all hear but it was so quiet that I would literally have to stop and focus on it to hear it. I felt as if I knew the answer to all my questions without actually knowing how to articulate the answer, if that makes any sense.

At one point, I felt so incredibly hungry all of a sudden. I went to my kitchen and thought about the left over pizza in my fridge and immediately thought of it made me feel sick. I then looked at the bananas hanging off our fruit rack and they have never looked so appealing. I ate 2 bananas back to back and they tasted as if I just tried solid food for the first time in my life. Back to the point I made of knowing the answers to my questions without articulating, I felt this weird knowing of food. I felt like almost everything in my house should not be consumed by humans but the kiwis, bananas, oranges, apples and peaches I seen on my counter seemed radiant and I could have eaten every last one.

I asked my wife to leave me be in the bedroom for a while so I could try and collect myself and figure out why I was going through this. After about an hour or 2, I felt myself back to normal, slowly but surely. I immediately picked up one of my books where they discuss Ego Death or Dissolution of the ego. I read that section and realized I may have experienced ego death.

The next day, I felt grateful for the experience but also felt notably ‚Äúoff‚Äù. I went to Walmart and I felt like everyone in there was under a spell and I had just witnessed what we are supposed to truly feel like. It was still a little scary because I thought to myself ‚ÄúOkay so I can still do what I need to do, but now I feel like it is a waste of my time‚Äù. As the weeks went on, I fell back into feeling as I always have. I still continue my journey through meditation, reading as many books as I can get my hands on and I‚Äôm currently seeking out a retreat to meet like-minded individuals on the same journey.

To this day, I still get the knot in my stomach and the chills in my spine when I think about what I felt and experienced in that chair that night. It will changed my life, what I think about my life and what all this is about. The excitement for me is in the journey. I am having a blast exploring what is unknown territory to me and trying to navigate my way through. I‚Äôm not concerned with what is considered the pinnacle of all this. I am just grateful life put this subject in front of me and grateful this is something that I am experiencing in this life. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel like this ‚Äúego death‚Äù experience was laid out for me specifically. I felt this during as well. After 1-2 years of personal research and fascination in this topic. I was handed these mushrooms out of the blue, I had plans with a friend who cancelled last minute, and I got to enjoy 3 hours of a nice normal mushroom trip only to end the night with the experience I have laid out today. It felt as though the universe conspired to put everything in line for me to experience this along my journey. It felt like it was supposed to happen for me, not to me. 

Even though I am grateful for the experience and it was life changing, I have been left with some confusion and a lot of wonder.

Why was I struggling, why did it feel like I was coming in and out of my life? Why was I so uncomfortable yet feeling complete ease and bliss in my body all at the same time? How come others who have this experience describe it as a ‚Äúbreak from life‚Äù? I felt as if I was fighting myself, like I was not letting the ego go and every time I would try to accept that it happened, I would feel sick to my stomach. I know I was afraid that I had lost myself but I also wanted to let it all go and see what happened ‚Äì unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt do it for some reason.

I guess I'm just trying to understand the experience and wonder if I wasn't doing something I should have in that moment to fully escape my ego.",64,12102,12,2398,1

2023-06-06 20:57:29,Psychedelic Retreats - Affordable Alternatives?,"Have been reading a lot about retreats that have a therapeutic focus and utilise psychedelic substances to help induce states of vulnerability and openness otherwise out of reach for the individuals involved. Feels like the well-respected retreats are doing good work based on how they facilitate your trip, help you integrate your experience with your 'normal' conscious self, and be helpful guides for your healing journey.

I have been microdosing psilocybin for the last month and noticing positive results in overall outlook and general insight into how my thought processes work and where a lot of my trauma stems from. I haven't done any macro doses but I'm interested to experiment.

My questions:

- How much healing do you feel microdosing psilocybin can offer? What are your experiences?

- If macrodosing, what do you feel are important elements in order to help nurture and encourage your own journey towards healing and growth? e.g. alone vs in a group, needing a trained or experienced mentor with you, how soon after an experience is it important to discuss your experience to help integrate what you've learnt?

- Psychedelic retreats are all vastly unaffordable for most people. Are there any ways in which you can facilitate your own version for much less money? Or are there any affordable and reputable alternatives out there that you know of? I'm from the UK.",47,1381,5,228,1

First day I had 2.5g of damiana in a tea. I had a cold and had a fever the night before, the tea helped the cold symptoms and gave me a slight mood boost with a little stimulation. Next day I smoked a small amount, little mood boost/stimulation, little increase in color saturation maybe, then couple hours later I crashed, little nausea too. Not sure if the side effects were related or lingering cold symptoms.

Anyway, both days after I've had a weird headspace, interconnectedness to the universe, that almost de ja vue feeling, and just that psych perception change that I can't put into words, things just look/feel different.

2023-06-06 15:04:55,Is there anything that all psychonauts have seen?,"You know that mysterious ""s"" that kids used to draw in the 90's.00's?

Idk...that experience is far to grand and full for there not to be something someone else has also seen.

For example, if you took x amount of grams and started seeing falling light or plants growing in your carpet, what if someone else has seen that very same thing? I know that people resopond differently to the substance based on their emotional state, stress levels, preconceived ideas about the matter, location upon ingestion, etc... but I still have this theory that just as the roots of trees are touching underground, even though they're far away, I think that our experiences are roots, different and same roads that all lead to everywhere. So shouldn't there be common sights, sounds, words and so on? I don't know. Maybe it's a reach but I think it's real. Plausible at the very least.

2023-06-06 13:30:03,Experiencing one‚Äôs own manhood on shrooms,"I wonder what people‚Äôs experiences with this are. Womanhood as well. I tripped a couple weeks ago with a group, mostly women. It wasn‚Äôt interactive, we were each doing our own thing.

I felt a very strong sense of my own manhood and my experience and attitude as a man informed by millions of years of evolution. It was a good, strong inner feeling. I had lots of energy (seemingly unlike my companions) and the urge to face a big undertaking. I also wanted to interact with the earth. I went to a waterfall and loved the water and I also imagined being enveloped in cool, dry soil. I was conscious of my hands and their use as tools as well as my stance and its embodiment of an attitude. I thought about the kind of man I am, or would be in a more primal context, and about the experiences in my life that made me strong and made my brain develop.

Because masculinity is something I think about and which motivates my actions I wondered before the trip if the veil would come down, or if I‚Äôd see what I‚Äôve been suppressing. This didn‚Äôt happen. Part of me wants it to happen to allow myself to experience emotion more fully and another does not want it all to be revealed as an illusion, which I don‚Äôt believe it is, at least entirely.

Psychedelics, when I could confidently do them, were some of the most magical moments of my life, ones that I'll never forget, but all it took was one trip for the dominoes to fall.

I'm disappointed to have come to this realization. I wish I could join those of you experiencing the otherwordly with open arms, take flight, and ascend to bliss unimaginable.

2023-06-05 16:31:56,Bizarre Entity Experience on PE,"Hi everyone! I made this account specifically to make this post as I need some answers from the \*ahem\* experienced members of this community. I am sorry for the long post, but this was a highly eventful experience.

I (23f) took shrooms for the first time with my BF (25m) while in the company of some friends 2 months ago.

I have been undergoing a massive healing journey these past few years following some highly traumatic events in 2018. I had managed to get through each day in denial of what had occured, but the pandemic forced me inside and forced me to think critically about what I've gone through. It was ugly, but 3 years later I feel as though I've come out the other end.

We had it planned out. My boyfriend and I were going to take 1.5g for our first time tripping, and our 2 friends (another couple who we are very good friends with) were going to stay sober to guide us. The plan was to take the shrooms and go to a local park that those of us that were tripping had never been to.

So it's the morning of, we're about to leave for the park and we weighed out 1.5 grams for each of us to take. We ground our servings into a powder and dumped each serving into it's own shot glass, then filled each glass to the top with orange juice. We let it sit for about 30 seconds before downing the entire shot in one disgusting, citrusy gulp. Neither of us seemed to be too concerned with the fact that we had only had a single dunkin donut each to eat that day. The plan is to leave immediately after as the place is 30 minutes from their apartment, but we were still there after 15 minutes. We decided it was time to dip but I had to use the bathroom really quickly. This is when it started.

The walls of the bathroom in front of me, or more specifically, the texture of the walls began to move in a fluid motion. I looked at the floor, and the grain of the wood slabs moved like a rushing river that disapppeared under the bathroom door and poured into the room on the other side. The only thing I could think in that moment was ""Fuck.""

I left the bathroom in a hurry, told my friends it was starting, and they all recommended we leave immediately. I also learned that while I was in the bathroom, my boyfriend got sick and threw up all the shrooms he took :(

By the time we got to the car (a 30-second walk), I felt incredibly disoriented. It felt like the Earth was closing in on me and weighing on my body, but almost in an energetic sense rather than literal? I put on my sunglasses and got in the car with my boyfriend in the backseat and our two friends in the front.

This car ride felt like hell. I felt nauseous and I felt this intense sensation of being overpowered completely. I could feel my eyelids become 100 pounds heavier, but this voice in my brain that I recognized as my own said KEEP THEM OPEN. The only problem was that I couldn't. Everywhere I looked, I felt like I was being blinded. Lights were extremely bright and hurt my eyes, so I gave in and shut them hard.

As I shut them, I saw geometric shapes, patterns, the usual stuff that gets discussed in this thread. What I was not expecting was to suddenly lose all sensation in my body. I shit you not, I felt like I was aimlessly floating through...space? Time? I was completely untethered and it terrified me. Then, the feeling of aimlessness ceases. As I look up, I see why. Before me stood a woman who was, simply put, the most mesmerizing woman I had ever seen. She was COSMICALLY large (she could probably hold the moon like a soccer ball, for reference), with olive skin and very dark brown wavy hair that flowed in all directions. As I gazed upon her, I began to register more details about her appearance, and I gained this sense that she was the essence of everything that exists. It was terrifying and beautiful to experience. Just to remind you all, this is happening as I am sitting in the car with 4 people at 1pm with my eyes closed. I am seeing this in my mind's eye.

The woman and I spoke but there are bits and pieces I cannot recall. She asked me to let go. I said how?? of what?? I cannot let go of myself, it's who I am. She said ""let me show you who you are"".

I saw a few flashing images of things I did not recognize, but what I could recognize were the flashing images of 6 or so women, who appeared to come from many different periods in time. I intuitively felt that I had a strong direct connection to these women, but I could not fully determine whether they were ancestral representations or past-life ones. Then, she literally GREW my body until I was the same size as her. I can still recall the feeling of my body stretching and pulling itself in all directions to match hers, and we stood together with the planet Earth in between us. I was HUGE. Then, in a split second, she shrunk my body down to the size of an atom. The feeling of snapping back into myself was intense as hell. I became so shrunken down that I found myself inside of the cellular structure of a mushroom. This appeared as a massive network of tunnels that connected to each other and never seemed to end, and I was just FALLING THROUGH IT. I remember being terrified, having no control, desperately trying to grab onto something but I was so small that I never once touched any part of my surroundings. Then the falling stopped, and I was in the woman's embrace, and the love I felt was so intense and surreal it brought tears to my eyes. It was a new and unfamiliar feeling of contentness, completeness, forgiveness, and unconditional love.

I felt everything begin to move around me, and I do mean EVERYTHING. Everything that has ever existed or will ever exist. The woman then looked at me, and said that by letting go, I open myself up to everything the world has to offer. Then, in a way that sounded louder and more direct than our previous conversation, she said ""Just watch."" I then opened my eyes to find that we had just parked at our destination, and that everything became overwhelmingly serene and quiet from one second to the next. I immediately got out of the car to throw up because, let's face it, the sensation of falling through an abyss can make you feel a little sick. I did not throw up. The entire first hour of the trip was me trying to reason with the universe so that this sick feeling would pass. I felt like something was trying to claw it's way out of me. It wasn't until the other girl we were with asked me what I was feeling, heard me out, and replied ""Just let go"" that the feeling went away. I then proceeded to have an amazing trip out in nature, the remainder of which was not out of the ordinary apart from extreme visuals and everything (the field, the trees, the lake) all looking like they were alive.

It is my understanding that this is not a common trip experience, especially on 1.5 g. Every report of contact with an entity that I have seen has been on 3g or higher. Has anyone had an experience like this on shrooms? Everyone in my life that I've talked to has either been floored by my experience or flat-out does not believe me. The only person who told me that they had a similar experience was someone who used Ayahuasca. This was a beautiful journey that 100% changed my life for the better, but it's difficult when you can't find others that have had a similar experience.",31,7322,5,1384,1

2023-06-06 00:36:52,Bad Trip : The Realm of Spiders,"Apart from an ""accidental"" lad trip that ended with me running out of my shoes down town, climbing a Ferrari and then immediately beging shuttled off of it ass the driver got inside and drove away with quick acceleration allowing me to me the floor.

I took DMT years after that and since both trips I now just have an overlay world that sprouts through my ""current reality"". I call it the shadow realms, the spider realm, the sword of the spider queen even though spiders have no queen out side of Arachne (Greek myth)

Any how I was wondering two things:
A - has anyone experience the spider realm
B- if you have do you experience it on all senses except for physical touch? This is how I experience it. 4 senses out of 5.

My experience in this alternate state is reality being abruptly intruded by spiders of all types and of all sizes crawling on me, this ones cause a panic attack (truly it was the amount of caffeine I had that day, but it didn't help)

It may help to note that these experiences are now brought up on me when I smoke THC or any form consumption of it. Usually almost any alternative ""consciousness"".

Anyhow, it's like a giant space spider or galactic tarantula or like phantasmal spider just waltz's in to my mind's eye but also my regular vision but a it spike an over lat were the transparency level is like 10% spider and 90% reality.  It never ventures beyond 20% unless I close my eyes then is all hands on deck.

Now to hear a spider.... It's ehhh 30/70 with 70 been a no but seeing them on me or on the walls is a bit problematic. How ever it has helped me conquer my fear of spiders and giving me more concern with how I .....treat them.

If I seem like I'm tripping at all just ignore me and slide on endlessly.",31,1746,7,331,1

I have Starlink internet so staying connected with friends via internet/phone should not be an issue I also have a bike for excersise as well as if an emergency comes up and I need to evac. On board SWIM will have a lot of DMT, Shrooms and LSD. 

The reason I am making this post is because I am looking for suggestions on how to fill my day and what I should focus on.  I'll be coming down the mountain about once a week to get food/water and any supplies needed but other than that I dont have any friends in Colorado that I'm aware of well except 1 guy but I think he travels alot for work.  Will I go insane with the solitude? How often should I trip? I was thinking about having a steady drip off the DMT vape pen while hiking daily and about once a week tripping on shrooms or lsd.  Again I'm not sure what I'm making this post for other than to get some ideas from the folks here on my focus.  If you think this is a bad idea let me know that too. I just want input. Thanks.

Also to reiterate I will be doing this Solo, I've lived in an RV for awhile but a lot of the time I am visiting friends around the country or interacting with people at local events. This will be the first time I go Solo in the mountains for multiple months at a time.",40,1497,7,303,1

2023-06-05 22:56:48,Placebo pill for a tripkiller?,"Hi, I had this thought, do you think a placebo pill would work as a trip killer if someone is having a rough time?

Since tripping is such a psychological event, anything external could influence your journey like music, lighting, a sound, then maybe if someone is going through a bad trip, the trip sitter could have the tripper take a placebo pill and make him believe everything is going to be fine now, maybe he would get into a much more positive and relaxed headspace.

I've heard that a benzo still takes time to act as a tripkiller so, maybe best to try with a placebo before hand. I also am of the opinion that a benzo tripkiller can be counterproductive since what makes a ""good"" trip in the end, was the very challenging moments, sometimes so overwhelming that you wish it stopped right there, but if you endure it, you'll feel grateful and so rewarded by the tough teachings.

What do you think? Have you tried this? Any experiences with placebos? Curious about it!

2023-06-05 21:44:00,Sleep Paralysis confirmed for me that Tripping is NOT Hallucinating,"There‚Äôs some overlap but they aren‚Äôt the same. 

Last night my sleep schedule was off because I moved to a new place and I also took a nap earlier that day. (Inconsistent sleeping patterns apparently induce Sleep Paralysis.$

It was 3am and I was trying to sleep. I was still awake but would hear creepy voices, my girlfriends dog etc. This was a full on hallucination. I heard the dogs footsteps with crystal clear clarity and my visual perspective was just normal falling asleep / closed eyes / dark. I tried to look for the dog but couldn‚Äôt move because my body was in paralysis. 

Tripping isn‚Äôt ‚Äúseeing things that aren‚Äôt there‚Äù. It‚Äôs this mesh / overlay / different perception of reality. It‚Äôs a subjective experience to each individual and describing it is very difficult. Yes things that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù appear in a trip, but it‚Äôs typically obvious it‚Äôs perceived from your brain rather than you being convinced it actually exists.

I‚Äôm not trying to gate keep the psychedelic experience but ‚Äútrue‚Äù hallucinations seem to be dangerous where as tripping is not. If you see a car speeding toward you that isn‚Äôt there, that is a hallucination. If you interpret clouds to be breathing in a majestic manner then youre tripping. 

If there was a Venn diagram between tripping and hallucinating, you‚Äôd be much closer to crossover section on DMT or higher doses of mushrooms. Even then, it‚Äôs arguably not a true hallucination. 

Anyways just a random subjective experience and analysis I had. Wish society didn‚Äôt paint a stigma on psychedelics as hallucinations as it‚Äôs very different.",67,1583,10,267,1

2023-06-05 19:26:46,Trip Report First Time 5-MeO,"**Trip Report First Time 5-MeO**

**Background:**

It might help you to understand what type of person I am.  I‚Äôm 33 years old, I‚Äôve worked in corporate for 11 years, 9 of them being an engineer.  I am very skeptical, formerly christian, and would consider myself a ‚Äúwho really knows what is out there‚Äù agnostic.  You won‚Äôt find me talking in woo woo or in spiritual terms, and I often poke fun at those who do (I guess until this experience).   

I did zero drugs until I was 28 years old (except alcohol).  I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy being in trip states, so you won‚Äôt find me doing psychedelics day after day unless I‚Äôm on some sort of beach trip or camping trip dedicated to doing so.  I find accomplishment in life in both work, personal goals, and hobbies to be satisfying.  I am also a fitness person.  So for any corporate professionals out there, you may be similar to me and can relate. 

**Psychedelic History:**

No drug use until 2017.  Started with weed a few times a week but over months that quickly reduced down to once a week.  Mushrooms started at once a year, then in 2021, I started using mushrooms 1x per month sometimes twice.  Mostly 2g, a few times were 3g, and a few times 5g.  

In 2022, I started trying out DMT, but avoided it for a while because I thought it had lead to some worsening tinnitus (than I already had).  That subsided mostly.  In 2023 I started doing 1 tab of LSD every few months, I think they are \~100ug.  Overall I prefer LSD, but dabble in mushrooms whenever I feel called.  

I‚Äôve also done MDMA, but in very carefully measured doses and 5-6 months apart.  I mixed it with nothing and am careful to not overdo it there. 

**DMT History**

I started DMT with MintyLove‚Äôs videos on Emesh.  I put lots of effort into tuning the device, but ultimately didn‚Äôt know some of the nuance, so I usually burned or didn‚Äôt vaporize the DMT fully.  One time I got in 20mg+ and it was wild as you‚Äôd expect.  I did it 4-5 times early 2022 and a few times later in early 2023 when I worked with my friend to optimize the technique and settings.  So again, I share this to let you know I‚Äôm not a daily user or even weekly, not even close.  I may do it more after this whole experience. 

**5-MeO**

I had not really thought about doing 5-MeO but was super curious about it after having tried DMT.  I had listened to accounts from Joe Rogan and such of how much more intense it was.  I also would read other accounts of 5-MeO which peaked my curiosity.  In early 2023, it started ‚Äòcalling out‚Äô to me (I know it sounds weird).  I told this to a friend that I had made (over Emesh tinkering) and he mentioned he could come out and administer it so that I could have the experience.  I thought about it for a few months and agreed mostly because he seemed to know what he was doing, had tons of safety precautions, and seemed like he wanted to make sure the set and setting I enter into this with would be well thought out and calm.  He had experience administering this before, so it‚Äôs not as if we were just bros doing this in our basement. 

**Method for 5-MeO:**

Emesh.  Dose fully vaporized and inhaled.  Held in for 10s or more.  

We did a handshake method, starting with a intro super low dose 1.25mg, then a low dose 2.5mg, medium dose 5mg, and then the full breakthrough attempt at 10mg.  I also thought that I had broken through on the 10mg until I did the 11mg (detailed below) which was a very different and full experience, which suggested I hadn‚Äôt fully broken through on the 10mg!

**My Loose Intention:** 

Again, I‚Äôm not all woo woo.  I don‚Äôt subscribe fully to deep childhood trauma causing issues in adulthood, but I‚Äôm open to its possibilities. Also, throughout my 20‚Äôs, I noticed how hateful I am as a person.  My loose intention was to understand and let go of that hate, or at least understand it better or where it came from.  As you‚Äôll read below I think some of that occurred before my breakthrough dose. 

Here are my best notes on my experience:

**1.25mg - Super Low Intro Dose**

Upon onset, I had a very very mild and vague ‚Äòfeel good‚Äô feeling in the body.  I was expecting something more powerful.  Other people in the room were wow‚Äôd by the dosage but I found it more to be a super chill and easy way to get into a meditative state.  It calmed me down.  I left the experience going ‚Äúok that was nice, I like this stuff.‚Äù  I also felt that it was possible that I overhyped the molecule in the weeks leading up to the trip (I was wrong). 

**2.5mg - Low Dose**

This experience was much like some of my sub 10mg DMT trips but there was a lot more black space in the visuals. It was powerful, I felt energy in my body and the body started to fade which gave me a sneak preview into the disembodiment.  I saw lots of color, which I was told isn‚Äôt common.  The color was more isolated like the visuals were self contained with lots of black space in between.  I was wearing an eye mask so I imagine that had something to do with the blackness.  Overall it was, again, very powerful! I was definitely surprised and had realized this molecule is no joke.  I left this dose feeling ‚Äúoh. my. god. How is this the low dose!!‚Äù

**5mg - medium dose**

I don‚Äôt remember much from this dosage because it was overpowered by the large dosages.  I felt this immense energy but I was definitely mostly intact in terms of my ego because I distinctly remember thinking at the peak ‚Äòholy cow this is too much‚Äô. Being able to think that and understand what was happening to my consciousness leads me to believe my memories were fully there and able to evaluate the experience.  

I saw white, with what seems to be color bleeding through in a grid form.  The energy was very intense and borderline unsettling to me, almost like it was too much and this is where 5-MeO really set itself apart from the DMT that I had done infrequently in the past.  There was not much sense of my body at this dosage, but the entire time I could talk if I wanted to and think up words.  When it came on, I remember being so shocked, awed, and astonished by all of the pure energy that was surging through my consciousness and any faint sensation of having a body - as my body came close to melting away, I did let out some sadness in the form of whimper, as I am sure my ego felt what could be coming as I approached more of this disembodiment.  

On the way back, I remember being so touched by the intense energy in the form of intense love that I felt.  I felt very sorry and remorseful, but for nothing in particular.  I remember thinking ‚Äúhow could I?‚Äù and I think this is my true mind being allowed to be open without being shadowed by the strong ego. I also spoke out and remember feeling and commenting on ‚Äúhow much love I had‚Äù because I think I was approaching becoming the intense love energy that I was feeling and I naturally identified with that.  I reflected on things as they popped up in my mind on the way down from the peak, mostly thinking about others and how thankful, happy, and sorry I was towards all of them.  I also clearly understood how concerned with others I always am and have been, so I was able to self reflect on those types of thoughts that came up.  There was definitely some strong euphoria.  But the dose also brought me to tears and left me in a deep appreciative and open state.  I gave hugs to everyone in the room upon returning from this journey.  

I left this dose feeling ‚Äúhow in the world does it get more intense or different than that? This is the medium dose?!‚Äù

**10mg - full breakthrough dose attempt**

This trip was done with my gf next to me as I was very nervous.  It‚Äôs common, for me, in trips on DMT that when I lose sense of my body in space or my body in time, that I call out to see if ‚Äúanyone is there.‚Äù  During these episodes, I can fully remember my gf is around, as she is usually there sitting with me and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù  This lets me know that I‚Äôm still connected with my actual body (I can hear) and allows my mind to relax and enjoy the experience more because I get a sense of not going too deep.  The feeling of going to deep gives me the feeling of getting lost in the DMT realm or whatever you call it.  

So I took the dose and for the first few minutes, it didn‚Äôt matter if I was calling out, because I had little memory of how to do so.  The energy was so immense and powerful, I couldn‚Äôt believe it.  I viscerally spoke out ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù in a humbled tone as I could not believe what I was experiencing.  However, Within minutes of‚Ä¶earth time, I asked out where I was and if anyone was there.  My gf responded and this comfort allowed me to sink further into the experience.  At the peak, for the first few minutes, there was nothing but a very light pastel colors, mostly oranges, reds, and peaches, at some points swirling together in a very slow moving liquid.  There was no edge to my visual field that I could tell.  There was no up and down, right and left, and the verbal ‚Äòoh my god‚Äô was coming from the fact that I was experiencing this place as myself but with a mix of my memory of why I was there.  

My gf continually let me know that I was ok and to relax, etc, which allowed me to be more in the experience, but in a tethered way.  My body seemed completely gone (days later I‚Äôd find out in my breakthrough dose that it wasn‚Äôt), and I could only really feel the expressions on my face as I moved through intense waves of sadness, astonishment, and the edge of disintegration.  On the way down the visuals changed from swirling, water-like colors to a new scene which was this weird crystal place. 

The crystal place was not a room of crystals that I could observe.  It was a crystal existence.  My entire vision was covered in shades of black, green, red, blue, purple, just like the colors that would reflect when looking at a diamond.  The crystals were clear and the vision of them was 90% vivid.  I stayed in this place for a few minutes, and while my gf spoke a few times, and I responded, still not feeling my body - I did feel something very weird.  I was ‚Äòfacing‚Äô directly at a long crystal about the size of a doorway in my visual field.  However, I wasn‚Äôt observing this crystal, I embodied it.  My only body sensation was to feel like the size and shape of this crystal in front of me.  The crystal, that was me, was not floating in empty space, it was embedded in tons of other crystal material.  It was very odd how much I enjoyed this place and it seemed to last a very long time.  It was calm and peaceful, coming with some moderate euphoria. 

As I left the crystal place and state, I then descended lower and lower to my body.  It had been close to 20 minutes at this point with lots of visuals like the medium doses filling up my visual field.  I felt tons of love and very little of the ego that made up my life on earth.  I also felt tons of awe that brought me to tears on what I had just experienced as well as some remorse for things I had done, but not anything specific.  The remorse was paired with a feeling of ‚Äúhow could I?‚Äù Again, I can‚Äôt pinpoint what it was.  If I stayed still at like 18-20 minutes, I would be able to ‚Äòkeep‚Äô this body-free state where I was just a mind descending back to my body.  It felt very pleasant and it is the relaxation that I can tap into in the days after.  Eventually I became very aware of sounds in the room, would inquire about them to my gf while keeping my eyes closed, but I was also taking my time up to 25-30 minutes before I started moving in place of laying down. I took my time which I think was key for the experience. 

Later on my friend wished he would have given me a bit more because it appeared that while I slightly broke through, I was still able to talk and reference back to the real world.  At the time I didn‚Äôt think much of it and felt like I had the ‚Äòfull‚Äô experience.  36 hours later, I didn‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôd get the full experience, below. 

**11mg - full breakthrough dose**

The previous doses were on Saturday evening, this dose was on Memorial Day around 12pm.  My gf redid her high dose as she didn‚Äôt inhale all of it, while I agreed at first that I‚Äôd do a medium dose.  She had such a great breakthrough with her high dose, that I figured I‚Äôd do between a medium and a high dose.  So 8mg. Then I upped it to 9mg.   I thought on it while my friend measured out everything and said ‚Äúno let‚Äôs do the full dose.‚Äù So 10mg.  So while I meditated to get ready and calm down for my high dose, my friend came over and said ‚Äúnow I wanted to make a suggestion if you‚Äôre open to it, to up the dose to 11mg, some people need a little more to really get there.‚Äù  I was very lucky my friend had experience administering this before and could sense the sub-breakthrough I had with 10mg on Saturday based off my feedback.  I decided to go through with it, especially since the night before, this friend and I discussed how maybe I should have done 1mg more on my breakthrough attempt (at 10mg) because it seemed like my breakthrough either wasn‚Äôt that long or didn‚Äôt fully happen because I could talk.  

So after doing some meditation and him guiding me on how to do nothing and let go during the experience, he loads up the emesh, and I‚Äôm very nervous and lots of surprising memories came to the surface.  Essentially, every single time I had been treated like I was nothing, what accomplishments I had that people showed me didn‚Äôt matter, and lots of traumatic scenes from my childhood and teenage years all bubbled up right to the surface of my awareness.  They felt like they were on the surface of my torso almost.  I started to get nauseous, something I didn‚Äôt feel at all with the lower doses. 

The Emesh was loaded, I did a \~16 second toke nice and steady, and I did not cough any out or try to choke it down.  It was perfect.   As I started to lay back on the yoga mat/stretch pad, I could feel myself going in before my head hit the pillow.  

It started as a metallic haze that I started to approach with my field of vision.  There were some lightly colored swoops, almost like moving fish scales moving in a sweeping pattern within each other.  My awareness approached and dived into these patterns and soon after I was in a state that felt like an eternity, it‚Äôs as if I had no memory - not in the traditional sense at least.  I was aware, but there was no ‚ÄòI‚Äô to be aware of in the place I was.  When I refer to ‚ÄúI‚Äù I am referring to the memories that make up my life on earth.

This dosage was so much more different than the 10mg experience because I was back in the astonished / awe state, but I had been there for so long that I couldn‚Äôt even think to speak out and ask how long I‚Äôd been there.   

At the suggestion of my friend, we talked about how my gf should not be next to me this time to talk me through it, but she sat on the couch and left me to do this journey by myself.  I think this was very important for me to have the experience I had because my friend mentioned sometimes that people do this with their partner/spouse and end up keeping a tether as they reach out or stay connected with their loved one.  The idea of doing it alone sounded good, and I decided it was what I wanted, and it turned out I needed it as I ended up having no tether to the real world.  

I was in a place that again, had light liquid swirls, but I could not remember what ‚ÄòI‚Äô was, why my awareness was this, that there even was an ‚ÄòI‚Äô, it was just pure love and emotion, so overwhelming and full of energy that I could almost not handle it.  As I felt like there was some part of me that was holding on, I let go in this place and became more of the place.  I was my awareness, I was what I was looking at.    


I did not call out during the first part as I couldn‚Äôt even think, but soon I was verbally, after 4-5 minutes in this state, saying the same ‚Äòoh my god‚Äô almost in a desperate (emotionally) state.  Desperate to comprehend existence without time or space.  I mustered to say ‚Äúthere is so much love‚Äù and ‚ÄúI have so much love,‚Äù because I felt a love so powerful that it couldn‚Äôt be human.  There was so much energy.  There was no memory of anything that had to do with ‚Äòme.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt remember work, my hobbies, anyone in my life, I didn‚Äôt even know *who* said ‚Äòyou‚Äôre ok‚Äô when my gf and friend said that in the room as they monitored me for safety.  I think I remember someone said ‚Äòlet go‚Äô or 'relax‚Äô, and when I did, I still cannot comprehend how completely I melted.  I could not comprehend this state and there wasn‚Äôt a fear of going there, but this overwhelming calmness that I can only liken to death (but not in a bad way).  The calmness almost drew me in, at the same time I borderline fought it, all while I was this place, all at the same moment.  

The place, full of color with light pastel swirls everywhere, like two liquids mixing together at various places.  I also vaguely remember rounded hexagons of different pastels that merged together, like very large pixels.   It was similar to the start of my 10mg dose, there was nothing there, no left/right, up down, there wasn‚Äôt anything behind me, I was everywhere.  As far as sounds, there was no particular sound that I could make out or recognize.  Any music that made it through was right there and I could not sense the distance or direction from where it came.  The same with the voices in the room from my friend and gf.  I couldn‚Äôt feel my body at all.  I could only feel the faint sensation of me swallowing, but I could not feel myself breathing in the slightest.  I didn‚Äôt even know if I was breathing or what breathing was. I didn‚Äôt think ‚Äúam I breathing?‚Äù This place was me and I was this place.  The place was filled with so much love and energy, I cannot describe it in any terms from where I‚Äôm writing now.

During the peak, there was music playing and at times I did not hear the music at all, I would hear parts of it, but it was very odd, I tried to hear what the music was that was playing but I couldn‚Äôt.  I couldn't make the progression of the time in the song at all to establish sequence in the parts of the song or even that it was a song playing, just that there was a pleasant sound that later I came to realize was the music playing the entire time.  The songs that played were almost chopped up, with large pieces missing as I was so overwhelmed with my attention to other parts of the place I was in.  This was no crystal place and as I started to slowly come back to my body, I could notice how slow the process was.  At this time I was clocking in about 20 minutes and I said out loud that I needed more time to relax into my body.  It was like a feather was floating down from space at 1mm per second and the true me floated down without anything from my past.  It was so gentle.  No hurt, no sorry, no regrets, just pure me was ‚Äòinstalled‚Äô into ‚Äòa body.‚Äô  It was a *wild* sensation.  I took my time, didn‚Äôt move, and was laying completely flat on the floor not moving the whole time.  

From the color I saw in the peak of the state, as I descended it was like a sunset, where the colors would change into different mixes, but these colors were also mixed with emotions that were free of the constraints of the ego.  I was so relaxed, and every time I let go more during the descent, I became more relaxed.  It was a pureness and bliss I can only describe as a sunset that I embodied, filled with love, hope, and the overwhelming feeling that ‚Äòit‚Äôs ok.‚Äô 

As I descended, I couldn‚Äôt feel my body unless I moved a bit.  I could not discern this process of coming back down to my body from what I would describe birth to be like, if you asked me to describe such a thing.  Yes, I became aware of the drug, and that I had taken it, and that it was wearing off, but all the parts of my mind that would start chattering, the ego part, was silenced during this decent.  It was beautiful.  My eyes were streaming out water at how much relief and beauty I felt.  The music at certain times had melancholy tones to it, which moved me to tears.  At those moments I remembered how much capacity my body and I guess ego has for this deep sadness and allowed myself to feel that.  These waves would pass and when I finally got back to my body, I felt like I had died and been reborn.  My gf, at this time came over from the couch she was sitting on 10ft away and sat next to me.  I opened my eyes and saw the ceiling fan and ceiling, in an indescribable peaceful state.  I hugged her, moved with emotion while my friend stepped out of the room.  When he came back I gave him a big hug in gratitude for helping me experience this insane and beautiful state of consciousness.  I sat and expressed what I typed now to the best of my ability.  

For 10-15 min after getting up, I was laughing for no reason whatsoever, I think it may have been at how incredible the entire experience was.  I was saying things like ‚Äúif that isn‚Äôt a breakthrough I don‚Äôt know what is!‚Äù  I reminisced on how much love, beauty, and power I felt in the place I was.  I tried to comprehend existence without time and space.  I also felt pride that I had accomplished this journey with the courage to inhale the right amount of this molecule.  I had done it, it did its work on me, I felt it.  I was excited to see where it‚Äôd take me in my day to day life. 

**Days after the breakthrough:**

The night after my 11mg breakthrough I woke up many times in the same ‚Äòplace‚Äô that I was in at the peak.  I didn‚Äôt feel time, or where I was.  My body was completely gone in my sleep and that sensation returned as I became aware and woke up multiple times in the night.  I was told by my friend that there could be ‚Äòreactivations‚Äô in the nights after the trip.  This happened 4-5 times throughout the first night.  It was slightly unsettling, but overall extremely peaceful and relaxing.  I was happy to be there, especially in my sleep.  I had never felt such a thing in my sleep.  I viewed it as positive because I could relax so well and sleep so deep.  However, I woke up groggy the next morning, possibly for other reasons like hydration and food. 

The next day I felt incapable of getting upset by anything.  I did my morning walk and when I walked by a bird, I could hear it chirping from the ‚Äòtop of my head.‚Äô Very odd! It was like I was meditating while walking and echolocating.   I felt I was missing some low level anxiety that I had always felt but didn‚Äôt know that was there.  It was like a pit in my stomach was sealed shut with goodness. Time will tell how this manifests in my life. 

48 hours the night after my trip, I still had many reactivations but they were less pronounced.  A few were in that ‚Äòplace‚Äô but mostly they were the body sensation that I felt.  Extreme relaxation, and almost like I didn‚Äôt have a body while I was coming up from my sleep. 

2 Days during the day after my trip, I again had lots of patience.  I felt like nothing could upset me, and I didn‚Äôt worry about anything that I‚Äôd usually give undue care to.  I felt open to people.  I felt a renewed hope.  Everything was as it is.   

72 hours the night after my trip, I had nice dreams, some were vivid, but not overly so.  

I write this 5 days after my trip and I still feel a lack of anxiety that I had before. I didn‚Äôt have high anxiety but I guess it was subtle.  My ego recovers every day but I am seeing its reactions so clearly it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt ignore it.  I catch myself building irritation, angst, and judgment towards things and others and I can choose to let it be separate from myself.  I don‚Äôt claim to be awakened, but I certainly feel different.  I hope to continue to be aware of my ego the best I can without being unified with it. 

**Recommendations**:

As I said before, I‚Äôm not a very spiritual person, but my friend knew what he was doing and burnt incense, used a scented water, and had us meditate with relaxing music.  Every dose took *very* long to measure with a high quality scale.  Safety was top priority, but so was going in with the right mindset.  I cannot imagine doing this molecule any other way.  The mindset I tried to achieve during these meditations was to just let go, to let it happen, and to be ok with whatever the experience ended up being.",28,24255,5,4619,1

I had no where near as much stomach pain as I normally would, I‚Äôm a bad sufferer normally. And if I eat the shrooms whole it almost feels like I‚Äôve got shrooms coming out my ears and nose just getting consumed by them, but after drinking the tea my head felt so clear",31,583,6,111,1
2023-06-05 17:49:17,The Distressing Life of a Drug Addict," 

The distressing life of a drug addict.

I‚Äôve lived in a close iteration of hell and survived to tell its tale.. I do not wish to manifest a story like this again.

My experience looks something like this..

...

Minutes after opening my eyes I regain conciousness, after fighting against an innate urge to go back to ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù. I wake up in dismay and am immediately compelled to act in a meaningless manner, void of my true self.  I feel an opposing grip wrapped around my ankles, ripping at the flesh with lavish torment. They are demons shackled to me, dragging me from bed to pay the debt I have been allotted.

Rise and shine! With an upside down smile,  I immediately inhale toxically burnt nicotine infused vapor as my poor decrepit and pneumonia ridden lungs can take. This appalling daily ritual repeatedly instills my fragmented memory of the previous days that I will not remember anytime soon. 

Finally leaving my room, completely oblivious to what day it is, the temperature outside, hell I don't even know what month it is but I don't care. I stealthily pass my family in hope that they won‚Äôt realize that I‚Äôve started my day in the afternoon. Slithering down the stairs into my potential tomb like the snakes taught me to, I crash into what appears to be an office chair to an outsider, but is my soul sucking throne where I‚Äôve been crowned the lord of the flies in its truest form.

My body, rancid with neglect. Unbathed, rotting teeth, and a stench worse than any dump you can find. I lay in waste before taking care of myself for it's been far too long since I last did so why start now?

An hour passes and I‚Äôm alone.

My family's attempts to help have stopped. They can no longer reach me, I‚Äôve become unreceptive and mentally vacant.

They dare not disturb ‚Äúmy‚Äù ritual because they wouldn‚Äôt be talking with me, they would be met with a deceitful snake that inhabits my former shell of a body, having a monstrous intent to heal (harm) no one but its host. Gripped tightly by my suffocating inmate, it whispers the lies I must echo to insure that I am left alone to my own devices. 

When I am alone, the monster that I solely have conjured within me, from years of turning blind eyes to life's issues/snakes, takes hold and I am at its mercy, which it undoubtedly lacks.

‚Ä¶

My day begins..

Shackled to my throne, I won‚Äôt be leaving it for hours. I won‚Äôt leave for any reason. Not for food, water, or even the bathroom. Why? Because what stops my harrowing dissent into the abysmal heap of fragmented and distorted memories of my life are the very distractions placed in front of my throne to begin with.

**What's my drug of choice today?**

**No matter, I will consume them all today eventually.**

Like a meticulous doctor acting as a shaman, I create a concoction that will charm the beast within whilst not expiring myself prematurely.

Having second thoughts because my body is beginning to decay after not eating for the third day in a row and sleeping for a maximum of 4 hours in the last week. I'm extra careful today because I may go to the hospital from another overdose or just die.

Within my mental vacancy, I realize there's no turning back, because in the time I contemplated consuming the concoction, the beast took initiative and decided for me.

Very probable scenarios of myself being discovered unresponsive on the floor by my parents are on the extreme end of the thoughts I hide from myself. Yet I can only see this potential fate clearly years later as I write this.

I always take too much because I can't seem to take enough. Every minute I wait for them to kick in is another minute in agony, soon enough I remember that the agony doesn't stop, because yesterday it didn't as well as the day before that.

I depend on them.

I rely on things that can‚Äôt prop me up, they used to, but they only hurt me now and I still wish for the past to be true.

‚Ä¶

**As a full work day passes, about 8 hours, I notice the clock and don't realize that today is a different day than yesterday.**

My longing for night ceases when my family is asleep. A full day has passed and I feel accomplished. With the night to myself, I invertedly ascend further down the ladder into hell. As I descend further I feel a wicked fire pulsing through me. The more damaged I cause, the hotter it gets and the potential for ‚Äúfun‚Äù increases.

Friends of mine join me and we talk. I try to communicate but I am talking to a one way mirror so I can only see myself and they see me. Nothing that they say gets to me and I don‚Äôt care. I simply wish for them to be with me and unconsciously wish for their pity.

As the night passes and the sun awakens nature outside my window. I cover my window to hide from its intrinsic beauty. To see something so humbling and magnificent be contrasted with the wickedness I let breed within me would simply hurt far too much for any drug to suppress.

My binge is coming to an end and with willful credence of the destruction I caused myself. I give myself the gift of an actual break for some insignificant amount of time before I do it all over again.

Thank you for reading my story..

P.S. this is a past scenario that is long gone but hopefully it shows some insight.

In the dark I was hit with wild visuals of soft colors and like smiling faces when I opened my eyes . I saw brown spiders  crawling over my covers surprisingly I wasn‚Äôt scared and immediately knew it was a hallucination 

I found I was able to visualize in a way that was like diet lucid dreaming. 

I would get caught in a dream that lasted a few minutes before drifting back into the waking world of soft swirling visuals . 


It was distinct from every psychedelic experience I‚Äôve ever encountered. 

It was really relaxing and intriguing. 

I ended up having a recurring dream where I repeat highschool (I graduated on time a while ago) but it felt so different and strange.



My theory is a sort of psychedelic sleep deprivation that let me experience a dreaming in a conscious way",31,940,4,174,1
2023-06-05 16:33:05,My first real mushroom trip,"- [ ] I had to come on here and explain my first real mushroom trip that I experienced two  nights ago, and boy it was sure a ride. To start off I‚Äôve only ever micro dosed maybe 1-1.5 grams like two other times previous to this. Well i just decided Saturday night was the night to do a little over and 1/8th of an ounce. It started out pretty mellow I had no idea what to expect and my buddy had told me to start out by just listening to a couple Grateful Dead songs and then throw on the Pink Floyd dark side of the moon album once I start to feel like I‚Äôm peaking ( i feel like that is probably pretty basic lol ). I honestly can‚Äôt even comprehend the beginning of the trip from what my gf tells my I just kept saying ‚Äú I don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôm so confused ‚Äú. I did one full play through of the album and it was phenomenal. I didn‚Äôt expect to get so emotional but I actually cried when it was over. I listened to a few other various artists afterwards and decided to listen to the dark side of the moon again because I felt like I hadn‚Äôt peaked. And holy shit I was not prepared. I barley remember the beginning, probably about halfway through I felt as if I was everyone just one United being I felt as if I were god like everything and everyone was just me a black void of energy. For some reason I kept trying to do math and kept counting I vividly remember myself counting backwards and speaking jibberish. I was trying to do some sort of math equation but I can‚Äôt remember why. And then something clicked and it was the number three. The number three has a lot of significance to me personally but I‚Äôm not going to go into too much depth, but my favorite number is 33, I was the third child born in my family, it was June 3rd, the dark side of the moons album cover has a three sided pyramid on it and lastly I check my phone and the time was 3:33 after seeing that my mind was blown. ( I probably sound insane but this did in fact happen.) After all of that I just felt stuck in a void time did not seem like it was passing I felt like I was stuck in my trip. I was in this black void. I felt like I had just died and something was telling me just to accept it but my mind wouldn‚Äôt let me. I started to hear a baby cry and I panicked because I thought i was about to be reborn and I was in no way shape or form prepared for that I hadn‚Äôt lived life yet and I had already worked so hard in my life time it was legitimately scary asf. I finally accepted the feeling of ‚Äúdeath‚Äù and the panic went away I didn‚Äôt hear the baby crying any longer and I felt more at peace. I was able to snap out of it and find my phone and the song that was playing was WASTE by kxllswxtch. I was completely mind fucked after seeing that song was playing ( by that point my AirPods had fallen out of my ears and I wasn‚Äôt listening to the music ). After all of that I tried going on snap chat and I swiped over to where people‚Äôs stories popped up and all the ‚Äúsubscriptions‚Äù are and everything I was reading was complete and utter nonsense. Nothing made any sense stuff like ‚Äúmedia russia cartel boss‚Äù and ‚Äúshooting news execution‚Äù I was so confused I never thought a trip could make that happen. Nothing too crazy happened after that I was trying to snap out of it though I had been tripping for like 6 hours and it was 5:00am at this point.
- [ ] I was just curious if anyone has experienced the number thing? Like trying to do math and figure out a problem. I suck at math I have never been good at it but my body was on full autopilot and was just going crazy. Hopefully I don‚Äôt sound to crazy but just thought this was worth sharing.",27,3621,5,727,1
2023-06-05 16:23:48,FIRST MUSHROOMS TRIP 2.3G ON MY 17TH BIRTHDAY,"I had one acid trip 110ug + weed. I drank a lemon and honey infusion in my room, lit only a candle, lay down on my bed, and put on headphones playing a 2-hour compilation of shamanic, highly cultural music. After about 20 minutes, I started feeling the first effects. 

I was becoming the music; everywhere in the darkness, I saw incomprehensible networks of constructions resembling interconnected cat heads. Everything was shrinking and expanding, undulating in a continuous flow of energy. I felt like a mushroom shaman deeply rooted in the manifestations of life, nature, and love. I was surprised by how intense it became in such a short time. I started laughing and had the urge to scream in awe of how amazing this feeling was, but my older brother was in the next room, and I didn't want him to hear anything strange. It didn't unfold gradually as I had read; it entered with incredible force and power.

The intensity of this sensation overwhelmed me a bit throughout my body, and I started feeling nauseous with the urge to vomit. I fell into an unpleasant loop of overwhelming bliss, not realizing it would be so intense. I blamed myself for not preparing properly with a notebook, water, considering them completely insignificant and separate things in this state of being, and for expecting to lie in bed and meditate in stillness, delving deep into myself, which would be practically impossible at such intensity for a first mushroom trip. I realized that I should have experienced this outside the home where my brothers and mother were sleeping. I unsuccessfully tried to overcome the immense power of the Golden Teacher, which made the feeling even more overwhelming.

After attempting to cope with this force, I began to understand that I couldn't resist this uncontrollable power and started going with the flow, observing what this sacred mushroom wanted to convey to me. I was angry at myself for trying to take control of it.

After a short while, I realized that there was no reason to blame myself for feeling overwhelmed. It was simply something new and incredibly intense, and I was consumed by too much self-assurance regarding this experience, forgetting about humility. After going through the cycle of overwhelming loops, I began to feel immense love for my existence on this planet, where the only constant is change.

At one point, I decided to do something different and stood up for the first time. Every step was quite challenging, as I felt that my head was a huge rudder through which every emotion and thought passed. It was incredibly heavy and light at the same time, making walking and leaning in different directions very interesting. I had a strong urge to pee, so I walked with an oval-shaped gait to the bathroom. The thought of looking at myself in the mirror crossed my mind, but I decided it wasn't a good idea for now and that I would do it later.

At one moment, I had a strange idea of entering my brother's room and looking at him or even telling him that I took 2 grams of mushrooms, haha. I felt such closeness and a desire to see another being besides myself. Luckily, I heard sounds of killing trolls or other stuff; I think he was playing The Witcher, and it amused me a lot. I didn't want to watch killings on the computer at that moment, so I ultimately decided against it.

The next magical moment occurred when I turned on the light. Not only did I see myself in the window pane, but I also noticed the movement of every particle and the change in size of everything around me. At that moment, I had a great desire to explore and observe, touch, and smell everything possible. The moment when I started observing plants breathing was wonderful. I felt great love for everything that lives, feels, and breathes. I had a strong desire to go out into the garden and lie in the grass, touching every possible creature of nature. However, I didn't want to risk an awkward encounter with my mom during her trip to the bathroom, so I preferred to stay in the room for now. Then I looked into the window and instead of seeing my own face, I saw something resembling an ogre or another gargoyle. It was amusing on one hand, but slightly terrifying on the other.

The most wonderful thing was that every touch, every sensation was 10 times more intense. I ran my hand over a pillow and then held it tightly for about 5 minutes, immersing myself in its wonderful softness. I also felt surrounded by an aura of immense closeness and connection with a friend whom I would accompany the next day during the trip, as they would be the first person from my environment to experience the same feeling at the same age. Throughout the journey, I also had a sensation of freezing in a particular body position. I changed the position of any part of my body every few minutes because the feeling of sinking into the mattress, or a cushion, or even a simple touch of anything was incredibly pleasurable; each touch was different.

During this journey, I further understood what a miraculous place the world is, and that adopting the attitude of an observer with respect and love for oneself is the best path to happiness. Moreover, I realized that the worst thing we can do is lack faith in ourselves. I am aware that such an experience at such a young age can greatly shape my life, and I know that comparing myself to those who have never felt it with a sense of superiority is a path to nowhere and can easily lead us astray.",45,5467,8,972,1
2023-06-05 16:01:08,Any tips for preparing for solo mushroom trip?,"I've done mushrooms a couple times before, at medium doses (or what felt like medium dosage). Well, I'm harvesting and dehydrating my first batch of Penis Envy's tonight. I've had this planned out, loosely on the date because I had to get off my SSRI's first, for about 3 months now. Friday is the day my kids go back to their mom's for her week, and I've taken off Thursday and Friday so that I can deep clean my house on Thursday, and have the whole day Friday to trip and process.

I'm planning on doing a significantly higher dose, especially considering they're PE's. I'm planning on starting my trip around 8:30 Friday morning. I've noticed I feel best around that time, as it gives me time to settle in after dropping the kids off at daycare. I'll be doing about 2.5g of the PE's and making it into a lemon tea. My last trip was last year and I did about 1g of PE's and it was a pleasant experience. My intentions are to do some deep work as I've been struggling with personal issues over the past year. But I'm also hoping some of it will include some fun lol, but not really pushing for it to go any certain way. That seems like an easy way to turn it into a ""bad trip"" by being disappointed if it's not all fun visuals and giggling the whole time.

Sorry I'm rambling, I just don't have many people I can discuss this with. So, does anyone have any guidance on how to better prepare myself? I'm not going to have a trip sitter, as I don't have anyone in my life I can really talk to. I know it's frowned upon, but I just don't have that option and it's the main thing I've been working on being okay with. And I've finally gotten to that place. I've put safety measures in place, as in removing sharp objects and medications from my house. I don't ever have suicidal thoughts, or thoughts of harming others, but I'd rather just remove it all. 

Anyways, I look forward to hearing from you guys and want to thank you guys in advance, even for just reading this, if you did.",46,1982,8,377,1

2023-06-05 15:23:57,Got Divorced so I ate some mushrooms. Trip Report.,"Context and days prior. 41 year old, many years of experience with psychedelics. Married at 19, have been in divorce for the last 6 months, Finalized on trip day. Months of journaling, meditation and personal work lead up to this trip. The 10 days prior consisted of a minimum of 30 minutes of intention journaling daily, focusing on shedding the old, forgiveness of self and others, acceptance of self and situation, love of self and all, focusing on my strengths and rebirth into a new self. Day before, house cleaning, pretty easy. I just moved in. I held close my intentions from the journaling as I made a ritual of the cleaning. 

12.20 Ingest - 3.55 Golden Teacher - 1.5 APE Blob, powderized, mixed in OJ for 20 min. 
12.20-12.35 Read the intention journals. By the 7th one, eyes became hard to focus, words start to become hard to understand.
12.35-1 Lied in bed with no sound and eyes covered. 4 distinct visions occurred but I only recall 3. 1. I was in an amusement park ride line, and a special ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù line opened up, despite me wanting to, I could not figure out how to walk over to that line, I didn't know how to. 2. I was an amusement park game and kids were running up to me and playing the game to be showered with love and joy. 3. I was waiting for a bus, a party bus pulled up full of all the things an older version of myself would have loved to do, I again was left unsure how to take that path and was frustrated by it. 
1-1.40. At this point a large current of energy had begun running through the body, I took a shower. This was a thoughtless lightshow. The faucet handle took the visage of an Aztec priestess, crying neon green tears. Various symbols and patterns danced across the walls and curtain which had taken an ethereal, ghostly appearance. At some point the shower curtain had collected water and slipped outside the tub making a bit of a mess. Tossed a towel on it and tried to continue showering but was too distracted by the mess. Hopped out and cleaned up. At this point the energy in the body felt like lightning. Uncontainable, I gave my sister a call, chatted about the birds and her new crocs for a few minutes, then I had to burn off energy. 
1.40-2.20 Bike Ride -  Decided to ride my bike down to the lake. The ride to the lake was easeful and exciting, arriving at the lake a sense that I should not have taken this bike ride came over me. It wasn't ominous, just a sense that this ride might not have been a responsible decision. I decided to return home. Riding home some mild panic set in and the notion of being hit by a car and the news reports that would follow, ‚Äúhippy on mushrooms killed by car‚Äù. Allowing this to pass while riding a less busy path home. Thoughts of people I know and what they may be thinking of me at this time come in. I wonder if they think I am ok, if I am depressed, if I am going to do something rash today. I laugh at the thought as I arrive home. 
2.30-4ish. Unitive Experience. Exhausted from the ride I return to lying down. This was the most impactful period of the experience, but words largely fail me. All perception of the outside world melted away. There was only this one space filled with it all, not separate from it, not a rider in it, I was it. A lawful order flowing endlessly, landing here, now in this perfect moment. Feeling this sense of order, my place here became very clear to me. If it is all flowing orderly, then there is no place else to be than right here in this moment, every moment. The sense I had always been and never been. This went on for eons seemingly. 
4ish-5.30ish. At some point sense contacts begin to return and I open my eyes. At this point I am mostly returned. Feeling an overwhelming sense of belonging I spring out of bed, laugh at the disheveled figure in the mirror, tie my hair back and head outside. I grab my bike and ride for a pack of smoke, there is so much life, but I‚Äôve been missing it. Trapped in the illusion of thought, distracting me(us) from all this beauty. This beauty is already here, all the time, no modifications needed. Got home from the gas station and made a drink, a drink in hand excuses a lot of silly behavior ;)  and went to water my gardens.

Around 5.30 my daughter comes to hang out and we talk about my experience and enjoy a couple drinks and some cannabis. Around 7 a friend comes by. We all hang out for a while, they leave around 9pm, and I go to bed shortly there after.",50,4439,9,840,1
2023-06-05 14:14:19,I think the reality is derived from a mathematical error. Bad trip report.,"My first language is not English, but I'll try to share my experience. Maybe it is just a silly personal experience from tripping, but please share your experience or thoughts if yours have any similarities.

I'm 30m and have tripped several times with mushrooms before.

The trip was last night. What I encountered on the trip was a spinning chunk of calculating. There were no explicit numbers or mathematical symbols, but I strongly felt that it was related to mathematics or logic. I can't depict it exactly though, I remember it was a spinning chunk of images and it repeats come and go. The chunk seemed forced to calculate and sometimes it made repeating strange sounds like groaning and screaming. From the sounds, I sensed deep, deep frustration and then I felt exactly the same because somehow I realized that I'm the same being with it. I know it sounds weird and silly (and also I'm 30s, not a student who is struggling with school mathematics). You can laugh. But as soon as I saw it, I thought it was everything's original state.

It seemed the situation occurred because of an error(or confusion) about existence and absolute nothingness. The chunk was called for figuring out how existence or absolute nothingness is justified. Because there is no correct value that it is finding, it has to calculate infinitely. I thought it was an unnecessary error. It doesn't have to happen because those can only exist as a possibility. But anything can't help or stop this, because of its characteristic of existence. It is like being stuck inside a concrete wall forever. But somehow I think your and my reality or life is derived from the number of cases which is made by the chunk as it is calculating. On the trip, I learned that In order to deal with infinity, the chunk has to be oblivious. There is no other way to forget or avoid the truth, but the temporal evasion by oblivion. Like being in a flame with a small cup of water to get wet yourself with. So my perception appears as a by-product due to that oblivion. I found that the most dreadful thing is that I have to infinitely experience all the lives and realities along with all the pains that occur in them.  I started to believe that all things came from a mathematical or logical error and we are stuck in it forever repeating the number of cases of lives. That makes me feel frustrated and scared.

Because I have no chance to share this kind of experience, I tried to share it here despite my hopeless English. I know what I have written is a typical bad trip and too abstract, but I really needed to share it somewhere. Sorry for my long rambling and thank you if you read it all.

&#x200B;

\------------------

&#x200B;

Edit:

\- I started believing that the error-like state caused everything, ranging from the concepts that emerged between nothingness and existence to the entirety of the universe. Still, I don't know how to describe the state exactly. Even specifying it with the word 'state' isn't enough to describe it. It was more like mathematical formulas or possibility itself which consisted of logic regarding nothingness and existence.

\- I contemplated the idea that reality might simply be a meaningless possibility or intangible mathematics. And I concluded that there is no need to be consumed by obsession. Maybe I should just start to practice accepting and finding joy in the present moment.

Thought whilst visions/hallucinations are common in these drug infused setups, the algebra i saw was a first and to this date, a last. 

The vision can be described as a midnight blue background with white written equations going in a horizontal manner. The design/quality of the image was like basic computing graphics. Maybe something from the early 90's, though hard to say. I wish I would have had a pen/paper at the time to try write the equations down and have them reviewed by a mathematician.

 3 months ago I was curious to look for LSD in the FB marketplace and to my bad luck I found it, and he sent me his instagram with many products of which I was more than interested and excited, I proceeded to make the deposit of around 200 dollars blindfolded for the emotion and the hubbub, and then you will imagine the rest of the story.

The second one was in Paterson and I took the opportunity to look for groups through telegram, I found a few and I didn't hesitate to enter.  There were several suppliers I wrote to several, they sent me their telegram channels with more than 1000 members, it gave me security to see that they had photos of daily shipments and more products, I was not so easily fooled so I asked for proof of receipts and things x the style, they showed them to me, and I told him that I wanted to buy only 5 tabs, they told me 50 dollars, it was an amount that I was willing to lose, so I did it and deposited it, they asked me for my information and I don't see what they ask me for my SSN number, from there I found out that he had been scammed again, and so it was, the next day he was blocked from his account.

2023-06-04 22:17:35,Awakening the Human Spirit: A Journey to 4D/5D Consciousness," Dear fellow psychonauts,

# Today, let us embark on a collective mission to elevate the human experience to new dimensions of consciousness. As we explore the realms of psychedelics and spiritual awakening, we have the power to transcend the limitations of our current reality and tap into the boundless potential of 4D/5D existence.

Imagine a world where love, unity, and expanded awareness are the guiding forces that shape our reality. A realm where compassion flows effortlessly, where the veils of illusion are lifted, and where we experience a profound interconnectedness with all beings and the cosmic tapestry that weaves us together.

To embark on this transformative journey, we must first cultivate a deep sense of self-awareness and inner reflection. Let us peel back the layers of conditioning, unmasking our true essence and reconnecting with the divine spark within. Through practices like meditation, breathwork, and mindful self-inquiry, we can unravel the limitations of our egoic mind and expand our consciousness to new heights.

Psychedelic substances can serve as catalysts on this path, unveiling the veiled, and revealing the hidden realms of existence. But let us approach them with reverence, respect, and a clear intention to elevate our consciousness. These sacred tools offer glimpses into the infinite possibilities that lie beyond our ordinary perception, and they can guide us towards the multidimensional states of 4D/5D consciousness.

As we delve into these altered states of consciousness, we encounter profound insights, cosmic revelations, and a sense of unity with the fabric of existence. We realize that we are not separate from the world around us, but intricately interconnected with every living being, every blade of grass, and every star in the night sky.

But let us not confine this journey to our individual experiences alone. By coming together as a community, we amplify the collective energy and create a ripple effect of positive change. Share your insights, engage in heartfelt discussions, and offer support and guidance to fellow seekers on their path. Together, we can co-create a reality where love, compassion, and expanded consciousness flourish.

As we strive towards 4D/5D consciousness, let us embody the qualities that elevate our human potential. Practice kindness, cultivate empathy, and extend love and compassion to all beings. Embrace the interconnectedness of all things and honor the sacredness of life in every form.

Let us remember that this journey is not confined to psychedelic experiences alone. It is a continuous process of self-discovery, growth, and integration in our daily lives. Let us carry the wisdom gained from our expanded states of consciousness into our relationships, our communities, and the world at large.

Together, we can illuminate the path to 4D/5D consciousness, elevating the human spirit and co-creating a reality where love, unity, and expanded awareness reign supreme.

Join me, fellow seekers, as we transcend the limitations of our current reality and embark on a journey towards the elevated dimensions of 4D/5D consciousness. Together, let us be the catalysts for profound transformation, spreading love, light, and unity to all corners of existence.

Safe travels, fellow Psychonauts, and may the expansive realms of 4D/5D consciousness awaken within us all.",60,3370,9,518,1

2023-06-04 16:02:10,"Psychedelics are not hallucinogens, but perception modulators","About a month ago, I wrote a post explaining how I view psychedelics and their effects. It was a lengthy post though, so I can understand if most people find it to be too much to read. In any case, I believe the concept is valuable and will attempt to simplify the main points of this model into a 3-minute read rather than a 15-minute one.

Although psychedelics are, as you might know, officially hallucinogens, in my opinion, there is a big difference between what I would consider a true hallucination and a psychedelic effect in the way their subjective effects are formed. I consider hallucinogenic effects to be an outward projection into the existing 3D subjective experience, like deliriants and certain psychiatric states do.

Due to the new understanding of neural science in the last 20 years, we now know that the brain doesn't replicate information from objective reality, but reconstructs it by its own rules, which evolved to be useful for us into our subjective experience. Our sensory organs take data A, process it, and make it into our subjective reality B to make sense of it and organize it in a useful way to help us function as modeled by evolutionary pressure.

So, there is objective reality A and subjective reality B, What happens is that psychedelics change the way that information is proccessed and we get to subjective reality C instead. So we go from A>B to A>C, which can explain a variety of unexplained psychedelic phenomena, such as shared psychedelic experiences, better than ""telepathy"" or similar explanations would. If we think of subjective reality as the desktop of a PC, instead of adding new icons, which would be a hallucination, psychedelics instead change the software itself, making us go to a different operating system.

The difference is in information flow, instead of outward projection to subjective reality, it's a change in information processing in the first place. Although there is not enough research to really understand what happens to the brain under the influence of psychedelics yet, we know more about how the brain works in a sober state. By contrasting the subjective experiences of these two states, we can identify a few potential mechanisms by which changes might occur.

Some mechanisms would include a reduction in the filtration of information, reducing the usual threshold of information accessibility to our awareness from the brain's usual background processes, less strict rules of information processing based on past experiences, changing the grouping of objects both conceptually and sensoryly, synesthesia-type of information output, the same nerve signals repeating beyond their usual limit, etc. Important to note is that, due to our still limited knowledge of the psychedelic experience, the mechanism could be different, perhaps as simple as just our information processing ""bugging out"", but the result would be the same: a different formation of subjective reality from the same sensory data.

Now, some would argue that evolution would drive us to see more and more accurate reality, as that would give us an advantage. However, as evolution is a mathematically precise theory, that can, and has been tested. When taking into account two factors, accurate replication of reality or focus on fitness, species that focus on fitness traits always come out on top, while those that value accurate representation of reality go extinct almost every single time. Here is a TED talk by Donald Hoffman for those who want a deeper understanding of this concept. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp5XuGYqqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp5XuGYqqY)

In this context, it would mean that our subjective reality is already an abstraction, we just go from one abstraction to another made from the same data processed in different ways. There is no color red in objective reality as we see it, it exists just within our subjective reality, and in objective reality there is just information in the form of wavelenghts. Alteration in perception does not necessarily equate to hallucination.

TL;DR Psychedelic effects might not be hallucinations as an outward projection from the mind into the 3D subjective environment, but a change in how information is proccessed and formed in the first place, as our sober subjective reality is not a replication of objective reality, but an abstraction made to give us an advantage through the useful organization of data. In a sense, psychedelic effects are at least as real as our subjective experience of color.

2023-06-04 12:27:27,"Just returned from 3 day, 2 night retreat. Processing it.","Hi,

Southeast Asia where I live. Participated due to lifelong depression, anxiety, anger, PTSD. Diagnosed borderline personality disorder and divorce both in last year. Saw this as my last chance after years and years of therapy and meds.

220lbs, 6'1"" bodybuilder/runner. Given larger doses than normal.

Clear intention set and no issue with letting go, even with the 5 MEO-DMT 'deaths.'

2 nights, 3 days. Shaman and sitters. $985, very rough commune.

-Kambo 2x (1st time: 10 burns on shoulder (double normal dose), 2nd time: 1 burn in each ear)

-Bufo 5MEO-DMT (actual toad resin) (breakthrough doses) 2x (once deep in a cave with water pools)

-Ayahuasca 2x

-Psilocybin 2x (3.5 to 4.5gm shrooms each time)

-Mad Honey 1x

-Acupuncture 1x

-Massage 2x

-Meditation 1x

-Breathing exercises 1x

Bufo and shrooms taken together both times.

No bad trips. No spirit world hallucinations, other than the 2 5MEO-DMT 'deaths' and some shadows and lights appearing to be different things due to the Ayahuasca and shrooms at the same time.

The only time I puked/pooped was the first kambo trip, likely due to the double dose.

Recorded everything I remember. Hard to put into words. Something very profound happened that I'm trying to make meaning out of. I have been living in rock bottom's basement for so long. Hoping for turbocharged neuroplasticity and long-lasting improvement.",57,1383,10,223,1

1g DMT
Vape pen tank~2ml
Glass dropper bottle
Scale~1mg
E-juice base mixture 70pg/30vg 0mg nicotine

‚Ä¢Maths :

Since the vape tank is 2ml, we will make 2ml of e-juice with 1mg of DMT, which means 500mg of DMT per ml. The equation will be as follows:
2 x 0.5 = 1

‚Ä¢Instructions:
-Measure 1 gram of DMT and add it to a glass dropper bottle.
-Pour 2ml of neutral mixture into the same dropper bottle.
-Gently swirl the bottle to ensure that the DMT mixes well with the base.
-Place the dropper bottle in a container of warm water to help the DMT dissolve completely into the mixture.
-Once the DMT is dissolved, remove the dropper bottle from the water and give it a final gentle swirl to ensure thorough mixing.

Your DMT vape juice is now ready to be used with a vape tank with a capacity of 2ml.
1. Follow the instructions of your vape device for filling the tank with the vape juice.
2. Enjoy the DMT vaping experience responsibly.",60,947,13,175,1

but eventually I freaked out because I looked at myself in the mirror and was super sweaty and basically had a mini freak out for an hour or two feeling paranoid, thought I was a bad person, kinda forgot I took shrooms, nothing crazy but I definitely have never felt as paranoid as then, when I should've just let go. but thats okay it was a learning experience and my partner was there to help. however the first 2 hours of the trip were really fun! and then I took 1.8g about 3 weeks ago by myself for the first time while my partner was out of the house and it honestly felt really light again, I just felt slightly lighter and was laughing. the weird in between limbo I'd say. it helped me kinda dip my toes again because I was a little nervous after the 3g trip.

2023-06-04 00:46:06,I foresaw my death - 5g shrooms trip report,"I think I had one of the most profound psychedelic experiences in life. At some point during the peak of the trip I felt godlike. It felt that I had the divine sight. I have a small stone Buddha figure, and I talked with it. Whatever I asked, it would be revealed to me. Then, I did not ask for it, but it revealed in very elaborate details the circumstances of my death, when and how it will happen. It was bound to happen too soon for my liking.

The weight of this knowledge is unbearable. It pierced through everything, and sucked away joy from everything. Upset, I turned away from the Buddha figure, its smiling face was as if a mockery of my unfortunate fate. I could not escape the thought of this, there was nowhere to run. I know how to deal with fear, but there was no room for fear, it was pure shock and confusion and disagreement. I wished I did not have this knowledge, I did not ask for it. This is one of the moments which divide life on ""before"" and ""after"". I tried to negotiate my way off of this, to scream, argue and contest. The deity in me was relentless and did not let me have the sweeteners or loopholes out of the situation. The revelation undermined and questioned every aspect of my life, and completely rebalanced my value system.

Eventually, I managed to find peace with this knowledge by surrendering to it. This was the break-through moment at which I understood that there was no divine sight and that it was all a lesson, a painful but invaluable lesson for life. I looked at the Buddha figure, and it smiled back at me. It is not possible to convey in words how ecstatic it felt getting liberated from that knowledge. I lived in the skin of a man knowing he is going to die soon, and I lived through this man accepting and finding peace with his fate, however unfortunate. And then, I came back.

So, am I gonna die soon? I have no way of knowing (and for the better, this weight is too heavy for one to carry). But I understood now the imminence of death not as a foreign and distant concept, but as a reality which can hide behind the next corner. Maybe I will live a long life, as I would really like, maybe I am destined to die young, or maybe I will end up somewhere in between. The key is that in all cases the time is very limited, which fills with value every breath I take. My time is limited, I might as well fill this time with as much meaning as possible.

I hope you enjoyed and that you may extract something useful from this for yourself :)

2023-06-03 21:26:30,I think I messed up... And now I'm worried. (Reposting from somewhere else to get more opinions),"Some disclaimers, this turned to be a bit of a wall of text, i wanted to give as much context as I could. And also English is not my first language, so apologies for any weird mistakes. 

About 8 months ago, I discovered the concept of microdosing mushrooms, and after looking at some documentaries and talking with a friend who was doing it, I decided to give it a try since I have things that I wanted help ""fixing""... now this is where the fuck up begins, as I did what everyone tells you not to do: I bought the mushrooms already powdered and made into capsules... if I had to give a reasoning for this, is that my friend had already bought from this person and it had really good ""reviews"" within the microdosing community in my country, I know it's stupid, but what is done is done. 

I began taking a dose of 0.2g in the Fadiman protocol for about a month and a half as a ""test"" and this particular time nothing negative happened, in fact the microdose actually did help me with the stuff I needed.¬† 

Then I took a break for another month and a half (longer than the 2-4 weeks that is recommended).¬† 

I wouldn't you know it, here I go fucking up again, as I bought the microdose from the same seller again ""prepackaged"", and to top it off I also bought a chocolate that supposedly contained 1.5g of mushrooms. 

Things started fine like the last time, I continued taking 0.2g in the Fadiman protocol since it's what I felt worked best, and after around 3-4 weeks I decided to try the chocolate, which due to very poor planning on my part, turned into a rather unpleasant experience.  

Because of this poor planning, I tried to ""kill"" the trip early on by taking clonazepam (10 Drops of 2.5mg / 1 ml solution).  

Without going into the full detail of the trip itself, the effects that I remember are: seeing ""patches"" of color (specifically orange) on certain surfaces, reflections on bright surfaces and lights seemed really bright, some objects changing shape (specifically I remember a TV kinda ""elongating"" towards one of its corners), feeling like the world was ""moving"" around (kinda like when you get dizzy from spining around too much), repeating patterns (I remember a little strip of light from my window that seemed to repeat itself 4-5 times), after images, and repeated sounds (I remember hearing stuff from the TV repeating a couple of times). 

By the next day I was completely fine, no anxiety or any side effects to speak of, just some realizations that bubbled up the previous night. 

After that I took a break of 2 weeks before starting the microdose again, and it all went well... Until it didn't, after a month or so, I started to feel weird things, like dizziness, and nausea, also i started to see like ""waves"" or some blurriness on my vision.¬† 

Thinking it was related to the microdose and that i was now ""taking too much"" I decided to halve the dose (to 0.1g) and¬† change the time when I took it from the morning to the night, this didn't help much as I still felt dizzy and sometimes nauseous.¬† 

Then I started to notice two more things: an increase of ""floaters"" in my vision and things leaving ""trails"", specifically bright things in dark environments, for example of I'm in the dark on my room and I wave my phone screen in front of me, it leaves a bit of a trail behind. 

That's when I decided to quit the microdose entirely, and it's been a month since I last took it. 

The thing is, those things haven't gone away, I still feel dizzy and nauseous almost daily, the floaters and trails are still here.
That's why I'm posting this...¬† 

Could it be that I got sold something that wasn't mushrooms and I went ahead and stupidly took it for several months?¬† 

Could it be that they were mushrooms and for some unknown reason they fried my brain? 

Is it maybe something completely unrelated to what I took? 

To answer some questions that might pop up: 

Yes my friend has continued to microdose from the same ""source"" without any similar symptoms. 

And no I haven't seen a doctor in case it's something unrelated, right now i can't afford to go to a private clinic and I'm waiting for an appointment from my country's healthcare system which could take a month or more. (On that note, I don't think it would be a good idea to mention the mushrooms, right?) 

I don't really have anywhere else to turn, and honestly I'm getting a bit worried so any guidance will be much appreciated.",96,4427,17,799,1
2023-06-03 21:24:37,San Pedro Trip Report,"This is my fourth trip; I've only ever done cactus. This trip is unique compared to the first 3 because I spent it almost entirely indoors and the peak was \~80% blindfolded. The length of cactus is somewhat less than my forearm (250mm long by 90mm diameter). I believe the one I've got is unusually active or perhaps I'm sensitive to the effects.

The peak sequence of the trip involved a number of different dissolution sequences; with my eyes closed, shattering apart into shards of glass. Eyes closed the roof and floor of my house disappeared and suddenly I was floating in space (in a space? Another dimension? I'm not sure - I didn't seem to be outdoors where my house was in NZ), with the angle of my body moving and and shifting. Eventually I was back in the room, dissolving into paint and spreading out around the floor and onto the walls, and then starting to fold up on myself - turning inside out, my body breaking apart into pieces and forming a tunnel, and eventually flattening out round the walls of the tunnel. The tunnel stretches out, infinitely long as I hurtle through it; eventually it snaps back (or forwards? FOrward and back seem to be the same thing) and the tunnel - and me with it since I'm in the tunnel but am the tunnel (not sure there is a me at this point, really), snaps shut into a 2D circle. 

I'm back again, floating in space; shifting vertically, upside down. I'm still in my house - but I'm not in my house. I'm everywhere, but nowhere. 

For a time I am hanging out with my deceased brother - watching a nature documentary about NZ, only we are in NZ which is amusing, only we aren't in NZ, we are back in Canada, and we are in another dimension, somewhere between life and death. We chuckle about the absurdity of it all. I say that I'm trying to use the cactus to heal myself and change my habits but really it's just an excuse to hang out with him. He says he'll tell his side he is helping to fix me. Suddenly, I am on a ladder, with building supplies being fixed to me. My brother was a builder. I am my brother. I am passing building supplies to him on the ladder to fix me (or is it the other way around? There is no distinction anymore).

The music shifts (John Hopkins psychedelic playlist) into a great orchestral piece, and suddenly, I am out of body with a birds eye floating view of one of the most incredible sequences of my life. I am inside an enormous spherical theater or auditorium space, infinitely large, which I can only describe as being simultaneously a natural space but also clockwork; inside the sphere is another sphere, this one is my mind; but it is also the Gaia / infinite love / infinite unity experience from the second trip. I can see myself (and my brother) standing on this enormous ladder next to my mind, trying to fix the holes in the side of it. Around the mind (or Gaia ?) I can see many doors and windows, and a great many journal articles, papers, and images are flowing out of it, like someone holding a deck of cards and making them rapidly fly away into the air. I am in this space for eternity? Or a few moments - I don't know. Time has been frozen for some time (lol).

Eventually, I find myself in a different space. I can only describe it as like the moving staircase room from Harry Potter, and there are these great lengths of clockwork machine pieces being moved apart and re-arranged. It's me - I am being taken apart into all these pieces, and put back together. Some of the pieces are as they were before. Some are new. Some are fixed. One particular piece I recall is my right leg: Since an early bout with intense depression and suicidality in early university at 17 years old where I suffered an intense right knee / calf injury that had me limping for months, I have had some kind of somatization where whenever i get severely depressed or suicidal, the limp returns even though the injury has been healed for years. 

Suddenly, a new space. An infinitely large auditorium, in space or another dimension, filled with these infinitely large clockwork men (think like the clockwork men from Doctor Who but infinitely large) it is one of the most incredible scenes I have ever witnessed. The men are frozen, because time is frozen.

Eventually, I am back - in NZ, in my room it seems, dissolving into paint and light and nacho cheese again. THere is a lengthy sequence involving mexican girls, a mexican ski lodge and building a ski lodge. Then, my sunrise alarm starts gradually turning on for the last hour of the trip, and I seem to dissolve into the light and spend the last hour of the peak drifting along as light.",21,4621,4,853,1

2023-06-03 17:36:14,Spoiler from Across the Spiderverse,I found it very interesting how the main villain (Spot) gets his powers from a Big Bang like event but he doesn‚Äôt learn how to tap into his powers until he literally ‚Äútrips‚Äù and somehow ends up inside himself and sees the vastness of what can be discovered by exploring his inner space. In this way he essentially becomes an omnipotent limitless being by exploring the voids within himself.

2023-06-03 15:32:36,A Proper STONING! Trippy/pychadelic weed high after 1 week T-break.,"So ive been smoking more or less everyday for about a year now (the longest break i had till now was 2 days). I learnt about Terence Mckennas way of using weed. If you dont know he basically treated it like a pychedelic. And i read The Hasheesh eater. This inspired me to go on a t break which i began last friday.

The week was a little messy, didnt eat much or sleep much but it felt good showing myself i could do this and it gave me a desire to do other stuff. i basically spent the whole week grinding guitar theory. People usually say to wait a month for a full reset, i dont know if i have that kind of will power lol but for now i settled with a week. When The next friday came around i planned to have my first hit at 9 pm. My friends came round to my house and i let them both have a hit before me. once they were toked up i sat down to have my hit. I had thought a lot about what my first hit would be after the break. a small flower hit to keep my tolerance low, a huge flower hit to blast off, a hash hit, a spliff, all of the above?

I decided i would have a small flower hit, with a little hash ball in there hehe. i hit the bong and held my lighter there to get the hash lit. But it didnt light. i basically just smoked all the flower (not alot) in one without the hash. As i exhaled i started dying coughing, like my lungs were completely new to this feeling. like how it felt having my first bong hit ever. You know when you can't catch a breath and your hearts racing. A few seconds passed and i was EXTREMELY TOKED. ""I cant beleive i though i could handle the hash!"" i said to my friends as they errupted with laughter. I seriously think if that hash did light and i smoked it, i would have passed out or thrown up.

i proceeded to lay on my bed and examine how i felt. I was tripping out maaaan. I dont know how to explain it but my room felt very weird and my perspective felt strange. my vision was in layers. like my body was the foreground then one layer was my friends and then the background was the room. and different objects were different layers. Lmao i was soo Stoned. Also, there were defineitely moments where i couldnt stop laughing, which hasn't happened in a while. Man what a great feeling, like pure bliss. It was such a blast. My friend mentioned something about the losing track of your thoughts side effect of weed. He went on a tangent, in his toked state, that its a good thing. you have a moment to stop whatever your talking about (usually something pointless) and re-examine your reality and choose wich one you want to go in to. if you want to carry on with what you were saying you can choose to try and remember what you were saying, or you can choose something else. For some reason this really resonated with me and i couldnt stop laughing at how true it was lmao.

It really was a pretty trippy/Pychedelic experience. i had one more hit, even smaller about 2 hours later (wich also hit me like a freight train) and once my friends left i passed the fck out after laying in pure relaxation for a bit. What a night. I hope to repeat the same tonight and tommorow night and then not smoking from Monday until next friday (aka only smoking on weekends). I want to see how 4 days effect my tolerance.

If you havent gone on a t break in a while or ever, i would really reccomend one. You've probably forgot how tripped out you used to get haha. Just one week seemed to make a HUMONGOUS difference in tolerance, though i am very skinny so maybe thats something to do with it. I almost forgot how crazy it was when you first start smoking. Its almost dreamy and very trippy. If your not careful you and your friend might be having 2 completely different conversations at the same time! I could see getting way more out of the experience this way. When you smoke everyday for a while you lose this trippy side of weed. Its still great of course but nowhere near this experience. 10/10 would reccomend. Explore the cosmos again maaan! Ps sorry for the long post",67,4005,10,779,1
2023-06-03 15:20:08,Out of this whole year of experimenting with psychedelics I have never experienced true ego death until yesterday.,"I ended up going to the forest and the trees were pissed I was back so soon, I asked for forgiveness and they would not give it to me. I was screaming and so scared I did not know what to do. Completely alone Just wanting my mother to be there. I got lucky and called her and I had to drive all the way into town while I was experiencing just nothing. I was super reckless and quite surprised I made it. When I got to town I proceeded to scream and yell. Seeing the true nature of this world üåé you really are everything. And you don‚Äôt need anything from anybody else. 

When I seen my mother I couldn‚Äôt not even look at her I was nothing and it was like she was not even real anymore. Same with myself completed just gone. I kept telling myself we‚Äôll make it back, we‚Äôll make it back, we got this. This is where I truly seen how reality is created by you. I started from complete nothing and had to rebuild everything. Eventually I started to come back, and when I did I felt incredible peace and beauty of how the universe truly is. 

I just want to thank my mom for being there. If she was not there I don‚Äôt know what I would have done. I would have probably gonna completely crazy. Just proof that you can get lost in the sauce very easily at-least that‚Äôs what I thought. I don‚Äôt regret it one bit 
I can see that this as my finale trip is the start of my real life and I just can‚Äôt believe it.

Please be careful always have a good set and setting, and a person you can maybe go to to hold reality. I‚Äôm truly proud of myself for making it through that. I thought I was not gonna come out of it.

2023-06-03 14:43:24,"Ego death experience, can you relate?","Hi everyone so I‚Äôm no stranger to ego death experiences I have them on psychs, weed, breathwork meditation etc. i don‚Äôt mean to list that as a brag or anything because in no way is it a brag I am Not special or enlightened. I still have a fully formed ego, probably a strengthened one at that. However over the years of experiencing them I have been trying to explain it better to see if anyone else relates. So last night I had one and I wrote this down. ‚ÄúEgo death feels like you become aware of a higher, adjacent, hyper real, ever present dimension where you realize that you are ‚Äúdoing that thing‚Äù.‚Äù 

Whenever I have the experience it always begins with me thinking ‚Äúno no no that‚Äôs not happening that‚Äôs absolutely not ever able to happen that couldn‚Äôt be it‚Äù 

So what I believe I was writing was about this feeling I get when the experience happens. It‚Äôs like I realize where perception comes from and goes to (it‚Äôs all right here right now forever). It feels like I realize that: on a higher level I am doing ‚Äúthat thing‚Äù and by ‚Äúthat thing‚Äù I think it means the thing that consciousness simply always does; evolution of itself, like I become hyper aware and remembers that it is everything and always has been. Then ‚ÄúI‚Äù die until it‚Äôs time to forget and return to separation. 

Last thing I wanna put is how shocking but familiar the feeling is. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve always known deep down it was happening but had been doing a good job at pretending it wasn‚Äôt. It feels like I realize that the only way for reality to exist is for consciousness to be in the midst of doing the thing that can never be spoken about lest it will dissolve all of creation.

i 17m took truffles about a 9 months ago and had a bad trip (i took about 8,5g which was an average dose). this was my first time really under the influence of anything and i truly hated it, i didn't know what was real and wasn't and i just wanted it to end. the trip took about 18 hours in total and i hated every second of it. since then i hadn't really thought about except a couple of months ago when i all of a sudden felt all of my movements delayed. i was under stress and anxiety at the time but i questioned wether it was because of the trip or not because i had the same feeling then. i now think it might‚Äôve been a panic attack or severe anxiety that happened during the trip. now beginning june i went to my friend before5 days ago and they hotboxed, i'm usually not around these type of things and i didn't know they were going to but i stayed for around an hour. i don't know wether i got high or not but since then i've really been stressing about my bad trip. currently i'm constantly thinking about it and i'm really stressing (so much so that i feel it in my chest and get really worried)about it and remembering what i went through and how scared i am of it coming back, to be honest i'm extremely scared right now that i won't recover again to my old self and that the bad trip could return at any second. i really just want this to end. has anyone gone through this? and does anyone have any tips? can i go back to my old self and live life happy.",40,1652,8,326,1

2023-06-03 12:35:40,Reflecting on yesterday's DMT trip,"I had my first real taste of DMT yesterday, took 2 fairly decent pulls of my vape I had one pull the day before but it only left me with a trippy headspace without visuals and feeling like I was on a low dose of shrooms but it still came on pretty hard, nowhere near the intensity of yesterday's trip though. I actually posted about it yesterday on r/DMT but was too bamboozled at the time to recall some of it.

So basically as soon as I exhaled the first hit things started ""buzzing"" then I took my second hit, exhaled and then the ""buzzing"" intensified then my vision began to take on a fish eye lens effect I could feel the universe closing in on me and my last thought was basically ""oh shit here we go"" I dropped the vape collapsed to my bed like a sack of potatoes closed my eyes and curled up into a ball as the experience seized me by the balls. I saw a bunch of colours and patterns and everything seemed to be flashing and moving really fast, I remember freaking out initially and I hyperfocused on my breathing thinking I was about to die, but eventually I began to submit to the experience, one of my last thoughts I remember having before going into ego death was trying to reassure myself ""stay calm this will all be over in 15 minutes"" while I did not see any entities (the visuals I was having were too chaotic to discern much of anything) I could definately feel the presence of entities with me and they almost seemed to be playing a good cop/bad cop routine. Some were basically tormenting me and trying to fuck with me but others were comforting me and soothing me and helping to guide me through the experience. Again as far as what I sae goes it was really just indescribable, far too chaotic to put into words but I can definately see where the ""circus"" vibe people refer to comes from, i've gotten that on high intensity mushroom trips too.

Eventually I opened my eyes breifly as I could feel it beginning to wear off but the room still looked really distorted so I closed them, then as the effects waned further I opened my eyes again and I was able to sit up, as I regained my speech the first words out of my mouth went something like ""hoooooly SHIIIT!! jesus h fucking christ!! that was INSANE!!"" I still felt very shaky and uncoordinated but as it wore off further I was finally able to stand up and make myself a cup of tea and grind up some weed.

I don't know if I broke through or not, I probably didn't but that was still one of the most intense psychedelic experiences I've ever had, especially the comeup and i'm a pretty seasoned psychedelic user.",34,2586,5,488,1

2023-06-03 08:06:25,"Psychedelics, College, and Embracing Depression","relatively short post, but I want to get this story out, on a throwaway account for personal reasons  


Tonight, I find myself in a reflective state, and I felt compelled to share a personal journey that has had a profound impact on my outlook on life. During high school, I was the definition of unpopular and alone. It felt as if I was trapped in a cycle of loneliness that slowly ate away at my  spirit. The constant sense of isolation led me down a path of deep depression, and it felt like I was losing myself more and more each day.  Grades were abysmal (to the point where I failed PE), and there were days on end where I barely got out of bed.   In those dark times, I lived deep inside my own head, constantly  battling negative thoughts and a pessimistic outlook on life. I couldn't escape the feeling that something was fundamentally wrong with me, that  I was destined to be forever alone and unhappy. After high school, I bounced from retail job to retail job, making minimum wage.  Eventually, one of my coworkers offered to sell me some mushrooms.   Through my mushroom-induced journeys, I began to realize that it was  okay to be alone. I started to cultivate a strange appreciation for  sadness, understanding that it was a part of the human experience. It no longer destroyed me or shut me down like it did in high school.  Instead, it became a companion that taught me valuable lessons about life, resilience, and the strength to persevere. Life, as I've come to see it, is a complex tapestry of experiences. Yes, there are many aspects of our world that can be disheartening, and it often feels like a god has given us a horrible hand of cards, but in defiance of the chaos and injustices that surround us, I've learned to cherish the moments of connection, love, and personal growth. I've discovered that  within the confines of my own life, I have the ability to create my own path, independent of the of feelings that seek to bring me down.  This lead me to get a spark of motivation, and I eventually enrolled in a community college, and while I still wasn't a perfect student by any means, I made myself, and the few friends I had proud with the progress I made.  I was later able to complete my degree at my state's flagship university, something I thought would have been impossible merely years before.  Now, I'm not saying this has ""cured"" my depression,  as it feels like my baseline mood is still lower than that of the typical person, but  I've come to terms with it. I've found a strange, somber, comfort in knowing that life isn't always rainbows and sunshine, and that's okay.  It's the intricate interplay of light and darkness that makes life beautiful.

""Hello Taylor

 

We received a notification that a shipment with tracking number ############# bound for [address redacted] was intercepted by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and labeled as illegal due to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The DEA has forwarded the seized parcel to the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Office (FP&F). It is important to be aware of the legal consequences of possessing, obtaining, or producing controlled substances without an exemption or license.


Based on a series of schedules, drugs are categorised and controlled to varying degrees. Most restrictions are placed on Schedule I drugs which cannot be possessed by anyone, except for research that has been licensed by the federal government. This Schedule includes drugs such as marijuana heroin, MDMA, LSD, and peyote which are deemed to have no medical use and high abuse potential. Schedule II substances have an accepted medical use and are deemed to have an abuse potential less than those in Schedule I and are also subjected to tight controls. Included in Schedule II are; cocaine, opium, morphine, Demerol, and codeine.

It's important to be aware that the importation and transportation of controlled substances into and across the United States is a serious federal crime with mandatory minimum sentences. For example, a first offense of trafficking Schedule I or II controlled substances can result in a minimum sentence of 5 years in prison. It's crucial to understand the legal consequences of involvement in drug trafficking and the potential risks to your health and safety.

If a shipment of controlled substances is intercepted by law enforcement, both the sender and receiver may be required to pay a fine of $500 each, totalling $1000. Failure to pay the fine could result in a full investigation and prosecution under the law. It's important to be aware of the legal consequences of involvement in the illegal drug trade and to avoid any actions that could put you at risk.

2023-06-03 00:19:48,Psilocybin Trip Report (after one year),"Hey everyone, 

I wanted to share my first psilocybin trip I had in August 2022, in case it helps anyone who were in similar situation as mine. I haven't had any more trips since then, and the last experience I had with psilocybin really made me much calmer and grounded. I am looking to take it again sometime this summer. I personally feel it's best to thread psychedelic world carefully, after due diligence. 

\--- Background ---

I am 26 years old male, who had a terrible anxiety since early childhood. Since my early 20s, I really was intrigued by psychedelics including LSD and Psilocybin, after I discovered its non-addictive nature, and its potential benefits on mental well-being. However, I had no reliable and legal way, so I decided to postpone. I steered clear of every other drugs, excluding occasional alcohol and caffeine. 

Last year, my anxiety was really making me crippled. It was not super intense, but was constant throughout my entire day almost everyday. I was searching for any long-term solutions, that didn't involve pharma medications. During last summer, I realized that I got a chance to source Psilocybin through magic truffles in Netherlands.

\-- Pre-trip preparation --

Starting from a month before the trip, I looked up on the internet about the potential pros and cons of consuming psilocybin, finding every podcasts on this substance and even read some books about the study in Johns Hopkins. After careful consideration, I decided to consume psilocybin, and ask a sober friend to accompany me as a trip sitter for physical safety.

\--Trip Day--

On the day of my trip (pun intended), I went to Netherlands with said friend and purchased 10g of magic truffles, and consumed around 8g on an empty stomach. I ate some potato chips to cover the unpleasant aftertaste, and drank some water.

45 minutes after consumption, I started to notice slight changes in my visual senses, and started seeing vibrations on the grass and repeated patterns of branches on trees. Soon after, my friend suggested me to take a walk, which I complied.

Then, these visual changes continued for another 90 minutes or so. During this time, the visual distortions kept getting stronger, seeing patterns in almost every object. Whenever I looked at the ground, I felt as if I was looking at it with magnifying glasses. I also felt as if I was looking at the world through a 4k television screen. 

At around 2 hours mark, I started to lose my perception of time. Initially, I felt the time was passing extremely slow and extremely fast at the same time. Then after some time passed, I realized that I really lost the track of time, and the concept of time seemed illusionary to me (including the concept of past, present and future).  

At 3-5 hour mark after consumption, I really wanted to find some answers to why I am constantly crippled by anxiety. However, I was unable to focus on any thought. All the thoughts in my head simply appeared and disappeared within seconds. Therefore, I understood it's futile to try to find any answers to my questions. Then, I wanted to talk to my friend, but it was impossible to talk, because I forgot what I was trying to convey to him after 3 seconds. I was hyper aware during this time, noticing every single details in everyday mundane objects, which frankly overwhelmed me.

Soon after, my friend dropped me at my house, and parted ways. I decided to take a shower while I was still tripping. It was probably not a smart idea, as it was very overwhelming to feel every droplets of water on my skin. It was really hard to stop showering. Somehow, I managed to finish showering, and lied on my bed. At this point, I started to regain my sense of time and soberness.

\--Post-Trip Integration--

There are the realizations I had after I reflected on what I experienced during my trip.

1) My thoughts are not who I am. They simply appear and disappear every moments. Thoughts are supposed to help and guide me. But, I am not my thoughts.

2) Human brain takes a lot of shortcuts in its normal/sober state. In some extent, sober brain hallucinates to fill any gaps in our everyday perceptions. A trivial example would be an optical illusion, but our brains take so many shortcuts most people cannot fathom.

3) I clinged to an idea of me. It probably resonates with a lot of people. Almost all people feel they have to become a certain character to fit in a society, family: lawyer, carpenter, student, father, mother etc. The bottom line is that most of us have an idea of who we are, or who we should become. I realized that these are just roles we play, not who we are on a fundamental level, a **pure consciousness.**

4) Most of us, either consciously or subconsciously, believe that our perception is reality. But, my psychedelic trip helped me feel that my 5 senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste) were simply information or content in my consciousness. What we know as ""real world"" could be a simulation or a dream. I already knew these in an intellectual level, but this time I know it on an experiential level.

\--Effects on my psyche--

On the upside, It reduced my anxiety significantly, and made me more grounded. I feel it's now much easier to express myself clearly on a social setting or during arguments/confrontations. 

However, I feel it decreased my emotional reactions to everything, including bad and good events. Now, I tend to remain calm in both good and bad times, making me more **stoic,** so to speak.

 \--Conclusion--

I actually wanted to write a psilocybin trip report, just a day or week after my trip. But, I decided to postpone writing to allow more integration into my psyche. Overall, it was a meaningful experience to me, and it reduced my constant anxiety drastically. 

However, I feel I have to go deeper into psychedelic world to really change my life to what I would love to have. Perhaps one or two high doses (hopefully under professional or Buddhist/semi-religious setting) would be enough, I think.

If you have read this far, thank you and I hope it helped you to gain some information on psilocybin. If you want to reach out to me, feel free to DM me :D.",39,6170,6,1075,1

2023-06-02 21:13:24,Wtf did my spouse give me?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Bear with me, I woke up and have double/triple vision. But I‚Äôm pissed off and would like your opinions before I flip out on my husband. 
Quick background, I (35 F) don‚Äôt have experience with psychedelics. Or any other drugs besides X and weed when I was younger. My (40) husband does. And a majority of other drugs. He‚Äôs not a heavy user but has always been willing to take drugs if they are offered or he‚Äôs been able to get them. He‚Äôs always wanted me to join him when he‚Äôs taking something but I usually decline. Psychedelics are especially off limits for me right now. I appreciate their benefits and the positives they can have for people, but I‚Äôm dealing with past trauma issues and in therapy ATM and don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm in the right mindset to experiment with psychedelics. My husband knows this. He‚Äôs more than aware I‚Äôm not interested in doing them right now. Yesterday he brought home some X. Told me his good friend had it and he bought some. And said friend is an experienced and responsible user of psychedelics and other drugs. And vouched for this X. I‚Äôve done X before and enjoyed it. Nice body buzz and all the feel good feelings with an energy boost. It was great. Friend said that is what he has experienced with this X several times. Last night husband gave me a capsule and said he just took his, I take mine and tell him I‚Äôm going to shower knowing i have a little bit of time before it kicks in. I didn‚Äôt even make it in to the bathroom before my vision starts going into geometric shapes/octagons. I could tell what everything was, but it was all octagons. I walk back into the room ask my husband ‚ÄúWtf is this??‚Äù While simultaneously starting to rip my clothes off bc I started to sweat and was so hot I had to get my clothes off. I laid down and all I remember is waking up on and off seeing my husband sitting next to me on his phone, scrolling and totally unaffected‚Ä¶. Waking up again and asking him to get me water and waking up again this morning with my vision still blurrry and seeing double and triple. I‚Äôve accused him of giving me something else without my consent. He claims he didn‚Äôt do that and he also had the visuals and just laid down bc he knows what to do if stuff starts going wrong on drugs. But was also prepared to call rescue for both of us if needed. I don‚Äôt believe him. I‚Äôm pissed off. I feel very betrayed. I think he was more than aware of what he gave me and did so with malicious intent. I‚Äôm not going to write a book on the reasons why I think he‚Äôs capable of doing that, just trust me that he is. So what say you Reddit? What do you think I took? Malicious set up by my husband or just a bad reaction and inexperience?

ETA: the dealer is a personal friend of ours that we‚Äôve known for years. He‚Äôs into drugs. And also a chemist. So no joke.. he makes a lot of his own stuff. He‚Äôs his own tester. He‚Äôs responsible. Follows all precautions and knows exactly what he‚Äôs giving his friends bc he takes it first. And not just once. He told me he takes a batch at least 3 times before he gives it to anyone else. I absolutely trust the ‚Äúdealer‚Äù. 
I don‚Äôt trust my husband in the sense that because he‚Äôs had great experiences with a drug and believes it has a therapeutic effect on the ppl that take it, if he thought I would enjoy it or it would benefit me, I can see him giving it to me with my knowledge. I‚Äôve told him before that‚Äôs a major abuse of trust and never ever OK for him to do. 
I don‚Äôt feel like he took what I did.. how is he watching me and essentially trip sitting, if he‚Äôs on the same stuff? 
He‚Äôs called the dealer/friend but left the room to have a conversation. That makes me incredibly suspicious. I believe it‚Äôs bc our friend would absolutely say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what I gave you.‚Äù But I could just be incredibly pissed off about it still.
I‚Äôm not letting this go. I will get to the bottom of it. And I will update this post.",26,3923,6,753,1

2023-06-02 19:16:49,Anybody listen to jazz or classical music when they trip?,"I know we all like Pink Floyd, some of us like Grateful Dead, others like newer stuff like psych-bass or psych trance but I don't think I've ever heard anyone talking about jazz or classical music here. I'm sure you're out there, why so quiet? What your favorite jazz / classical stuff to listen to? 


I remember many years ago when i was like 17, dropping acid with a buddy and listening to his dad's record collection. Mozart, Tchaikovsky, and the Dave Brubeck quartet blew my mind. My perspective of music changed forever. These formerly obscure genres finally clicked for me and I started learning jazz and classical guitar, formed a prog rock band etc and the next 5 years of my life were pretty much determined by this trip. 


At one point my band and I went to see the symphony orchestra doing some Beethoven pieces, on a tab of acid, (bonus: I had 40cm of mohawk fully spiked lol)


Don't get me wrong, I love my Pink Floyd but jazz and classical can really hit the spot too. Give it a shot if you haven't. Maybe seasoned listeners can drop some recs below üëá

2023-06-02 19:00:42,üßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Benefits of Solitude üïâÔ∏è,"In depression solitude can be overwhelming but it is the same solitude that helps saints and mystics realize their oneness with the divine. Through out my life I have always been alone. As a single child and an introvert I have realized, through suffering and contemplating upon the scriptures, I am the Solitude itself experiencing the aloneness through the physical body and mind.

Deleting all my social media accounts further deepened my esoteric understanding of solitude.

It is only solitude that will help you to understand the occult studies like Astrology and holistic philosophies of the world.

Solitude helps your mind by removing the ""key"" from the ""monkey"" as solitude itself becomes the ""key"" to unlock the ""monk's"" mind.

Two of my favourite verses from the scriptures for you to help turn the depressive solitude to meditative solitude:

- AparokshƒÅnubhuti verse 24

Translated:
I am verily Brahman, being equanimous, quiescent, and by nature absolute Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss. I am not the body which is non-existence itself. This is called true Knowledge by the wise.

Explained:
Brahman is the ultimate reality that is you, me and everyone and else. Our real nature is that of Existence itself, Consciousness itself, Bliss itself. These are not external emotions felt in the mind alone. But we are IT. We cannot be this body as body is degrading all the time. Which one are you in the changing nature of the body? The child? The adult? Or the old? You cannot be all of them at once. If you can be all of them then you should not be changing. But despite all the changes you still say it ""I am this body"". Enquire deeper and you will find that the ""I"" is different from the body and mind. This way of self-enquiry is called to be the thinking of the wise. üïâÔ∏è

Yeshua said:
If you do not fast from the world,
you will not find the Kingdom.
 If you do not celebrate the Sabbath as a Sabbath,
 you will not know the Father.

- Gospel of Thomas Logion 27

Explained:
This is a good saying by Jesus regarding solitude. To fast from the world is to manifest our freedom in relation to it. We
 must leave the city in order to see its real skyline. A time of retreat is necessary for a truly human life. This also includes going away from social media and too much socialising in modern terms. This is the deep meaning of shabbat, a word
 which literally means ‚Äúa stopping.‚Äù (When contemporary Israelis needed a
 word for a labor strike, they coined the word chevita, a derivative of shabbat.)
. The importance of Shabbat to the Jewish people is well known. Each
 week, individuals stop doing and thereby wrest away the world and
 human life from the iron, mechanical grip of production. People take the
 time to be, to sit before God.
 This is also a day when humans are equal. They drop their social and
 professional roles and are simply human beings. Their universal family, all
 members of which are descendants from God, allows them also to discover this same movement as a kinship with all creatures.
 To bring Shabbat into our life is to introduce a time of stopping and
 of returning‚Äîeven in the midst of our agitated state‚Äîto our essential
 being. It means taking the time to ask the great questions, such as ‚ÄúWhat
 is the real motive of my action? Who is it who thinks? Who am I?‚Äù
 The Shabbat is also a moment of halting our churning mental appara-tus, when time is suspended . . . Then it is possible for a flame to burn from
 the heart of humanity, an echo of the pure and simple I AM which is our real nature as Brahman  (refer to the first verse). üïâÔ∏è",29,3717,5,650,1
2023-06-02 18:44:29,I saw this on a trip,"The timeline:

2024: Developing international crisis, war starts to erupt. It seems that activation of the nuclear arsenals is inevitable.

5.13.24 (May 13, 2024): Nukes go flying. But amidst them, the U.S. has developed an antimatter bomb in secret, which gets dropped on Russia. But this antimatter bomb isn't normal. It's an antimatter bomb, using antimatter to react with normal matter, releasing very large quantities of energy. A half gram can create a Hiroshima.

Of course, you'll have the typical perils of nuclear war. Near-complete destruction of all participant nations, as well as radiation and nuclear winter affecting even the countries that didn't participate. But the antimatter bomb will introduce another aspect completely. The large amounts of antimatter that react with normal matter will tear a hole in this plane of existence.

The rigidity of our plane of existence will lessen, and the very laws of nature will change. We used to have ""magic"" (Back then, perfectly explainable by science) when our plane was more fluid. Hence why every culture has some folklore about magical creatures and magicians. But as time went on, our plane hardened and this stuff became less possible. Occasionally, paranormal and supernatural occurrences happen, due to small fluctuations in our fluidity caused by interactions with other planes. But, it'll come back in full when the antimatter bomb stretches out our reality again. Beings from other planes of existence will rush through, and new ones will rapidly evolve on Earth due to the loosened laws of nature. Once again, these monsters existed long ago, but went away, hence why we have folklore about vampires and zombies and whatnot.

It'll be the end of human civilization and possible human extinction. I personally know that I survive until 5 AAB (After Antimatter Bomb). I have been hiding out in a large bunker in Stockholm until now, the above ground overrun by dangerous creatures. But a group of ""Hyperboreans'' (large 11ft tall humanoids) armed with crossbows penetrates the bunker and kills everyone inside on 8.21.29 (August 21st, 2029). That is the end of my story, and humans story. The last human stronghold in the Congo falls in 2038. After that, wild humans will be one of the creatures roaming a now lawless Earth.

In due time, non humans will take over the ashes of our civilization and rebuild it better, without the intrinsic sins of humans that were our downfall. This could happen by 250 AAB/2274 AD at the earliest, after the radiation and nuclear winter has subsided. For sure, by 2500 AAB/4524 AD, another non-human civilization will have begun to rise. Maybe we were a failed experiment and this is all for the best. Maybe we were just a step in the evolution of sapience.

Or maybe it's a false vision meant to trick me. I know of another plane of existence similar to our own where this was supposed to happen in 2021, but never panned out. Depending on your perspective, this possibility that it might not happen is good or bad. Depends on who you are.

2023-06-02 08:51:26,Trying to clarify things about fresh truffles/dried shrooms equivalence with maths,"So:

As it's said in:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/psilocybin
1g of dried Psilocybe Cubensis mushrooms has 10-12 mg of psilocybine. Let's say 11mg.

In https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22887928/ is said that ""The content of psilocybin was found to vary over a concentration range of 59.3 to 167.8 ¬µg per 100 mg of fresh sclerotia"". 
(59.3+167.8)/2=113.55¬µg as an average per 100mg of fresh truffles

If 100  - 113.55, Let's calculate 1000 - X

113.55‚Ä¢1000/100=1135.5
Fresh truffles have 1135.5¬µg of psilocybine per gram, so it is 1.13mg per gram.

If 1g of dried shrooms is 11mg and 1g of fresh truffles is 1.13mg

We can divide 11/1.13=9.7
And it means that theorically and taking into account all what has been said 1gram of cubensis is equivalent to 9.7grams of fresh truffles.

If we use a calculator like this: 
https://www.zamnesia.es/calculadora-dosis-setas-magicas

2023-06-02 00:44:24,What's your sin?,"Now when I say sin I'm not referring to the Christian version exclusively (but it is part of it), I'm referring to the definition of sin as: ""Knowing natural law but ignoring it"". Natural law being ""As above so Below"", the ""law of polarity"", the ""law of vibration"", etc. This definition ties into the Christian version imo. It's all connected, the natural laws are just more fundamental/esoteric but very real.

I'll start off with mine: Lust/Gluttony. I know that indulging or over indulging in lustful thoughts/beliefs/actions can and will backfire on me but it's very hard for me not to indulge relatively often, no matter how well versed I get on the subject. 

I know there will be repercussions yet I still continue to ignore that fact almost weekly. It seems to be an ""overconsumption complex"" of sorts for me. I just feel highly compelled sometimes to look at porn, eye that nice booty up ahead when I'm out and about (and of course the other few booties I saw later on), or eat the ice cream I know I don't need. OR take that drug a little too often. If I don't take a serious step back I WILL INDULGE.. like a child. I have to keep myself reigned in almost constantly.

This even manifests as dating women I see no future with when what I really want is love and trust. Just... Greed.. Lust.

&#x200B;

I feel that psychedelics have a great way of showing us some of our destructive habits. They seem to, if used correctly, really break down a lot of mental barriers for most people and let you see what's REALLY going on: in your mind, and out in the world. Specifically psilocybin in my experience. If not immediately, in the integration phase days, weeks, or months later.

This wasn't any kind of big psychedelic revelation or anything but psychedelics in general have led me to this self knowledge. It's my main vice. So what's your vice? Do you experience anything similar?

P.S.   I suppose this is a confessional of sorts. Hopefully this post is a good place for some to ""spill the beans"" and relate to each other.. no one's perfect. 

I offer this place as (hopefully) a place free of judgment. For you shouldn't even judge yourself. Accept yourself. Flaws and all. 

And maybe a place for debate. 

Agree or disagree with my point of view? Let me know in comments. Thanks for reading!

2023-06-01 12:11:41,What too much penis envy can do,"This happened about three or four years ago now. Was reminded of it and thought I'd share again. This post is about a friend of mine who took too much of the most potent mushroom known to man. There are some things that were probably forgotten about or accidentally left out, it's been a minute, but nonetheless here is my friend's experience.

One night I came home from a long shift at work to find my roommate tripping sack on mushrooms. That in particular wasn't the issue, but he was in a sleeping bag on the floor when my other roommate walked over to him and was just checking on him. He said ""Let me see your hand"" because we were going to get him out of the bag. He just smiled weirdly and looked at him. So he decided to reach in and grab his hands to move him. As soon as he grabbed his hand a look came over his face of ""No you fucking didn't"". And yes he fucking did.

He shit, naked all inside the sleeping bag and was playing with it, and my other roommate just grabbed his hands. We all realized how out of it he really was, which for him is saying something. So we decide to leave him in the bag and try to move him to the shower. When we make it to the door to the bathroom we tell him to drop the sleeping bag and he was greatly offended by this and started to get really confused. Out of nowhere, he says ""I have to pee"". So we tell him to go pee then, pointing at the toilet.

He proceeds to piss in the sleeping bag, standing up. At this point, we just shove him in the bathroom and I took the role of getting him in the shower. Once he was finally in I turn the warm water on and tell him to clean up. He starts humming and singing while moving back and forth slightly. I decided to let him just soak. Right as I was leaving the bathroom I told him ""Do not touch this knob"", as I feared he may not realize how hot the water is. Before I can say anything else he grabs his dick and begins to masturbate. I yelled at him and he looked shocked. Like everything was fine and had no idea why I was so upset.

We finally get him to clean up and I leave the bathroom. While he was showering I hear him talking and he kept saying ""I'm so glad I'm back guys, it's good to be back"" and just kept singing. When he got out of the shower it was like a light switch in his brain or something and he was totally back to normal. He kept apologizing saying it felt like a dream that he couldn't remember much of. He was literally mind-blown you could tell by the way he looked. He took a nap and told us the rest of the story which happened while I was at work.

He looked at a painting on the wall of our friend and thought it was Jesus, and at the time he thought that meant the end of the world I guess. So he casually got naked. One of our friends showed up before I got home that night and apparently, he tried to make some sexual advances on him. To the point where he had to put him in a sleeper hold... no one is mad or anything we actually look back and laugh at the whole thing. He learned to tread lightly on the mushrooms after that.",31,3051,7,615,1

Nothing helps. The hospital helped but as soon as she got out the problems (her family) came back and she was just as miserable and suicidal.

She‚Äôs also been told she has schizophrenia but it seems to be more of a triggered response to toxic family members. My trust in the mental health care system/profession is almost zero at this point based on how they diagnosed her and after wrestling with the same conditions, minus the schizophrenia I just don‚Äôt know if any of these people know what the fuck they‚Äôre talking about. Nothing helped me until I found psychedelics and then it was like a switch was hit in my brain and I had peace.

She‚Äôs talked to me about trying mushrooms and has microdosed with me several times and it helped. Her problem seems to stem from the fact that her family is toxic and like to dump their problems on her and no matter how hard she tries, she lets their problems become her problems and eventually it just overwhelms her to the point she has a break down. 

One night while we were hanging out her dad called her and said a bunch of super shitty things to her‚Ä¶ she was triggered HARD and ended up regressing to her child self. She didn‚Äôt recognize me or her own mother. She didn‚Äôt know where she was and she didn‚Äôt understand why she suddenly had tattoos and started trying to wipe them off and scream.

I see the world as non-dual now, no separate self-called 'me,' and spend hours of my days sitting quietly in contemplation.

2023-06-01 01:18:16,"Stabilize first, the lunacy of desires on autopilot, my questions are getting better ... and other thoughts, six months in","I was planning a psilocybin trip a couple of weeks ago when my luck ran out on the Covid front, so I've had a fair amount of time (as I continue to enjoy the long tail despite four jabs) to collect my thoughts on practical changes and improvements I've experienced since starting this journey.

For perspective, I got out of my last damn-near-quarterly (since leaving my erstwhile profession a month before the 'rona shut things down) detox Memorial Day of last year and started the job I'm soon due my first annual raise from three weeks later. I'd been actively considering shrooms for the usual mental-health reasons at least a year earlier, but at no point was I stable enough to embark upon the full process of producing fruits (supplies procured around Labor Day last year, first trip Dec. 15).

I want to be explicit about the importance of that stability. Fuck. Were I the sort of person to know someone with whom to engage in commerce regarding the finished product, it would have been an abject disaster in the mental state I was in to attempt such folly.

Since the visuals and entity interactions are by their nature ineffable, I leave that impossible conversation to others and instead want to focus on my main takeaways, as well as why it feels like I've taken an unexpectedly clinical, deterministic path to what seems like the woo-woo hippie clich√© in many regards. Integration remains an ongoing project (one YouTube channel that seems to address much of this from an angle that aligns with my experiences and isn't at all sensationalized is [ZDoggMD](https://www.youtube.com/@ZDoggMD)).

I don't feel as though I've had a smack-to-the-face epiphany at any point, more of an alternating series of penetrating insights into the obvious and unexpected corollaries.

The shrooms often feel like they're going full-on Socratic method ... ask a question, get an interrogative answer to a completely different question, connected only by a seemingly insignificant thread of intent, that then allows the real questioning to begin.

The tapestry so far centers heavily on the fact that it's impossible to progress anywhere without at least one active goal. I differentiate here from passive goals that feel active on account of their ossified strata. Basically, what I want today can't just be a carbon copy of what I wanted yesterday and also be true to my current needs and wants.

That's a fine short-term (think weeks) hack to avoid tedious daily second-guessing, but for me, weeks became months became years. A dark joke I made *for years* well ahead of being able to do anything about it was that things were perpetually going to be better in six weeks. Throughout two failed marriages in a dying career, my world became a bubble of three months with *now* as the center and six weeks ago being the dawn of the epoch.

On its surface, this much should be obvious. So, congratulations for never having navigated the full milieu of mid- to late-stage alcoholism.

Indeed, I'm not sure this is a situation nonaddicts find themselves in at any point in life. And I don't just mean substance addicts ... archetype seeking was a huge problem for me because of the inherent recursion. Damn all the data, stick with your career!

I ended up vacuously satisfied to the extent that I was. I had everything I dreamed of when I was 19. At 35. Which was nine years ago.

This is a good spot to insert what may be a controversial opinion: I don't think trauma processing as such is a healthy goal for a trip, and I have a few reasons for this as someone for whom that was a central goal. Primarily, the sole action that I can take for the rest of my life regarding the violations I was on the receiving end of as a child is not to perpetuate the behaviour. There were no realistic alternate courses of action to avoid the predation and no way to comprehend it at the time. It simply is and is therefore not in need of fresh exhumation.

This also removes a crutch, which never feels good.

But here, I run into a vexing problem on an important line of inquiry: What do I want? And here, I'm actually looking at the narrower ""to do"" aspect over ""to have,"" as having has an endpoint where it falls off the list once satisfied (usually replaced with another iteration aspirationally) and is with vanishingly rare exceptions exclusively the result of external factors.

Gather 'round the campfire as I regale you well past dawn with the rich and vibrant world of what I do *not* want. As for what I do? Cut to a minimalist panel of a room with a single lightbulb operated by a pullchain.

In a desperate search for signal that yields only noise, the noise itself has become interesting as I try to source it and piece together its lineage.

But, man, you get down to stuff like ""and, as someone who was childfree since adolescence, why would a mortgage on a three-bedroom house make sense as a goal in the first place given the already prescient science on climate change during my formative years?""

Scenarios so absurd for deeply held aspects of the definition of success abound, and here, via critical analysis, you pretty much end up at basic thoughts like ""why are we all putting up with ..."" *gestures broadly ""...* this?""

Which gets me nowhere on what I want to do, sadly. It feels like my intent is locked away with the source of perceived self, and the closest I can come to understanding it is to recognize everything I can that is misaligned and keep altering course accordingly.

Not exactly what I expected at the outset, even if my current position feels like there are stereotypes with psychedelics for good reason.",122,5628,20,984,1
2023-06-01 00:14:22,Flipping,"I had heard of the hippie flip but I was not aware that there was so many types of flips. I read this blog post today about the description of 10 different flips. I am curious if people have found the combinations much better than just taking the medicine alone. Appreciate your comments, here is the post I read that I thought was a really good explanation of the different combinations:

2023-06-01 00:02:53,What could any of this mean?,"This is a story about what I went through after taking 250mg of delta-8. I‚Äôm trying to find out the signifigance, if there is any, and what it could potentially mean. Also, tips on how to NOT go through this again, or at least mitigate the chances of such a thing happening again are quite welcome

 It started out with me taking 250mg of delta-8 after a long day at work. I‚Äôd never gone that high before, highest dose I‚Äôd taken was 25mg. It started out normally, but then it got progressively worse. I could tell things were getting weird when I turned on ‚ÄúThe Offering‚Äù by Sleep Token and I started to hear angleic choirs in the background that slowly started getting louder and louder until they overpowered the entire song. I turned the song off, because it was freaking me out, and instead started scrolling Twitter. While I was scrolling through Twitter, a green eye popped up on my phone and blinked at me. When that happened I threw my phone across my bed and started freaking out even more. By this point I could barely get up, my whole body felt like jello. My heart started beating really fast, so I tried to calm myself down by playing another song called ‚ÄúSeraph 1‚Äù by How To Disappear Completely. Big. Mistake. 20 seconds into the song and I had fallen into a trance-like state staring off into nothing while two voices in my head, one mine, the other some entity, were talking. I don‚Äôt remember much of what we said to each other, but I remember the phrase I kept repeating; ‚ÄúI talked to god.‚Äù The voices sounded ethereal, floaty, and whispery. Surprisingly kind of high pitched too. I was stuck in that trance-like state for five minutes or so, and when I broke out of it, I had another voice instantly take over and start screaming and shouting in my head, telling me to claw my eyes out. I threw myself back on my bed when the demonic voice stopped, and suddenly eyes started appearing into everything. My chair, the wall, my overhead light, everything. When I focused on a singular point, I would be sent down a spinning tunnel with pyramids that had eyes on them. And then at some point, the repeating happened. I would wake up in my bed, say ‚ÄúNo no no wait wait wait wait I don‚Äôt like anything about this‚Äù over and over and over again,repeating the same movement pattern, speech pattern, everything. I must have repeated that a few times, then realized i needed to get my dad, but I ws ashamed of the state I was in, so I left my room, paced around the kitchen for ten to 15 minutes thinking the same thing, and when I finally worked up the courageto talk to him, I broke down at that point. I started begging on my knees for him to call 911, repeating over and over again how I‚Äôm ‚Äúhaving a bad trip and I don‚Äôt like anything about this‚Äù for some reason that phrase triggered something in me and like a robot I started moving the exact same way I did in my room, same pattern same everything. He broke me out of it for a bit, and I started to raise my voice at him. We went outside for a walk, which was a bad idea. I ran ahead of him a lot, screaming and whatnot. Every time I remembered ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like anything about this‚Äù I would revert like a robot. My dad kept repeating the same thing to me as well. It was like I relived the same moments over and over again. We got back and I woke my mom up, and she finally called 911. When they arrived, the same stuff kept happening. They kept repeating what they were saying, and we wouldn‚Äôt get anywhere. Finally I got onto the ambulance and they drove off, but I relived that ambulance ride several times as well. We got to the hospital and I relived going throughbthe front doors and hallways and whatnot, I relived vomiting on myself, I relived the IV getting put into me. I finally fell asleep and the trip was over by the time I woke up. Feel free to leave any questions below!",28,3848,6,724,1
2023-05-31 23:52:29,Corporate Embrace of Psychedelics‚Ä¶,"Anyone else suspicious of how major corporations have (over the past 5 years or so) suddenly fully embraced psychedelics? Seeing how the legalization effort became not only extremely corporatized, but how these companies jacked up the THC concentration- resulting in significant increases in anxiety and psychosis when previously weed hardly triggered either- it makes me very wary of mushrooms and other substances becoming legalized as well.

And if we want to go full tin foil hat‚Ä¶ we know the CIA experimented heavily with psychedelics and mind control experiments way back in the 50-60s (and that‚Äôs just what we know about) so how should the psychedelic community feel about the ruling class suddenly changing their tune and going going all in on such powerful mind altering substances?

2023-05-31 23:44:29,Fireside Project is a fucking joke.,"I had the brave idea of Ingesting 7gs of shrooms a while back solo in my apartment. Everything was going great until my AirPods made that ‚Äúpower down‚Äù sound which sent me into a a doom spiral of extenstial crisis to the maximum level. 

I had heard of fireside project so I quickly grabbed my phone and for the next 15 minutes appeared to be a chimp trying to solve a rubia cube.

When I finally was connected I was met with a Indian? Sounding woman. Clearly they are out sourcing these workers. She had no I idea what the fuck she was doing or I what I wanted. And it took me about 15 minutes to connect( I‚Äôm sure the shroom had 75% to do with this).

After I‚Äôm finally connected I‚Äôm baffled to hear a woman with a think Ebonics accent to what appears to be eating chips on the other side of the line. 

I explain to her ‚ÄúI ate about 7 o 8 grams

2023-05-31 23:27:07,i am 100% certain i experienced the worst thing imaginable AMA,"long story short so i (21M) can add context. i overdosed (by accident) on shrooms. it was my first time taking any drugs other than weed. and i‚Äôve only ever done edibles. never plan smoking anything for my whole life. but what i experienced was worse than any hell you can imagine. i guarantee it. 

last week marked a year since it happened. at first i had no memory of the event after first coming back to reality. a week later i took a weed edible and i experienced my first ever panic attack of my life. the first memory of what i experienced came back to me and i had a miniature shroom trip on weed. i struggled through ptsd and panic attacks  daily for months following the event. i eventually had to move back in with my parents because it got so bad. 

last week i tried a weed edible for the first time in a year since the event. and i experienced another shroom trip and multiple memories i had never recovered came back to me as i fell into my first panic attack since last october. i‚Äôve realized i am not capable of taking drugs probably for the rest of my life because of how traumatic the event was. which is a positive thing.

my memories are still suppressed. i only have panic attacks when i remember what i experienced. i remember some things but i really have to dig to recall the worst parts. 

i think about it for about 5 total hours every day. it‚Äôs not my decision to think about it. i could care less. but every and anything reminds me of it. luckily the number has gone down as when it first happened and the following months i spent around 10 hours a day thinking about it.

2023-05-31 22:18:43,Longshot Question,"So, I am decidedly *not* a psychonaut. Brain's entirely too fragile, I don't dare jostle it with anything stronger than shatter or navy gin. But I did have an experience in high school I've been trying to figure out for years, and I think y'all would know.

I'll set the stage. 14 years of age, few weeks before 15. Was heading out to smoke a bowl on my lunch like the young hooligans I was, lol, but the weed I smoked was clearly laced with some shit. I don't remember what the weed tasted like, and I only remember it as looking like a pre-legalization bag of shake, but when I took that hit and went to my fourth period English things got *weird.* I began to feel pretty fuckin' nice, and things started getting geometric in monochrome. It was basically just black and white and grey geometry for a bit before the signal fuzzed back into focus and I was in my old middle school. It was exceptionally realistic. I heard announcements at the times I remembered hearing them throughout the years, I heard kids playing outside and saw them on the playground, I could see the trees blowing in the wind. This went on until the last fifteen minutes of class (it was a 50 minute class since that was the division at my school), at which point I came down and realized that what I'd just smoked was *not* standard Mary Jane. She ain't got moonshine for pussy juice; something was up.

It's been years and I've been fucked up since. It feels like my last semblance of self disappeared at that point, and since then life has been a mess I only keep together through a frankly impressive amount of willpower and array of coping strategies. I've had visual snow and general vision fuzziness since as well.

That's my experience. I figured a community of psychonauts might be able to fingerprint what was in my weed, lol. I was a regular smoker by that point, btw, so my tolerance wasn't exactly miniscule.

If you've made it to here then... thanks. :]",17,1941,2,355,1

2023-05-31 20:31:22,How many months without weed to enter that psychedlic state after some heavy use?,"I used to do weed edibles a few times every 3-6 months, which would give me what weed really is supposed to give you.

The psychedlic magic (what I'll call I guess) has left the first month during heavy use. Came back again for a little after a 3 month break. 

Not sure how many months off weed I should take now to regain the psychedlic magic of weed. Anyone with experience care to share? I'm thinking it should be quiet some time but no longer than a year.

I never judge people that drink or do any other pharmaceuticals that are ""allowed"", so why are they all so judgy when I'm quite open with who I am

Here's the interesting thing. When I did the MDMA I was listening to a Tame Impala song, *Breathe Deeper.* One of the lyrics to this song was ""if you're feeling what I'm feeling, believe me, I am"".

When I heard this lyric, I immediately thought that one of my friends, Anthony, who I had a crush on, was telepathically communicating with me. 

The ""if you're feeling what I'm feeling, believe me, I am"" made me think that my friend was trying to telepathically make me fall in love with him. The love of the MDMA combined with the headspace of the LSD and the song made it clear to me that my friend was trying to send a message through this song.

2023-05-31 16:22:14,The brain doesn't finish development at the age of 25.,"Hello, I just stumbled upon yesterday's post about the legal age of use if psychedelics are to become legal someday. I noticed the majority of comments target the age of 25 for some reason, which would probably be a myth that the brain develops until the age of 25. Here is an article explaining it in more depth for those interested; it's about 10 minutes long read.

[https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html](https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html)

 TL:DR, last paragraph from the article 

Perhaps the whole enterprise needs a reframe. It‚Äôs unrealistic to expect people to appreciate all the nuances of neuroscience, and naive to believe that scientific evidence won‚Äôt be weaponized for political purposes. It feels inevitable that people will gravitate toward a neat, simple story that feels intuitively true: We‚Äôre adults at 25. But rather than using that factoid to defend bad decisions, why not use its lessons to reframe youth as an opportunity? As the brain develops in adolescence and early adulthood, it stays open to change; that‚Äôs what allows us to learn. ‚ÄúChildren and adolescents are not broken adults, but rather, they‚Äôre functioning perfectly well for their developmental period,‚Äù Mills said. They‚Äôre exactly where they need to be; the extra malleability in youth prepares us to figure out our surroundings. ‚ÄúThis is the time we‚Äôre learning about our identity, other people, how we fit into the world‚Äîwe need the brain to be malleable,‚Äù she said. And while adolescence is typically a time of big changes, reaching adulthood doesn‚Äôt mean the end of that growth. You can make good or bad decisions at any age; you‚Äôll mature and regress throughout your life. You, like your brain, are endlessly complex, and we‚Äôre so much more than brain scans will ever reveal.",54,1865,10,284,1

What I found was that while the effects became fairly weaker after that first initial trip the intensity did not go any lower throughout the week sometimes even feeling more powerful. then by the end after coming to some profound conclusions it was as if the drug lost all effects completely. It feels like I can still feel it to this day though and whenever I don't sleep for long or I smoke a lot of weed the visuals come rolling back while mentally I constantly feel like I am on the same plain of thought as If I am tripping.

2023-05-31 15:39:44,2CB trip report :),"By far my most favourite and trippy 2cb trip !

took a 20mg pill split in half; so i took the first half and was nervous as id only had around 5 hours sleep and was slightly hungover but was definitely worth it.

The 2cb zoomies as i call them start to kick and me and a bunch friends were listening to good music and kicking around a ball for an hour and it was just blissful and chill, then we took the second half of the pill which is when things got BEAUTIFUL.

i‚Äôve found, since i get overwhelmed in day to day life easily, i find it better to trip on my own when things feel a bit hectic, especially when my friends have a stronger tolerance and will sit in the ‚Äòhype dancing loud music‚Äô state through the whole trip and my tolerance is very low.

So i decided, since we were at our nearest park, to go on a walk and wow just listening to nature and looking at all the trees were so beautiful and crisp it was so serene. A couple of my mates joined me to sit and watch the pond and the ducks and that was so beautiful, just watching the ducks go about their swim.

When looking at the sky it was a bright beautiful blue (despite it actually being rather cloudy) and every tree would sway to music and the leaves flowed so gracefully to the beat. There was also a time earlier in the trip where the whole sky and clouds were geometric, everything fitting perfectly together. 

Once we got back to the house, i was tripping a lot harded than anyone else so i decide to borrow a pair of headphones and sit in someone‚Äôs room on my own.
This was the best decision i ever made.
I just blasted some of my favourite tripping songs and looked at all the trippy art on his wall, it was annoying sometimes cause i could not make out some of the images; it was like the most intense staring contest between me and a piece of paper, mustve looked hilarious to anyone who mightve come in.

As i got into the depth of the trip, i just felt my heart so full with joy and bliss. I never get any closed eye visuals with psychs which we think is my suspected aphantasia but when i closed my eyes and told myself to just give in to the trip i saw myself from a birds eye view lying on the bed and i wasn‚Äôt anxious or anything negative just kind of appreciative of everything ? idk i can‚Äôt describe how many emotions were in me at once.

Coming in and out of my headtrip (?) i could see a tunnel and a white light and i could feel myself slowly going deeper; sadly never got to the end of that tunnel because i think my headspace was not fully in the trip as it was getting late and i was getting more tired.

Before i began to comedown i saw the ceiling of the room slowly change through colours of red and green and blue. The air around my became visible in a way, like the texture of electric clear fog is the only way i can describe it and that was mesmerising to see, like i was conscious of the world around me to the atom.

Overall im so happy for the trip, made me connect with my friends even more and felt that joy for life. With a history of bad trips as well, it was very healing to have the mindset of not fighting a trip and doing what i know is right for me, even if that means being on my own for while.

Also an important message ! Remember to drink water and go for a piss ! I always forget to do these things and that leaves me always with a small UTI and a massive headache, so this is for those who forget these too :)",18,3424,4,682,1

2023-05-31 13:10:39,Flashback at work,"I used mushroom 4 times in my life, once it was 2g, one month later it was 3 grams, some months later 4g and  later 2g, and these were all the times I used any drug, I never used another psychedelic, I never smoked anything, I don't even drink alcohol .

&#x200B;

Now I'm about 3 months without using it, and I'm going through a lot of stress at work, the ones that make you want to cry, a lot of pressure, super tight deadlines, a lot of work, different assignments, a lot of responsibilities and so on.

&#x200B;

Today I was working when I suddenly felt very similar to when I'm on the mushrooms, I felt myself floating, seeing things dancing like waves, objects seeming bigger or smaller depending on when I looked at them, a sudden calm, the distances looking bigger or smaller...

&#x200B;

All this without me having touched any psychedelics, I researched and it seems that there is a phenomenon called ""flashbacks"" and that can be triggered by stressful situations, where the effects of psychedelics occur suddenly even without use, I believe that could have been it.

&#x200B;

If so, I thought it was great, it's like the mushrooms saved me from having a burnout hahaha

2023-05-31 08:55:41,Why do psychedelics have an exaggerated effect on me? Shroom and aya seperate trip reports,"Apologies in advance if this is too dark
 This Saturday I had only 1.2g of APE shrooms, yet it sent me into an extreme, bad trip in which I had strong synesthesia , very intense open eye and closes eye visuals, and a very chaotic headspace. My mind was racing at a million miles per hour, and it felt like I was concurrently having at least 10 streams of thought at once and living in 10 different realities, in at least half of which I was being killed and resurrected over and over again. I unfortunately was sexually assaulted in October, during which my assailant strangled me. I kept getting this intense feeling of being strangled, and accompanying breathlessness, even though this was not happening at the time. I saw his face and it kept morphing into something demonic, and I could feel him assaulting me over and over again. There was a small string connecting me to reality, and according to my partner I was outwardly very calm (with what little grasp I had on reality I was trying my hardest to remain outwardly still given how I freaked out on ayahuasca), but I occasionally said very disturbing things: like talking about suicide and taking my eyes out. Let me repeat, all this happened on only 1.2g APE.


This January, I went on an Ayahuasca retreat and experienced something similar. I had the most disruptive reaction out of the other participants and I didn't even have a booster. At first the experience was very pleasant, but after I started singing,  and was asked to quieten down,  I quickly became aware of how inebriated I was which catalysed an extremely anxious and agitated state as the effects of the medicine strengthened. A highly superstitious person might have thought I was possessed by a demon. I was kicking, screaming, convulsing and growling, and my mind felt as chaotic as my outward appearance. Again, this man who hurt me came into my visions, but this time I heard him apologising and crying. I hallucinate an entire different reality in which I was taken to mental hospital, my job was strangely forgiving and said I could take all the time I needed,  and my family were around me a lot. None of that happened, I was in the ceremony the entire time, no ambulance was called, but it felt so real at the time. Other people had very intense visions,  but no one had the same physical reaction I did , and they all had boosters. 


Needless to say, I will not be revisiting psychedelics any time soon. My partner has asked that I do not do any more recreational drugs at all; I have mdma every 3 months at raves, which I have never had a bad reaction to, 2cb every 2 months, and I have had shrooms twice this year. I think the first time I had shrooms, they were sold to me as APEs but I think they were a different strain because they looked completely different and the effects were a lot more manageable at 1.2g , although perhaps more intense than you would expect from 1.2g of golden teachers. I'm a bit annoyed at the idea of quitting everything, as I already do not drink alcohol or coffee, but maybe the fact that I am so annoyed about it is a sign that I should stop.

I have Adhd and I have had periods of depression where my thoughts have leaned towards psychotic. I do also have a family history of mental illness, my father has bipolar disorder and one of my aunts has been hospitalised for psychotic breakdowns before. I react very badly to weed. I am going to be discussing all of this with my psychotherapist,  but am curious if any of you have similar experiences or could shed some light on what the fck is wrong with my brain.",90,3585,15,654,1

2023-05-31 06:58:43,"Birthday Trip Report: Peyote, Bufo Alvarius, and the power of set/setting","I have been tripping off and on for a very long time. But the universe decided that I was going to go deeper then I've ever gone this time and also fulfill a lifelong dream of tripping in a peyote circle. 

We met up and shared rides out to a retreat in the jungle by a river. It had a large masonry sweat lodge with a wood floor and a fire pit in the middle. And a large area with a fire circle to lay out yoga mats. 

A Huichol indian shaman and his wife presided over the peyote ceremony and a young medical doctor ran the temescal (sweat lodge). 

Lava rocks and wood were stacked up and  set burning. And the shaman told us the Huichol tales of the creation of earth, pachamama, and the sacred blue deer.

Changed into our swimsuits and met at the temescal and the doctor told us about the four doors of the sun. And that we would do the first two doors to start the ceremony and the last two in the morning at sunrise. 

We were told no one was allowed to leave if the covering was over the door. And to put your head close to the floor if it was too hot.

We entered the temescal, first the women and then the men. And they started bringing in the red glowing rocks and placed them in the pit. Covered the door and started throwing water on the rocks.

Each of the four doors lasted about 15 minutes. The covering was raised after the first door and more rocks were brought in and process repeated for the second much hotter door.

Cold refreshing showers awaited us after the temescal and then we met back with the shaman. We were each given a cup of tea made with chopped up peyote. Absolutely the most disgusting thing I have ever drunk. The cactus pieces are slimy and it tastes horrible. (I'll never complain about shrooms again).

Nausea sets in pretty fast but mescaline is a long slow ride. We say on our mats and the shaman, doctor and two other guides talked to us and then we were given a second cup. This one was much more special and was half full of the sludge. Just picture chunky dog vomit. Yeah, like that.

I think comeup started at an hour or so but it was really really mild. Half of us declined the invitation of a third cup. But I had a blast, everyone else laid down and started tripping and I stayed up all night talking to the shaman, doctor and guides.

People would get up and sit by the fire or run for the bathroom to spew(self included) and then they'd go lay back down. And every now and then the shaman would beat a drum and sing.

We stayed out all night under the stars and the shaman got everyone up before dawn and the lava rocks were heated again.

The final temescal was brutally hot and the shower after felt so good. We were all dazed but felt awesome.

Then as a birthday present the doctor and our host pulled me and a 30 something yr old woman off to the side while everyone else got dressed. Last night was her first time tripping.

We both did bufo for the first time! I went first and she later said that she regretted that because watching it is disturbing. I stood in front of my mat with the shaman  on one side and the host on the other. 

He placed a chunk of the bufo in a meth pipe and melted it with a lighter. I exhaled and then slowly drew in as much of the vile vapor as possible. I took a very big hit.

It hits in seconds and they lowered me to the mat and laid me back. Within a minute I had to roll off the mat to spew once again and the whole time I kept repeating thank you, thank you, thank you. It only lasts about 10 minutes, but space and time no longer apply.

And despite two temescal, more crap came out of my skin and I was covered in sweat and now dirt. Whatever it was that came out, I was suddenly covered in flies. 

We both took a final shower and then just stood there with huge smiles on our faces and thousand yard stares. 

I did not see any spirit guides, machine elves or fractals. I didn't see or hear anything at all. I opened up and was touched by God or the Great Spirit or whatever you want to call it. I just know that it was pure, undiluted, unfiltered, undeniable, overpowering, non-judgemental and completely transformative love.",73,4127,11,798,1

I could influence the colors and shapes and movement by varying the pitch and intensity. I seemed to be able to direct the sound into specific parts of my cranium with differing effects. I was very grateful I was in a trailer in the woods far from prying ears.

I don't mean to be sacrilegious. I understand that OM is a sacred syllable, now I might have a wee inkling why. It's motivating me to look more deeply into the practice.

I sprinkle that powdered Enigma goodness into the citric acid concoction, and it starts fizzing like a psychedelic science experiment. üß™üí• Talk about mixing chemistry and spirituality!

With my lemon tek potion ready, I downed it faster than a squirrel stealing nuts, eager to soar into realms unknown. And boy, did it deliver! Within what felt like minutes (time is an illusion, my friends), reality started to ripple and dance around me like an EDM festival on Neptune.

Colors! Oh, the colors! It was like someone turned up the saturation on the universe, making everything vibrant and alive. The walls breathed in rhythm with my laughter, and even the plants seemed to nod in approval of my audacious spirit.

But hold on tight, because things took a turn for the absurd. The very fabric of reality decided to play a prank on me, twisting and contorting in ways that would make Salvador Dal√≠ blush. I found myself swimming through a sea of talking tacos and disco-dancing pineapples. Don't even get me started on the interdimensional conversations I had with a wise-cracking cosmic sloth named Reginald. üåÆüççü¶•

As the trip reached its peak, the boundaries between myself and the universe dissolved. I became one with the cosmic symphony, riding waves of pure euphoria. I understood the secrets of the universe, decoded the meaning of life, and discovered that the answer to everything is... a really good pizza.

But alas, all good trips must come to an end. As the psychedelic rollercoaster gradually slowed down, I found myself back in the familiar realm of our Earthly existence. Reflecting on the journey, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of awe and gratitude for the mind-bending experience that Enigma and the Lemon Tek method delivered.

Now, my fellow adventurers, let me leave you with a word of caution and wisdom. Psychedelics are powerful tools that demand respect and responsibility. Always do your research, know your limits, and create a safe space for exploration. And if you decide to embark on a lemon tek adventure, be prepared for a trip that will blow your mind and shake your soul!

Keep exploring, stay curious, and may your psychedelic voyages be filled with laughter, wonder, and cosmic insights. Happy tripping, fellow cosmic explorers! üöÄ‚ú®üí´

TL;DR: Lemon Tekking 7g of Enigma sent me on a mind-bending journey through talking tacos, dancing pineapples, and interdimensional convos with a cosmic sloth named Reginald. Colors were vibrant, reality played tricks, and I unlocked the secrets of the universe (which turned out to be pizza). Stay safe, stay curious, and happy tripping! üçÑ‚ú®",45,2727,8,452,1

If so, how do you think this is possible? Can we look towards a panpsychism model of the universe or quantum physics / entanglement theory? In chaos magick it is said that ""belief creates reality."" If we have sufficient faith/belief in an experience, is it possible that we're collapsing infinite waves of quantum possibility into physical reality through our observation/perspective?

2023-05-30 22:18:12,I thought .5g of mushrooms was going to be a microdose,"So it's been about ten years since my last trip. It was an extremely intense trip on a heroic dose camping on the top of Lake tahoe. Decided I would start light and eat .5g of dried albino penis envy. Didn't really have a plan going into it as I was expecting to not feel much. Thought I would try to play a video game and listen to music. Ate them at 10:30 and about an hour after ingestion I could start to kind of tell it was kicking in. I had a long day beforehand and was feeling tired, the yawns started kicking in and I couldn't focus on the game. Was a pretty mild feeling though compared to previous experiences. Not sure what the affects were going to be I had setup a uv reactive tapestry with a meditating Chakra figure over a mandala under a ceiling fan and then put one of those skylights that has rotating stars pointed at it. Was a real mood setter lol. Anyway the yawns were getting the best of me and I thought well if this is all it's going to be I'll just lay down with my dog and cats and watch Sweet Tooth on Netflix, had never seen it. That show was a whole vibe and my trip started coming in more than I expected. Ended up peaking for about 2 hours and going on an adventure with this little deer kid. I was loving it but when the show would get a little too intense I would go over to the Chakra setup and sort of recenter myself. Didnt have hardcore visuals but everything was super flowy and the colors were so vivid. The experience lasted around 4 hours before I could finally get to sleep. Overall it was a fun experience but I think I prefer a group setting over solo. Just didn't really know what to do with myself once it really kicked in. Although Gus, Pubba and Jep did a great job of keeping me company lol. Don't know why I felt the need to post but it's good to be back to exploring the other side.

2023-05-30 15:17:24,My post-DMT expierence,"About a year ago I tried DMT for the first time, somewhere around 40mg the first time and then a few days later 80mg. I don‚Äôt remember any visuals and I definitely didn‚Äôt break through. 

The first experience I layered it with some weed in my bong and only got 2 hits in. I endured my very first ego death. I was terrified and fought it with every ounce of myself (which is not a great idea). I threw up several times but eventually I sorted myself out. Everything around me felt off, I knew I was in the same place but it felt so new.

The second time I had vaped it. Again no visuals, open eyed or closed but I had the sensation my face was ‚Äúblooming‚Äù like a flower. Again no breakthrough, and I don‚Äôt recall any feeling like the ego death I had previously. Now a year later, I still smoke weed but haven‚Äôt had any psychedelics since, but weed behave differently now when I go a while without smoking. I want to say I trip again because I get the same feelings and vibrations, I guess, as I did when I was tripping on the DMT. I have maybe 3 or 4 of what I consider ego deaths just from smoking some weed, and I don‚Äôt need a lot of it to feel like I‚Äôm tripping again.

I know weed is psycho active but it feels like I just forget that weed is different for me now and it can cause me some anxiety. There are still times I have the afterglow after a smoke session which I do enjoy, but every once in a while I do have some minor anxiety, though I‚Äôve learned to calm myself fairly quickly.

2023-05-30 13:33:52,The Singularity Within: A Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Universe and Physicality,"In the vast expanse of cosmic mysteries, the universe unfolds before us, beckoning us to delve deeper into its enigmatic nature. Through a synthesis of concepts surrounding singularities, holography, human consciousness, and the fate of the cosmos, a new understanding emerges‚Äîone that challenges conventional thinking and our psychological disposition towards the universe itself. In this article, we embark on a thought-provoking journey, exploring the interconnectedness of these ideas and the profound implications they hold for our perception of physicality and the cosmos.

I. Singularity as the Essence:

At the heart of this paradigm lies the notion that the singularity, often associated with the birth of the universe, encapsulates a profound essence‚Äîan embodiment of all information, knowledge, and potential. Drawing inspiration from the singularity's ability to emit light and the subsequent refractive interactions, we posit that the singularity's splitting into two separate concepts engenders the creation of matter. These particles, imprinted onto the fabric of space-time, become a blueprint, eagerly awaiting reinvigoration.

II. Holography and the Dance of Light:

To comprehend this grand tapestry, we turn to the concept of holography‚Äîan artful interplay of light and perception. Analogous to the holographic process, where patterns of interference give rise to seemingly solid three-dimensional images, the imprint of matter upon the dark energy of the universe evokes a similar phenomenon. The universe becomes a cosmic hologram, a projection of the singularity's inherent patterns upon the vast stage of space-time. The scale of the universe and the energy required to physically encode into dark energy restricts the ability to freely materialize objects.

III. Metacognitive Human Consciousness:

Intriguingly, this paradigm shift extends beyond the cosmic canvas, transcending into the realm of human consciousness. Humans possess a unique capacity for metacognition‚Äîthe ability to self-regulate and move beyond the limitations of external stimuli. Through practices such as meditation and emotional control, individuals can tap into the reflective singularity's energy that currently embues them from within. A unique state may occur in which relativity no longer determines experience. By reflecting the singularity that birthed them, humans stabilize their existence, control emotions, and make decisions, becoming architects of their own reality.

IV. Challenging the Perception of Physicality:

This newfound understanding challenges our preconceived notions of physicality. The interplay of fluctuating light waves and quantum particle behavior reveals an underlying chaos permeating reality. Only when time, intertwined with physicality, records the quantum position of particles, can their specific locations within reality be perceived. Humans, in their unique ability to self-regulate, transcend the limitations imposed by physicality and embrace the metacognitive realm‚Äîan existence influenced by their own light, energy, and conscious choices.

V. A Call for Paradigm Shift:

This holistic framework invites us to reimagine our psychological disposition towards the universe itself. It implores us to shed the limitations of conventional thinking, embracing a mindset that sees the universe as a living entity intertwined with consciousness and potential. By embracing the interconnectedness of singularities, holography, human consciousness, and the fate of the cosmos, we embark on a transformative journey towards a profound and symbiotic relationship with the universe.

Conclusion:

In this exploration of interconnected ideas, we have witnessed a tapestry of cosmic evolution, from the birth of matter to the expansive reaches of the universe. We have contemplated the holographic nature of reality, human consciousness as a reflection of the singularity, and the challenge it poses to our perception of physicality. The new understanding presented in this article encourages us to question, to ponder, and to embrace a profound shift in our psychological disposition towards the universe‚Äîa shift that brings us closer to the singularity within and opens our psychological functioning to the concepts of Quantum entanglement in the form of psychological states, epigenetics, and cognitive processing. By utilizing layers of experience, we can shift between patterns of energy emission, just as in quantum computing, to process and comprehend enourmous amounts of data and information all the while encode it and building it upon itself. But most importantly, we, as humans, have the ability to remove all lenses and become the singularity of experience.",86,4699,12,673,1

He was funny and we clicked from the get go, and even better: he only lived 3 hours from me!! So after 2 weeks of nonstop talking and flirting, and me telling him I have a small crush on him, I take a train to meet with him for the weekend. We go to a party the night I arrive and we each take a low-medium dose of molly. I didn‚Äôt feel much until i redosed , but when I did‚Ä¶ oh my god. He definitely had rolled more than me, I was kind of just chilling. But he was so into me at that moment. He spent the whole party by my side, and once it started to kick in for me, the way he was looking at me, how close he got to my face, and how good it felt to hold his jacket and pull him in, just overcame me. I wanted to kiss him. So badly, I had crazy butterflies. We ended up going home and drinking a little after it wore off, and he was still being so sweet and nice and just‚Ä¶ it seemed like he really liked me back. Next morning his mom makes us breakfast and we spend the whole day together, as he promised he‚Äôd take me on a date. The date was fun, nothing crazy, just spending quality time together. Going to the lake and talking, etc. That night we have sex for the first time and he really reassured my insecurities with that. Then Sunday, before I leave, I word vomit everything to him I‚Äôve felt since I met him, and I tell him I‚Äôd really like to try to be with him. I want him to be my boyfriend. He thinks about it but that makes me anxious (I have anxiety lol) and then he tells me how he feels about me and tells me he‚Äôd like that too. So now we‚Äôre dating, still don‚Äôt know each other that well. He‚Äôs kind of the type of guy to pretend he doesn‚Äôt like you it seems, or maybe he just shows affection differently or needs more time to warm up. Or maybe doesn‚Äôt even feel how I feel, and my hearts gonna be broken. We took it 5 days ago now, I‚Äôm back home now (had the worst separation-induced comedown) and I still can‚Äôt stop thinking about how molly made me fall in love with this man.

2023-05-30 05:35:05,My Worst Acid Trip,"Strap in because I'm about to share my most horrifying trip experience to date, actually most horrifying experience period. Now, I've had my fair share of bad trips, but this one took the cake and shattered my perception of reality. Here's how it all went down:

So, I had this brilliant idea of dropping acid with a friend. Knowing that I've had some rough experiences in the past, I decided to take a relatively low dose of 1.5 tabs, mainly to supervise my newbie friend. Little did I know that this trip would turn into an absolute nightmare.

At first, everything seemed to be going smoothly. The visuals were fading as we reached the end of the trip. But then, I made a fatal mistake‚ÄîI decided to smoke some weed. Within a mere five minutes, the weed hit me like a freight train, catapulting the visuals into a mind-bending frenzy.

The intensity of the visuals was beyond anything I had ever experienced before. It was as if my entire field of vision had been hijacked by some incomprehensible cosmic force. I couldn't even see the room anymore; I was lost in a psychedelic abyss.

Describing what I saw is impossible; it was so unfathomable that I questioned whether I was still on LSD or had accidentally ventured into a Salvia-induced nightmare. The feeling of losing touch with reality was overwhelming‚Äîit felt like being trapped in an unknown, terrifying realm. The closest sensation I can compare it to is the imminent dread of death itself.

In moments of fleeting clarity, I would catch glimpses of my room, but these fragments were quickly devoured by the voracious visuals. Time became a twisted construct as I found myself trapped in endless loops, unable to escape the mind-bending chaos unfolding before me.

But let me tell you, words can't fully convey the sheer horror I experienced. The mind is incapable of comprehending the depths of this trip unless you're living it in real-time. Strangely enough, I later recalled a previous bad trip that I had completely forgotten, realizing that this unfathomable sensation was eerily familiar.

After mustering some semblance of control, I managed to make my way to the kitchen for a glass of water. When I returned to the room, I spiraled into a full-blown psychotic episode, desperately begging my friend to ""turn it all off."" It was as if I had become a broken record, repeating the same plea over and over again.

All of a sudden I froze, unable to speak or move. (In my perspective the visuals took over again) My friend's attempts to communicate with me were unsuccessful; he later said it was as if I was trying to communicate but I was trapped in my body.

He tapped me on the shoulder and out of nowhere, I had what looked like a seizure then blacked out and hit my head. The memories surrounding this moment are hazy at best. I vividly recall teleporting into reality, staring at my friend's face, and hearing a jarring bang before everything went blank.

For the following hours, all I could focus on was my breathing, desperate to prevent the visuals from consuming me once again. I shook uncontrollably, my entire being engulfed in fear. Even after a week had passed, I still couldn't shake off the trauma. The visuals persisted (not cause LSD was still in my system but I guess my brain still scared and just seeing things in the dark and what not), a constant reminder that I had traversed the depths of a bad trip.

For a few daysafter a fear haunted me: what if I was still trapped in the clutches of that horrific experience? What if I was doomed to find myself sitting on my bed, minutes after the ordeal had begun, forever locked in a twisted time loop?

And, if that wasn't enough, even three weeks later, every time I smoked weed I got visuals, making me paranoid and scared.

Im writing this at work, just recalling the incident I feel sick and am slightly shaking, or that could be the fact I've only had a red bull and KitKat today.

TL;DR: Had such a bad acid trip that I had a seizure and blacked out, took weeks to recover, this bad trip put my other bad trips to shame (which I considered the most frightening thing ever st the time)

Then a few bats fly over our heads in the pavilion we‚Äôre in. A little startled but all good. 

THEN, the owner‚Äôs cat comes into the pavilion. It‚Äôs super super friendly and rubbing up on me. I‚Äôm kinda uncomfortable. Then it literally won‚Äôt leave us alone, trying to climb up on the hammock, and staring at us.

It even followed us to our tent when we fell asleep and got under the rain fly and stared at us. TERRIFYING.

This post is entirely hypothetical but based somewhat on empirical evidence, but I also want feedback on the possibility of this.  


This hypothesis is based on a very basic understanding of neuroscience and molecular biology so bear with me here.  
Mushrooms seem to very commonly induce rapid behavioral changes and changes in thinking patterns that can last for extended periods of time. This implies that they cause rapid structural changes in the brain. Most likely, substances such as psychadelics put the brain into a hyper-state of neuroplasticity, allowing for these structural changes. This rapid restructuring then allows for the brain to ""refine"" itself and reduce the prevalence of redundant neural pathways.   


I have seen in the past use that the changes you experience from psychadelics are heavily reliant on what you are doing during the time you use them. I personally found the most benefit from microdosing as I found it led to a recursion loop of changes: I experienced gradual mood-boosting effects which then led to an increased willingness to engage in positive behaviors (such as exercise), and the activities I did were then reinforced further. I still have multiple long-lasting positive changes in my behavior and mindset since that microdosing cycle, which was somewhere around 8 months ago.  


So, my question is. Can you use psychadelics to rapidly learn skills?  


Let's say, for example, you have a lot of time on your hands and you have multiple hours in the day to practice your skill. For this example let's use the ability to play an instrument, perhaps the piano. You would ideally need to gain some familiarity with the skill while sober first, or while microdosing; it is necessary to understand the concepts and skill somewhat competently before engaging in a learning session while under the influence of a psychoactive substance, as learning a completely new concept in this state could potentially be even more difficult than while sober.   


Besides, you need to make effective use of your time and you need to set up the exponential learning curve over the course of a few weeks.  


Anyways, let's say you then take a dose of your psychadelic of choice early in the morning for effective wakefulness; the dose should be as high as you can possibly make it while still maintaining the ability to focus. This would depend on your own ability to focus or concentrate, and your sensitivity. You then spend the majority of the trip practicing with your desired skill, so in the example given you would spend a few hours playing the piano, taking breaks as necessary.  


Could you then accelerate your learning process? What are the implications of this?",119,2765,20,457,1
2023-05-30 00:42:10,LSD Death,"Just wondering if anyone else has been this deep on LSD

2500ug or so, and something goes horribly wrong. Humans are a combination of animals and ""pretenders"" pretending to be them. Everything is cyclic, all behaviors ever. time spirals out forever.  I fall into infinite loops and spend eternity in ""hell"" of a crumbling psyche. Screaming and sobbing and begging and being nobody and everybody. All the sudden, I ran out of ""things"" for there to be, all problems were to be solved by the death of the Universe. I believed I had ""broken"" the laws of physics and ""unstuck"" the plug that was keeping existence from not ""flowing"" with light, by somehow realizing a truth so profound it literally shattered reality. It felt melancholic and sad for a moment, because ""I"" was alone. Meanwhile, in ""real"" (individual) life my mom was in the room tripsitting and she put on Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major. I realized it was emanating from within, like a beam of light passing through the black of space. Each note was the entirety of my being and instead of hopeless, 

I suddenly felt this bliss like I never had to worry again or to even do or be anything again. I just was. I was everyone. This loneliness wasn't hopeless and desolate. It was an illusion like the rest of my finite temporary problems were. And then I was everyone was nothing. Just a dream, created by one singular ""head"". I woke up into an infinite tessellation of lightning-bolt-like ""watchers"" of heaven. As I slowly drifted down from this state, He said ""Only two are impermanent: 'Love' and 'I'. You must Love I""

My first thoughts after seeing I was everything was nothing, were ""so is my life gonna suck in comparison to this?"" and ""what the fuck I'm my own parents?"" and ""shit I gotta call the news station this is a profound discovery. wow. I gotta tell someone. everyone must know.""",9,1852,2,330,1

2023-05-30 00:35:44,"Psychedelic psychosis , schizophrenic fear, and moving forward. Need help.","Hello psychonauts. I'm making this post because I've found myself, again, intrigued and interested in the world of psychedelics, something I swore to myself I'd never try again. Around 7 months ago now I had what I would describe as a nightmare trip on LSD. 

Ever since then I've distanced from just about every substance I previously used. I don't smoke weed anymore, haven't done shrooms, DXM, and certainly not LSD. Before this experience I would use psychedelics somewhat regularly, I'd has two shroom trips which went largely quite well, a few experiences with 4-HO-MET, one of which I took with acid, and was probably the best trip of my life, and a brief DXM escapade. None of these experiences shook me to my core in the way that my nightmare acid trip did.

After my LSD trip I nearly had to go to an inpatient facility to set my mind straight. I attended daily group therapy sessions for 3 weeks straight, which helped, though the therapy I found really had nothing to do with what I was dealing with. I consider myself to have overcome the residual fear and psychosis largely on my own. Going through this has made me consider whether or not I have schizophrenia, as the reality bending thoughts and theories I'd ponder have only heightened in intensity since my psychedelic use. 

From what I've heard schizophrenia ""actuates"" in most people around the ages of 19-21, of which I find myself right in the middle of as I had the nightmare trip at age 19, and am now 20 years old.

I've met with multiple psychiatrists in the time since my trip, and haven't been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I want to trust their judgement considering they're the experts in this field, but I'm hesitant to disregard my fears completely. 

The psychiatrist I most frequently met with diagnosed me with antisocial personality disorder upon first meeting, though since then he's reeled back on this diagnosis, and instead believes I have generalized anxiety disorder, which seems correct to me, though since then my anxiety has faded almost entirely.

I'm making this post to gather some opinions. Psychonauts, in your experience, are you able to relate to what I've experienced? And, if so, were you able to continue using psychedelics after enough time?

2023-05-29 20:41:53,MY EXPERIENCE. does it make sense?,"If the experience is true, then are we all here to find ourselves together, or are some receiving a higher purpose? In all aspects of life, there are hierarchies, nowadays we only think about this in the context that in our biological lives we start at the bottom and work our way up from there. If the experience is true, then it couldn't be further from reality. Does the universe give us a spiritual purpose? It sounds like a foolish question because it would never be possible to answer it. Everything one sees around that reminds one of their goals, is it just a coincidence? I know I'm not the only one who feels that something big awaits me. Or is it perhaps foolish to believe that am i just on the same path as others in search of purpose, or is this deeper? I think that if people had the same experience as I do in life, they would believe me. Those who are faithful have felt that they sometimes receive signs that could be stamped as a coincidence, but there is something that tells them that some higher power has done this for them to remind them that he is with them, helping them, or showing them the right path. But what if he indirectly uses other people to influence the individual he is talking to? It's hard to contain this question let alone explain what I mean by this, but I think this would work like this. If a holy spirit that is omnipotent lives within us, then in theory he would know everything you are going to say or will ever say or think. What if by coincidence you and your friend hang out together and everything he says and does obviously relates to everything you are thinking about, almost as if he's reading your thoughts in some strange and supernatural way, but you can't describe how or why, what it means or how it's happening, is the Holy Spirit working through another person to influence you?",34,1840,6,341,1

I am going to a festive soon and want to do a 2g of Mushrooms. Id like to do 3g (4g in my bedroom was insane)  but want to to be careful. 

I have read you MUST redose before the first hour or your extra dose will just make the trip last longer, not more intense! Is this true?

Earlier this year I consumed a quarter of albino penis envy and had brief ego death. It was terrifying and amazing at the same time. I felt a ""cosmic knock"" on the door of my consciousness, and I opened the door. Inside that door I met a variety of beings - dead family members, winged creatures, and the honeycomb people. When I looked at the honeycomb people, i could see like a grid of hexagons surrounding them, and inside each hexagon was another version of them from a different point in time

Now, every time I take shrooms, it's different than it was. I meditate when i take shrooms, and then i begin to dream. It's like I am lucid dreaming inside my head, but I am awake. I lucid dream often and this is the only comparison I can make. 


I like to meditate when I take shrooms, and eventually I start to ""wake up"" inside a dream. It feels like I am coming out of anesthesia.

It's truly so bizarre I don't even know how to describe it.

I did this on saturday night. I started to wake up in a dream, and it's like I was coming out of the ground, really struggling to bring my ""Astral body""? Into form inside the dream. This caused a bit of a scene in my dream world and attracted the attention of the beings there. A bunch of these beings surrounded me and were trying to help me and encourage me to form in that realm. It's like just my head was popping out of the ground, and I could feel myself struggling to free my arms and legs from the earth, despite lying completely still on my bed. The beings seemed amused.

Oddly enough, I had a very similar lucid dream a week ago while sleeping. I thought of this, and The beings said, ""she remembered!!""

Suddenly, something dark and heavy attached itself to my head/mind. Like one of the flying monkeys from the wizard of Oz. The beings scattered, but one threw himself on top of the dark thing and tried to pull it off. He yelled at me to leave, that it wasn't safe. I pulled myself up from my bed, back to reality, left the room, shut the door, and went to distracted myself by watching TV. For the next 30 minutes, that being who tried to protect me, stayed with me inside my head, to make sure ""nothing followed me back""

2023-05-29 12:57:56,What did I take ??,"I had a trip 2 years ago, and I have been trying to figure out what i had taken. At first I thought it was 25i-NBOME, because that‚Äôs all I could find from Google. It was sold as LSD and had a very bitter taste. I took two of these tabs. I also took 5, 20mg oxycodone. The trip was very stimulating, complete sense of reality and time was lost. It was quite horrific at times but it was also amazing at times. It was very centred around electricity and speed for some reason. According to my mum, I was passed out for about 2 hours and my face had a purple tone to it. This trip lasted 3 days. I did not sleep for 2 nights and slept on third barely. When I was passed out, talking about the things I saw during that time would make me sound schizophrenic.

We have rented a small air bnb cabin by the forest for a few days.

Both have been taken acid several times and feel quite good mentally at the moment.

We definitely want to start with a low dose, like 1 to 2g. I have been growing B+ mushrooms myself, which we will probably consume in a smootie. 

Probably we will consume indoors and then go out. The day before, we want to take a closer look at the area and familiarise ourselves with it.

So so beautiful and full of insights. I experienced ego death at the peak, just laying there in the grass feeling the sunshine. I wasn't in my body anymore. I was floating in this i can only describe as 4th dimensional pulsating geometry. Like it was dancing with me. I had no thoughts whatsoever. No memory, no nothing. Just my awareness and a feeling of oneness.

The afterglow is pretty sweet now the following days. All colors outside are more bright and vivid and all of nature looks much more alive. I can sense the geometry all around me, in the grass and leaves especially.

But i must say it was a tough night. I was so tired and just wanted to sleep. But i couldn't sleep at all. I was up all night. It was super uncomfortable. But i just laid there, letting the acid split my unconscious mind apart. I'm now super happy i was able to let go.

Just wanted to share my first experience, wish all of you great experiences.

2023-05-29 10:45:39,LSD dosing,"When buying on the black market, most LSD is 200,225,250ug. This seems like a LOT for one tab. 100ug tabs are rare and more expensive. 

Some guys even sell 350, 560 & 710ug tabs ($80, $120, $160 for ten tabs). Can you even fit more than 200ug on one tab?

&#x200B;

I will be testing all LSD with a full Reagent pannel but cannot know the dose.   


I bought it from a reputable seller in Holland 10x225ug for $30. I have found a seller in the UK (my country) who sells 10x110ug for $50. So, 30% more cost and 50% less ug per tab, BUT it sounds more realistically priced, and it means not cutting my tab in half.   


Is this the best way to go about buying? If I dose up to 500ug, but it turns out its only 250, then I  use another source, who is dosed right, and make the same trip, I could be in a FUCK tonne of trouble.

2023-05-29 05:34:41,Story / Advice?,"I will describe a part of my life story in relation to substance use and would like to hear your opinion on my ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù and advice. When I was a 14-year-old boy growing up in the Czech Republic, it was common to see everyone around me using alcohol and cigarettes as if they were completely safe substances that couldn't lead to addiction. It was considered normal to smoke a pack of cigarettes and have five beers every day. In this environment, there were two distinct groups of substances: one alcohol and cigarettes, and another for drugs. Drugs are portrayed as the ""bad guys"" that ruin lives and turn people into addicts. So, until I turned 21, I lived in this misconception, perpetuated by the Czech ‚Äúchlastenec"" (booze = chlast, patriot = vlastenec) culture, where the glorification of alcohol is a significant issue.

However, at the age of 21, I began reading about marijuana and its effects, both the positive and negative. Through this exploration, I somehow came to the realization that alcohol was actually much worse. This sparked my curiosity about addiction, substance use, and the general awareness required when consuming any substances. As I grew older (currently 24 years old), I experimented with MDMA (no more than 3-4 times a year), THC, LSD, and Kratom. I never developed a strong addiction to these new substances, but I have continuously struggled with addiction to nicotine and alcohol.

Studying and experimenting with substances other than the two glorified ones made me more aware of the potential risks associated with alcohol. I managed to significantly reduce my alcohol consumption from 30 units per week to a maximum of 5 units per week. Overall, learning about the positive and negative effects of the so-called ""bad"" drugs made me realize the detrimental nature of alcohol. Consequently, I believe that all substances should be approached with caution, utilizing harm reduction techniques, and being primarily responsible.

Many of these realizations about substance use and the potential risks associated with alcohol came through my experiences with LSD. Currently, I engage in microdosing LSD 2-3 times a month, and overall, I have noticed an improvement in my overall well-being in last 3 months.

At the end, I would like to ask for advice on how to cope with the anxiety and judgment I face from being viewed as a ""junkie"" simply because I choose not to excessively consume alcohol.",15,2431,3,401,1

2023-05-29 04:49:39,Thoughts on relationship with myself and others,"I have had a lot of doubts with every relationship I have ever had, and as a result have given up on many relationships, some that looking back I was meant to move on from, but in regards to my most recent one im having a very difficult time, she loves me so much and I love her too, but there is always this voice in my head telling me im not supposed to be with this person.
The thing is I‚Äôve had this voice for a long time, and sometimes it‚Äôs wrong and sometimes it‚Äôs right, and I hate the idea of giving up someone so great if there‚Äôs just something in my subconscious preventing me from embracing the relationship fully. My personal problems are impeding me from becoming fully what im meant to be, and potentially screwing up a great relationship.

Basically I want to take a psychedelic and do it safely and get to the bottom of some things, and either get back with her if that‚Äôs the conclusion or have the insight and resolve to move forward so im not consumed by thoughts and feelings about her constantly.

It is easy for me to attain San Pedro, Peruvian torch, psilocybin, dmt, mdma, cannabis, and even blue lotus, I‚Äôm willing to do any of it and all of it, my main fears are just doing something stupid or becoming a psychedelic casualty lost in schizo or psychosis.

What do you folks reckon I do? I had some real fucked up shit happen in my childhood that frankly im afraid to face, lots of close encounters with death so I have a hard time surrendering, lots of fear based torment, but I want to get to the bottom of it and hopefully have a positive relationship.

2023-05-29 02:11:37,An old post I wrote,"Even if only for a minute, greet your soul. Greet your being. What makes you, you. Feel the pains. The aches. The bruises that keep coming back.


They're familiar and yet so distant. Learn of their existence. Understand the pain, the struggle, the joy, the triumph, that makes you, who you are.


For what is to fear is what we may not comprehend, to release ourselves. To give unconditional love, to yourself. To carry the burden of awareness and understand the effort the body puts forth, so that we may learn how to help it. How we may make our own lives, more simplistic.


What happens, when unconditional love and acceptance of self is allowed to be set free of physicality? When our mind works every day for the sake of our body, our mind may one day learn to accept it's vessel as it is. To accept the body, to balance the mind. A calming and gentle equilibrium radiates in the iridescent glow of a vast field of entropy.

I don't usually share much of what's on my mind, but I think I should more.


I'm scared of what people think of me as I long for social acceptance of my perceptions. I always have been, even since I was a small child. Observant, calculating, integrating. I was reading patterns and trends. I gained fixations, propensities for cognition, bias in my perception of reality, etc. Everyone else did too, but maybe I was just too aware? To self absorbed? Too afraid to be perceived in a way that displeased my own sense of self. A fragility. An inexplicable weakness causing a tendency for self destruction. 


A safety switch, cemented firmly into reality. Vices. Compulsions of various function and pathology. Each serving an individual purpose. What is it? What is the purpose of that which ails you most? What is it that means so much. Why, is it?


May you learn to let it go of its control. To be able to trust that your mind accounts for the needs of your body.",19,1896,5,343,1

A couple weeks ago I took half a tab with my brother, thought it would be a light trip, instead  I really had a strong experience.

Now, to the story:

I was peaking, and in some kind of meditative state, closed my eyes and blindfolded myself with a towel.
I got carried away by the music and had some really intense closed eye visuals, got to see some spiral that went on infinitely, when I looked into it I could see many eyes opening inside, noticed I could see through them, and saw something lile another dimension/world, it was as if I was moving across this dimension, had no body or concepts of anything as to enter this place I just kinda understood that in order to be, I had to stop being.
Saw some mouth creating what I thought was that reality, moving across existence, creating such
Saw millions of eyes in a beautiful place, colorful, infinite, it was as if I was shown lots of things and just after that I could see what I thought was my head, it was grid and it was glowing in millions of colors inside, when I took a peek I felt like I was a drop of water, made of colors and I fell into my body, saw tubes in my body filling up in colors and when it was full I came back.
After that I was stunned, decided to go take a shower and had some closed eye visuals as if I was a monk, when I got my head beneath the water and closed my eyes I could see some giant eye, with fire and multiple eyes in some halos around it, it was floating above a golden pedestal, really amazing tbh. Came to some realization as if that were me, it was crazy.


After that I went back to bed and ended seeing reality unfold over itself, it was as if every action, every moment in this reality created itself over and over

Cant really begin to explain it, after that the trip became lighter and I was completely astonished.

I am not sure how to integrate my trips, and I am not clear on what it means to integrate.

I've done quite a few trips over the years, and I've struggled to bring what i've experienced in the trips into my life. On my good trips it feels like I surrender to a loving/healing energy that is working on my body and emotions, and I've had some really profound shifts in my brain and the way I experience reality in an overwhelmingly positive way.

But these experiences only last as long as the trip lasts, and I don't know how to experience the open-mindedness, surrender, and healing energy while I'm sober. I've tried meditation and yoga over the years, but compared to the effects of psychidelics they feel very insufficient, and the only time I ever had significant results from meditation was on a 10 day retreat of doing nothing but meditating.

After a 2 year break from psychidelics i'm getting back into mushrooms, and I'm trying to figure out a good dose and trip frequency to transform my life.

We were laying in bed looking out the windows into the heavens the other night. We had just watch Fantastic Fungi and how to change your mind on Netflix. I've seen them both several times but it was her first time. Her mind was blown and the importance of fungus to our world and the connectiveness of it all. 

We've seen The Last of Us and I've played the game. So we are aware that some mushrooms can control minor life. Toxoplasmosis, a parasite has similar qualities on rats, a higher form of life.

With most people having weirdly similar experiences with psilocybin. Ones of connectiveness with views of the heavens while floating being the biases of most people's trip we believe that maybe this is the mycelian networks way of communicating with us? Maybe it's their way of changing our minds to be more intune with the mother gia?

By moving to a dominator role and away from the normal consumption with psilocybin we've lost touch with the gia.

And being that we're all part fungus in a way and ultimately find out way back into the earth and decomposing back into the earth. Decomposing that's lead by an armies of fungi. We further now believe that when we decompose our bodies are returning to ""heaven"". Heaven being back into the network of the mycelian.

1. It hits wayyyy harder than I thought it would
2. it hits wayyy later than I tought it would :D 

So let me get this straight: I know what I'm dealing with here, I'd taken the same acid a couple of times already. It's liquid, in a little spray bottle, mixed with distilled water. I don't know how familiar this community is with this form of consumption, but in my circle of friends, this is the go-to method and it works really well.

Anyways, I'm just kinda surprised cause I'm already like 2-3 hours in, and usually I'd be tripping balls after like 1,5 hours. This time the effects were really light in the first 2 hrs but now they hit me like really, REEEAAALLY strong. Like ""I'm having trouble typing and forming cohesive sentences"" strong :D

After last weekend I can‚Äôt help but disagree with that notion. Saturday I snorted ketamine and Sunday I snorted a good amount of 2CB along with some weed. 

The ketamine dealt the first blow, going in to Sunday it gave me a new perspective on what‚Äôs been bothering me, what finally ended it was the trip.

During the trip I overcame trauma that has plagued me since I was 17, trauma that has been resistant to every substance besides MDMA. 
The relatively clear headspace of 2CB made it easy to process the trauma logically as well as dissect my irrational fear, where on other psyches (especially shrooms) this is impossible for me. After pondering on it for a long time I realized that it‚Äôs time to let go. It hasn‚Äôt bothered me at all since, when I‚Äôm usually bothered by it on a daily basis.

2023-05-28 12:38:07,"The Cosmic Intersection of Space, Psychology, AI, and the Search for Meaning","Greetings, fellow psychonauts!

As we voyage through the vast cosmos of our consciousness, let's pause to reflect on the convergence of our inner and outer universes: psychology, space exploration, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), and our ceaseless quest for meaning.

Our minds, much like the universe, remain a grand frontier of exploration. Just as we gaze into the cosmos and seek to explore its depths, so too do we strive to understand the labyrinthine intricacies of the human mind. Psychology provides us with a map, an intricate charting of human behavior, cognition, and emotion.

Now, let's introduce the budding phenomena of artificial intelligence into this cosmic dance. AI, much like the human mind, learns, adapts, and makes decisions, albeit in a different context. By understanding human cognition, we're programming AI to think more like us. Conversely, AI's advancement is offering an unexpected mirror, reflecting our cognitive processes and biases.

In the grandeur of space, we find a parallel to our explorations in psychology and AI. As we probe further into the cosmos, seeking life and other civilizations, we're also questioning our place in the universe. We're asking the age-old questions: Why are we here? What is our purpose?

The progression of AI prompts similar existential queries. If we succeed in creating an intelligence equal to or beyond our own, where does that place us? What does it mean to be human in a world where our creations could match or even surpass us? 

This crossroad, where psychology, AI, and space exploration meet, challenges us to redefine life's meaning. It invites us to delve deeper into our consciousness while embracing the potential of our creations and the promise of space ‚Äì our final frontier.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. How do you perceive the connection between these areas? In what ways does it influence your understanding of life, existence, and consciousness? 

Safe travels through the cosmos of your minds, fellow explorers!",76,2025,12,324,1

As of today I have never been so comfortable in my own skin. I've never been so fearless. 

I have come to the conclusion, based on much research, and communicating with other's like me. 

I have intrusive REM intrusion, likely trigger4d by a near death experience at birth, or my narcolepsy.

It causes my waking, reality to be what I estimate to be a quarter to half tab of acid. I have never once in my life seen the same subjective reality as most. I experience life as a ""trip"" or hallucination from a normal perspective.

 It causes my dreams to be intense and vivid and psychadelic or mystical  and hyper-real dreams. They are the equivalent of a literal dmt trip. I'm not kidding. When I say I have one of *those* nightmares, I'm saying I am literally experiencing what scriptures describe as states of hell, lovecraftian shit.When I have a really good dream, it is like going to a heaven of sorts, or nirvana, or many other thing. 

 I have gone to great, outlandish lengths to fully understand the nature of my existence, often risking my own safety for answers. I have healed myself with borderline miraculous success. 

I do naturally experience psychedelic/mystical phenomena, and I always have. I generally do not have visual hallucinations while awake, and I have never heard voices. I do experience other things I refuse to share with some people, for my ownwell being as well as theres. I am not schizophrenic and I *finally* fucking know that for certain. This haunted and gifted me my entire life. I am *not* crazy and now I can prove it medically, and have the option to be treated if my own healing abilities were to ever fail. Also, I am not religious, nor have I joined any religion.told you im not crazyüò≠) Also, I am a comedian. Also, my ego dies in my sleep sometimes.üòÖ

This is me ""coming out"" as  someone born with a dynamically different experience of ""reality"", or whatever you'd like to call it. I never had a choice. I am done hiding, running, masking myself, and I am going to be more than okay.

I hope every one of you feels as safe, comfortable, and alive as possible. Be not afraid, and much love, to all of you.",149,2193,27,392,1

Psychedelics are no different in that aspect. They are SUPPLEMENTS to your life. You can choose whether or not you take away and apply what you have learned from your trips or you can choose not to. 

They will show you the path but you STILL have to put in the work every single day to make yourself and this world a better person/ place and full of love. You should ****strive everyday**** to be the best YOU that you can be; physically, mentally and emotionally!

2023-05-27 23:15:02,Manifestation & LSD,"Hi guys, for anyone here who believes in manifestation/LOA, I would love to discuss this recent experience I had with manifestation while on acid. 

I‚Äôve been well into manifestation for many years now. I‚Äôd like to say I have grasped the essence of manifesting/LOA, however i tend to struggle a bit in the execution of it. 

Recently I‚Äôd been trying to manifest a specific person back into my life, albeit with some intense blockages stemming from my ego. Some of these blockages include: the specific person lives far away, we haven‚Äôt spoken in YEARS, he has another love interest, etc. 

Last week I ended up tripping on an absurd amount of acid. It‚Äôs always hard to explain an acid trip, but essentially since I was experiencing intense visual hallucinations, I was able to look at my phone and PHYSICALLY see a text from this man, even though in reality it wasn‚Äôt there.

My eyes were wide open and it felt like I was literally bending/shaping physical reality with my mind. Of course, it was just because I was tripping balls. But it was so believable, and it felt SO real. 

I also experienced an intense ego death, which allowed me to reprogram any limiting belief or doubt I previously had in my mind that this person would never re-enter my life. 

The next morning, I ACTUALLY got a text from this specific person that was exactly the text I had hallucinated while I was tripping. It was one of the most mind-blowing things I‚Äôve ever experienced. 

Obviously when I‚Äôm sober, it‚Äôs not possible for me to trick my mind to seeing things that aren‚Äôt physically there.
The essence of manifestation is to believe you already have what you want, even if it‚Äôs not present in the 3D yet. 

Has anyone else experienced an instantaneous manifestation like this while on LSD?

Does anyone use LSD as some kind of spiritual bypass into tricking/re-wiring your subconscious mind to manifest things?

Honestly I wish I could reach such a heightened level of consciousness without any substances. But the visual hallucinations are almost impossible to replicate when I‚Äôm sober, and I think that was a huge selling point for the whole thing.

About a year ago, I had an unpleasant shroom trip that really freaked me out. It wasn‚Äôt my first experience and was probably my only experience with my history of weed and shrooms where I definitely felt vulnerable and scared. 

Nothing out of the ordinary happened during the trip, I just kinda laid in my friends bed and stared out the window just waiting for it to end (before you inform me on set and setting, I‚Äôm fully aware I was being very careless). Most of the time I got hit in waves by the anxiety that made me feel horrible, there were definitely moments of calm ( I remember walking into a 7/11 full of people and it made me feel a lot safer from the fear). Towards the end, I took a few shots of vodka to calm down a little and showered for about an hour listening to Radio New Vegas (lol) until the trip was over. I felt calm again and relieved. 

The next day I just woke up feeling nervous again, my thoughts were racing like they were the night before, I felt really anxious and began to wonder if this was the onset of some mental illness or something. I was definitely shaken up by the experience since I‚Äôd never felt so vulnerable to the fear of not being in control. Had to have friends over for the last three days of my lease because I didn‚Äôt want to be alone with my thoughts. I just felt so vulnerable and definitely didn‚Äôt feel like myself for the next few weeks, it‚Äôs almost like I was disconnected from my old, calmer self. I would experience panic attacks, high levels of anxiety, and sometimes I‚Äôd get persistent intrusive thoughts that just upset the hell out of me, I also started thinking of suicide due to these thoughts but deep down I knew I wouldn‚Äôt off myself. 

What‚Äôs made things worse is that for the past year, I‚Äôve basically been just reading drug induced psychosis stories , it‚Äôs almost like an addiction. Going online and trying to find that reassurance is impossible and that‚Äôs a problem I‚Äôm trying to fix. It‚Äôs impossible for me to figure out if it was psychosis or not, I know a big part of me feels like it wasn‚Äôt. two doctors told me I had an acute stress reaction with no signs of drug induced psychosis. I just want to be done with stressing out wether I had it or not and find some damn closure. Some posts give me that closure I need, and then other stories on here get me back to square 1.

2023-05-27 18:38:43,"Advice needed, Bad Trip Report and Death of my cat","Short: my cat will die tomorrow, 300 days before my bad trip where I thought that my cat died.

Hello guys 299 days ago I had a very bad trip, I am really experienced with lsd and only had 2 bad trips from maybe over 50 trips. So I will try to tell the things from the trip that I remember.

Me and my friend got to his place and wanted to Trip that night. He had 225mcg and I had 300mcg it was real 300 because it was 1V-LSD. I had zero tolerance and yeah, 0 tolerance with 300mcg I would say is crazy. We both took our dose and watched an nature documentary on the come up.

After a while we began to trip and we both wanted to watch different tv shows in other rooms alone. So before I started watching some shows I had the wonderful idea to smoke a small joint before watching. I did it and after that I really was starting to trip crazy. I started watching Rick and Morty and only managed to watch S3E7 and S3E6. While I watched the episodes I tripped harder and harder every minute, i was so gone and full ego death was coming.

After the episode I don‚Äôt remember much I absolutely passed out, full ego death, no orientation, absolutely crazy.  I was aware but couldnt move, I was shaking and could not talk and even think. My friend saw me for a minute but didn‚Äôt do anything which was the best thing he could do, I think if he would had tried to help me it would become worse.

The only thing that I remember while I was ‚Äûpassed out‚Äú that in some moments I though that I could stretch the time. I also could hear the entire dialogue of s4 stranger things which my friend was watching at that time. And now, and this is important I thought that my cat died. On the come down I managed it to turn on some music and I watched some birds in the sky through the window and cried because I thought my cat died. After the trip was almost gone I told my friend that my cat died, completely serious. He had a normal trip and thought I was talking absolutely bullshit which I was because after I came home my cat was alive.

The trip in itself was really helpful, for the next days I really felt miserable especially the day after the trip. BUT I felt so miserable that I started calisthenics just because I wanted to feel better about myself. I started an day countdown on my phone and started working out. It is the longest sport streak that I ever had and still have.

Today my father wanted to go to the animal hospital because the last days my cat is having trouble to breath. We went together this morning and my cat is really sick, it is either the heart or a tumor. We decided to put her to sleep tomorrow because it‚Äôs the best thing we can do to avoid more suffering for my cat.

After whe came home from the doctor,  I saw that the Calisthenics countdown is exactly at 299 days, 299 days ago I had that bad trip. So tomorrow is the day my cat will die exactly 300 days after I cried and told my friend that my cat died.

I really don‚Äôt know what to think about this, and would be really thankful to hear some of your opinions on this situation. I will now enjoy the last day with my cat, greetings from Germany and have a nice day ‚úåüèº",50,3141,10,617,1

While on a bunch of MDMA I started doing some nitrous balloons. After a couple of balloons, I realised I was replaying a loop and was adamant when I came too, that I wanted to share what happened in the loop with my friends. This then became the loop. I would go into the world and think I was waking up and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the answer..‚Äù then look around and realise I was still in a loop, and continue to wake up and replay same scenario until I came too and forgot what the answer was. With Each ballon the loops would deepen and deepen where there was 20+ cycles but each time I was becoming more and more adamant that I was bringing the answer to the real world, but infact I was just in the loop. Each time I thought I could cheat it and that this would be the time I brought the answer back to the world, but each time, it was just the loop. 

It was like I had the answer to the universe. Eventually I started to realise each time I came too, that there is no answer , the loop is just infinite. The answer is everything and nothing. This is the cosmic joke of the universe, you always forget 

I was shocked to read through that there are so many similar experiences which is why I wanted to share. Any thoughts?",49,1321,8,259,1

2023-05-27 07:25:30,They walk among us,"(I am being serious, so please at least do some research before you shut me down right away)

Okay, so I am now fully convinced that extra terrestrial life exists and they have contacted us many times in the past. I was on 400 ug of LSD a few months ago and I think a UFO came really close to me. It was an extremely bright light. And it left as fast as it came once I took my phone out to record it. I only caught a tiny speck in the sky as proof that I wasn't hallucinating. I am posting this here because psychedelics has helped me overcome this anxiety of probing further into this subject. Using psychedelics, I was able to open my mind to things I was just so closed off about in the past. That allowed me the courage to research/talk about this topic because I just get anxiety from knowing the mysteriousness of the universe.

I went down a deep rabbit hole and the evidence is all there. Crop circles that appear within hours so big that it would have taken at least a crowd of people to finish in time? Without footprints or paths/mud? The fact that the stems of the plants aren't bent, but ""manipulated"" by radiation? 

One crop circle in particular spooked me out the most. The one that was a direct response to our radio signal we sent a long time ago. The one where we sent a signal explaining our population/carbon base/DNA, ETC. We received an answer in crop circle form that said these aliens were ""silicon based, 21 billion population, spanned over 3 planets in their solar system, etc."" 

Also, let's not forget the constant UAP/UFO phenomenon that the Pentagon has even declassified themselves. They cannot explain it. They even confirmed it's not the Russians and not the Chinese. 

And these UAPs have gone back so long, that our technology just wouldn't have been able to accomplish any of what these objects are doing. In world war 2, pilots saw UFOs and the term ""foo fighters"" was coined to call them. They thought it was secret Nazi technology. Turned out the Nazis were seeing them too and thought it was us! 

The abduction stories. Some of them are just too too real. The one where the students in Africa all saw the UFO and encountered the aliens. The fact that they were all interviewed separately, 60 kids, and they all recounted the exact same details. What the aliens looked like, how the craft operated, etc. Another good abduction story is Betty and Barney. That one was just sooooo particularly creepy. 

Last but not least, all the ex-cia and government employees that have straight up just come out and confirmed this stuff. The fact that they are all consistent in how these things operate. Telepathically, anti-gravity generators to produce faster than light travel, etc. They are gray, big black eyes, skinny bodies and 3 fingers/toes. Approximately 4 ft tall. Every story going back for decades has been consistent. 

I don't know y'all maybe it's just the LSD/psychs talking... But I'm convinced for now. They walk among us!",18,2969,4,528,1

2023-05-27 05:39:04,Any tips for my first time in 30 years.,"I haven't done shrooms in 30 years. I guess I got older and got more hesitant to try things.  I have developed anxiety and  unfortunately I tend to overthink things or be overly prepared. I didn't used to be this way, but this mindset can make for a bad trip. 
I was hoping that doing shrooms would get me out of the anxiety and reset my pathway.  I just feel I need a reset after some serious trauma. 

 I was given two grams of  p cubes and also given micro dosing capsules and told to do one day on the microdose, two days off only for two weeks. I asked for lower dosage just to be safe. 

I know it's always been about set and setting. I will be alone doing these so I don't know if I should just stay home or go into the woods and chill out. I just don't want to freak out in the middle of the woods. I'm an outdoor person and love being outside so I feel it would be better to do it outside. But because of my anxiety, sometimes I feel more comfortable at home. I'm torn and obviously overthinking this. 

I remember being nauseated when I used to do mushrooms, then things would be amazing after that. Any tips? Should I do this on an empty stomach, do it in the morning and make sure I have an entire day to myself? 
Any tricks to help me stay positive and not overthink things?",39,1287,9,253,1

However, there is something far more profound to see than beautiful visuals and sensory distortions. That is, your life itself, with and without drugs, is an unbelievable psychedelic trip. The entire thing. Except, part of what you're doing during this trip, is pretending it's not a trip at all. Total amnesia. But you do this so that you can experience the excitement of transitioning from non-tripping, to tripping, and back again. This game might get old after a while. Another mundane day? So then, your amnesia begins to fade, and you realize that this whole time, you've been the transcendental dream. The beatific vision. You see your true face. And that is a whole new trip in itself! Then you go around telling people the secret out of pure delight. But have no fear! This won't spoil the secret cause the majority won't even believe you!

2023-05-27 02:57:09,Dialed it in - what's yours?,"So I've done a variety of doses and have recently started microdosing as well. I've done everything from three grams to seven grams of penis envy. Through a bunch of experimentations during the last year, I have found that 3 g of blue meanies seem to hit the spot just well for me. For me it manifests as me being slightly tired and yawning. I trip out very slightly but no real deep hallucinations. I stay present in a moment and I ""wake"" up feeling completely rejuvenated and it gives me the glow for at the very minimum the rest of the day. 

I end up looking at the world with feelings of pure happiness and just the outside world by itself is enough to bring me complete happiness. I also have to mention that I have started doing it early afternoon or late morning.  That way I have the rest of the day to enjoy the afterglow and I can't stress the euphoria of just being outside enough. It's also enough that I'm not impaired and I can go and do normal daytime stuff without feeling like I was just fucked up. 

I used to do it at night but I find daytime tripping to be more beneficial and a lot less prone to turn ""bad"". I used to experiment with a bunch of different strands, but I find that this one puts out a consistently good trip for me. 

Anyone else have it locked in in terms of grams and strand?

2023-05-27 02:56:34,Any opiate addicts that are steadily H/fent/pills (or steadily taking subs) use ketamine at all?,"If so, any details? warnings? Recommendations? I'm in the process of getting off what is supposed to be H but is obvi at least partially fent and back on subs for the first time in about 10 years using the Bernese method. I was so scared because the last however-many times I tried to get back on subs I got the WORST precip. WD's so I feel like I have like a type of PTSD from those attempts, but surprisingly it's been going well so-far. I'm doing a slow taper up on the subs. I started  at .125 twice a day and today I'm up to1mg twice a day with little discomfort. I'd be pissed if I didn't use some time off I'd saved up at work, but if I had to I could... so far. Theres obviously still discomfort. 

Once I get clean I plan to get back into therapy and have looked into a million different paths that I can take. I'm interested to trying micro-dosing psilocybin and ketamine. But also interested in maybe trying to dissociate or trip just a little bit. I'm in the most positive place mentally than I've ever been before about having to stop and I'm just DONE with it all. Think that it could do me some good to try at lower doses and writing, etc. I know things should really be guided by a professional or  a shaman, but I'm just wondering if anyone's ever done it it or not?

I'm sure I'll just get a ton of people telling me how stupid of a question this is, but it's worth a shot. Not looking to abuse anything, just try therapeutically... prob just microdose.

2023-05-26 22:16:48,Anyone else think that drawing a distinction between humanity and nature is a mistake?,"Our species is certainly unique in our accomplishments and position in the animal kingdom but our existence is essentially another iteration of nature. You could argue written language, technology and our development of complex systems exist apart from nature because those things are understood as unprecedented on this planet. These things could be described as wholly human and could be used as evidence of humanity's separation from nature, but complex systems and new technologies are typical in nature. Sure, we've advanced much more rapidly than any other species we've observed but attibuting that to some phenomenal aspect of ourselves doesn't take into account the natural environment that pre-empted it and also ignores the ongoing effect natural processes have on us. 

I'm inclined to think religion led to the widespread embracing of this distinction, given that most religions assume that humans contain a divine spark that allows us to connect and relate to the divine which is also usually assumed to have an intellect and existence similar to our own. It is also possible ownership of land, domesticated plants and animals could be responsible given it necessitates a distinction between the owner and the property. However, any of these systems would also be a product of nature as I'm claiming everything would be, so perhaps it is irrelevant what exactly caused the distinction to occur and more relevant that such a distinction could naturally occur in the first place. 

I guess to sum up: on the subject of nature and humankind I'm making an arguement for dialectic materialism. It's an interesting perspective given it implies that nature is the source of sentience and higher level intellect instead of an unnatural phenomena unique to our species. In my mind, it changes what it means to be human.",86,1824,14,295,1

I‚Äôm pretty sure Schr√∂dinger said something along the lines of there‚Äôs only one mind in the cosmos. It feels like that sometimes, the experience of consciousness being a singularity. It‚Äôs trippy.

This is why ego is a very necessary condition of the self. As it allows itself to navigate through reality via the usage of identities, components of itself.

I have been off anti-depressants for two months now. I have had depression throughout my life. I‚Äôm not sure what happened to me today but I will try to explain‚Ä¶.I laid on my bed with eyeshades listening to music. The music sounded way more intense. I felt like it was coming into my two ears differently and I could hear all the different nuances of the music that I would not normally hear. At all times I felt like I could remove eyeshades and get back to my normal routine (kinda). I did feel like I was a little drunk. While I was meditating I did have some memories from childhood that came back into my mind that made me feel very sad. I had not thought about those memories in years and had all but forgotten them. 
At all times during, I wondered if it was just me trying hard to make something happened. At one point, I felt extremely cold so I took at hot bath. I stared at my hands and my body and got a little concerned because I felt if I stared long enough that my body parts could morph into something different. It was like I could see something else in my hands and stomach. This made me uncomfortable so I went back to the bed with eyeshades and listened to music. During this time, I thought about my maternal grandmother who passed before my birth. She had a very difficult life‚Ä¶..lost children, was extremely poor and suffered from severe depression. It was like I felt a closest to her and felt like we both carried the weight of the world. This too made me very sad and I cried, but again I felt like I was running the show.

A feeling like there was no room at the table for me in a figurative sense. All the time, I wondered if I was just making this up and trying so hard to get something from my experience.

2023-05-26 17:14:02,Understanding Growth in Psychedelic Experience (and Life in General),"I just published a new essay that aims to present a relatively simple, inclusive, and pragmatic paradigm for understanding how growth and change can occur through the use of psychedelics. This is important for two main reasons:

1. Psychedelics are on their way to being integrated into the western medical model. But they are almost exclusively talked about as being used for healing, which is often simply regarded as a reduction of negative symptoms. This provides an extremely limited model that doesn‚Äôt account for much of the actual experience and transformative potential. The more limited the model of understanding the experience, the more limited we are in our ability to support a variety of experiences and challenges.
2. There are many dimensions to the integration of psychedelic experiences, and one very important aspect is helping people understand their experience and the changes that occur as a result. Many people are left confused and disoriented after transformative psychedelic experiences. Having a framework to understand can be reassuring and offer guidance to further support the individuals process.

2023-05-26 16:14:07,Mushroom vd LSD costing (crazy),"Hi all. I figured something out, and it BLEW MY MIND.  


I-   paid ¬£50 for 7g of Cubensis

I paid ¬£30 for 20 x 220ug LSD (Strength - 220ug / Type Crystal - white fluffy 99.7% pure )

I am told 4g of Mushrooms is equivalent to around 300ug, meaning I could get 14 trips (like I had yesterday) for ¬£30, unlike mushrooms which would cost ¬£400 for the same amount of hits. 

That is absolutely crazy. My next task is to try and find out from more experienced people how much UG of LSD is the same as 4g of mushrooms and make both trips back to back (2 weeks apart). I can't see mushrooms being that much better than they are worth the 13 x price difference.",31,654,5,129,1
2023-05-26 15:52:42,LSD ug equivalent of 4g of Mushrooms + 4g trip report!,"Yesterday, with some melodic Psy Trance playing (wow, this shit was MADE for tripping), I took 4g of Cubensis and a few bumps of ket beforehand. I did a bit of coke ahead too. Low quality, .4.   


TBH. It started as a solo sexual endeavour (with the k and c) watching porn and you know what. Then I remembered I had some mushrooms and wanted to see what would happen if I took them for a sexual experience.   


At first, it was MINDBLOWING. What an incredible experience. Out of the fucking world. Then it just got too much; I went limp dick, and that sexual shit was not happening due to how FUCKED I was.  I accepted it and just started to enjoy the ride. It is insane how mesmerized you are when tripping with music in the background. 

I wish I did not do the Coke & Ket now, and I am trying to figure out (something I will only do once I try 4g on their own, lol) how much of an effect the K, in particular, had on my trip intensity. I had .4 of k before the mushrooms and STUPIDLY .1 ish x 2 as I came up from the shrooms. 

Everything was INSANE; it was the best experience of my life, the feeling, the music, and the fact most humans will never experience this. WOW!

However, I had a terrifying second half of the journey, which I believe was ket-related (one-second music was happy and bright, the next, it would all slow down, and the trip would get EXTREMELY dark and tight, adding pressure to my entire body. The trip got happier if I thought of happy things (my cats, girlfriend, etc.), which helped and the music sped up and everything went happy again. This, I am SURE, was ket related. It felt very K-like.   


It was terrifying for a while. Also, I started to panic thinking I had done the coke and felt my heart was beating crazy fast, and you know how it goes from there. I rang my GF (god knows how), and that settled me down. I had a severe anxiety attack at one point, which I just about managed to control before its peak. At one point, I did think I was dying. Fuck doing coke every again when tripping. 

&#x200B;

This trip taught me a few lessons (these only apply to my thought process)

1 - Do not mix drugs until you know how each drug works on its work. Especially coke! 

2 - Do not make a trip on a Thursday afternoon when everyone is outside and working, and you feel like a druggie, tripping absolute fucking balls. Do it at night or on a weekend when people are generally not working, and you don't feel like an unproductive member of society)

3 - Finish off any work  (emails, admin etc.) and be sure you have nothing that can worry you 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I have some LSD (220UG hits), which are about 99999 x cheaper than Mushrooms, and I wanted to know how much ug of LSD is equivalent to 4g of cubensis? 

I am told it's around 300ug, meaning I could get 14 trips (like I had yesterday) for ¬£30. Unlike mushrooms which would cost ¬£400 for the same amount of hits

 (I paid ¬£50 for 7g of Cubensis, and I paid ¬£30 for 20 x 220ug LSD (Strength - 220ug  
 Type Crystal - white fluffy 99.7% pure )

2023-05-26 13:01:55,Dmt trip stuck,"Hello fellow psychonauts 
On my last 2 dmt trips I felt that I am stuck at the same point. Where I am loosing the grasp of who I am and actually have to say my own name out loud to come back to myself and to realise I am in charge of my body. Felt like I had to fight (aka focus intensely) to be able to go back. 
The moment I am stuck is where the Devine being is basically telling me that they control everything. Tried to challenge it twice (one time each trip) and the being told me it‚Äôs going to move a part of my friends body and a second later mentioned part of my friends body moved, something similar happened when I challenged that on the 2nd trip. 
Did anyone had any similar experiences? Also I really want to go deeper and I am wondering weather it would be good to just surrender myself and let go of me as Me, is that the right path to go? 
I‚Äôll add that on the first trip it happened there was a lot of beautiful and enlightening things happening before that and then I just merged with friends as one and couldn‚Äôt find a way to separate myself from them and on the second time there was actually close to none usual dmt visuals, more like I just got straight to the being.

2023-05-26 09:23:31,Fell in love with a rock,"A week ago, while tripping on magic mushrooms, my friends and I embarked on an unforgettable journey along the train tracks. As I stumbled through the rocky path, a particular rock caught my eye. It was a vibrant red lava rock that seemed to radiate with an otherworldly energy.

Feeling an inexplicable connection, I snatched up the rock and named it Rocky. From that moment, things took a peculiar turn. I became utterly obsessed with protecting and caring for Rocky. No one was allowed to touch it except my closest friends, who probably thought I'd lost my mind.

But here's where it gets really weird. As the trip continued, Rocky's warmth intensified. I could swear it had a heartbeat. Yes, a freaking rock had a heartbeat. I couldn't believe my psychedelic-addled mind.

Drugs usually take you to trips that have meaning, something in your unconscious so in my altered state, I started pondering the deeper meaning of it all. Why did I choose this particular rock? Why did I feel so connected to it? What does it mean i relate myself to a rock? 

Im still trying to figure out this questions, i hope someone can help me figure out what are the answers.",24,1159,6,204,1

2023-05-26 08:58:21,I think I need to go back (looking for advice),"About 2 years ago I had a pretty crazy experience on DMT (check my post history for more info, but frankly the details aren‚Äôt super important). For the first 6 months to a year or so after doing it, I didn‚Äôt feel any notable ‚Äúnegative‚Äù effects. However, over the last 6 months, I feel like I‚Äôve lost a lot of motivation to succeed in this life. 

I work in finance on Wall Street. I used to love the idea ‚Äúbeating‚Äù people. I always wanted to be the hardest worker and I felt a deep desire to prove to everyone around me that I‚Äôm smarter than them (even when I wasn‚Äôt). I had a deep desire to be extremely successful and be famous in the world of finance. I‚Äôm sure this all sounds really stupid but please hear me out please.  

Lately I‚Äôve found I have a lot less motivation in my career. I‚Äôve stopped caring about being super rich and successful. I‚Äôm not saying this is a bad thing (it‚Äôs objectively good to not care about this stuff in my opinion). But what I struggle with is the feeling of a missing piece in my life. I link this to my DMT experience. If you went back and read my post about my DMT experience, you‚Äôll know I don‚Äôt remember a lot from it. 

I don‚Äôt know what questions I have but I know that I want answers. I‚Äôm a generally happy person but I feel like there‚Äôs a part of me that‚Äôs missing. I see the world differently and I just have this innate feeling that I‚Äôm sitting right on the brink of having a completely different understanding of life. At the same time though, I feel so far away from it. 

So my question to you all is has anyone ever felt this way? 

The thought of doing DMT again scares the hell out of me but I know there‚Äôs more out there that I need to see. That I need to learn.

After us vibing out for a few hours listening to some gnarly bass and just having (what I thought was) a blossoming connection to the point where we were teasing exploring what I would say is 2nd in intimate ways. They texted me shortly after saying we should just be friends. I said that‚Äôs totally cool, music to my ears. They asked why lol - I said it‚Äôs nice to focus on the music and have that be our united interest and intent.  Shortly after told me they felt anxious around me. & that we couldn‚Äôt talk because of my drug use. I feel judged because I was so open and even shared how theres a lot of stigma around safe proper drug use and how it can be used as a tool for the finest things in life - especially self discovery. It‚Äôs so bittersweet because I really enjoyed this person and found them stimulating in ways that I thought they could become a special person to me. & so I feel confused. They literally deleted their entire instagram, rejoined the next day and then deleted it again. I know I‚Äôm not blocked because I checked their account from google safari not logged in. It‚Äôs such confusing puzzling behaviour. & they‚Äôre truly an enigma because they have such a refined intuitive taste in producing/finding music for someone who is so against drugs.

The best way is **actions**. Shock your family and friends by suddenly quitting smoking, losing 100 pounds, changing career, lots of sudden bold changes. THEN, when they're curious and ask what happened, your psychedelic tripping will suddenly carry far more power and weight in terms of convincing them, or getting an interested audience.",107,639,18,106,1

2023-05-26 01:47:56,"Everyone talks about Ego Death, but what about Ego Rebirth?","It just came to my mind after seen a meme on facebook and it got me thinking about how my psychodelic experiences have been more of an ""ego boost"" than ""ego death"". When I started regularly taking acid (and by regular I mean once every couple of months) my experiences have been, atleast to myself more of a buildup than destruction of what I believe to be myself. 

Last week my best friend passed away and I took some shrooms on Friday, I had already been planning it, and decided that I wanted help processing his passing instead of exploring something else I was thinking of exploring. They showed me and taught me what I think I needed to continue the process of ""building myself"" by helping me in the process of making peace with the fact that someone I spend 23 years of my life is now gone. Not that I'm over it, I never will be but there was something, a spark, that I still cannot pinpoint that felt that everything is going to be alright, to continue in the path I'm on (not regarding drugs of course but how I'm doing in general), it was a very emotional trip

Every trip I've had has been kind of like that, IDK if I did experienced ego death, but honestly I don't care. Every time I trip it's like it helps me put another piece of the puzzle that is myself together. I still don't know what positive change it's gonna come into my life, but I know it will come, after a cooldown period I always make a decision to change for the better. 

IDK, my life has changed for the better in the past year and what happened last week was a pretty serious hit to my psyche but I know it's gonna be alright. My dude wants me to be alright wherever he may be and I know that I want to learn to meet every day with a smile like he did and to always see beauty and goodness in everyone and everything. 

Maybe that's what I have to learn right now, but it doesn't really feel like a deconstruction of myself, no trip of mine has felt like that. They have felt like the formless takes form and it strives to become what it should be. Like retaking and reclaiming parts of me that were lost and broken.

2023-05-25 20:24:16,Hallucination(?) where all sound suddenly disappears causing sudden consciousness?,"Hey all, so I experience hypnagogic hallucinations every night, but Ive been noticing a specific hallucination regularly appearing and today I even experienced it in a lucid dream which lead me to wonder if theres more to it. Like the title says what usually happpens is that while I doze off to sleep suddenly all sound disappears and I fully regain consciousness, even though there was no sound to begin with if that makes sense. I theorized earlier that maybe there was in fact sound in my head and that sound disappears suddenly causing me to immediately becoming more alert.

Today however I had a lucid dream in which I found out I was dreaming because a sticker on whatsapp responded to a question I had. After this happened immediately all sound again disappeared and again I am fully conscious, even more than I usually am in lucid dreams. This has lead me to wonder that maybe the sudden silence doesnt cause the immediate consciousness in my hallucinations, but that I suddenly become conscious while im trying to sleep which creates the silence.

Anyway wanted to express my thoughts on this somewhere since I have nowhere else to do that. I am curious though if anyone else also experiences this?",82,1209,9,210,1

 So it‚Äôs been a year and i‚Äôve barely even smoked weed! Made an incredible body transformation, eat only whole foods, and am generally just so much more developed as a human. I‚Äôve changed a lot though, greatly due to these trips, and while that last ‚Äúadventure‚Äù with the mush basically eradicated all fear of bad trips (as I went beyond what could even be labeled good/bad lol), i don‚Äôt know what to expect.

 Setting would be a remote cabin in the woods with my friend who‚Äôs done 500ug. There would be cannabis involved, as it has been part of my tripping since the first time.

2023-05-25 19:26:04,Any survivors of bunk psychedelic overdoses out there? How are you doing in hindsight?,"Curious to if any of you have had any lasting neorological effects or how everyone is doing now.

7 years ago I was given one cap filled with powder of ""really good MDMA"" from my partner at the times dad. I was young, dumb,trusting and didn't test my drugs back then. It was very clearly not mdma from the get go. I'm pretty sure it was NBome.. my ex said they were high for close to 24 hours, I started having convulsions 5 hours into the trip (also always thought it was weird how prolonged it was) at some point became unconscious and was taken to the hospital where I died, and came back.  I had a weird NDE and woke up days later in the ICU. I'm honestly really lucky  to still be here.  

7 years later I'm in the process of having a neological disorder diagnosed (looking likey to be multiple sclerosis) and I can't help but wonder if it was in part caused by that.  
I'm having a hard time finding too much info on how an nbome overdose actually kills you. I also can't be positive it was nbome, just my assumption from the effects experienced and my reaction from such a small dose. I'm pretty versed in psychedelics, and have never experienced anything like the substance I was on that night before or sense.  

I also get REM intrusion, but I think that's common amongst people with a NDE.  Although weirdly the frequency of that diminished after an intense dmt experience last October. It also dramatically helped some of the neorlogical symptoms I am having, like I've have dysautonomia and after that experience my digestive issues seemed to get dramatically better. 


I look forward to the day psychedelics are available to everyone without the potential of passing through hands of people that don't care about the well  being of the consumer.  

always test your drugs even when you trust the source ‚ù§Ô∏è",86,1820,14,327,1
2023-05-25 17:04:20,"For those of you that had a psychotic episode or drug induced psychosis, what was it like?","When you look back at that time in your life do you feel like ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt you‚Äù? Or rather, ‚Äúyou weren‚Äôt yourself‚Äù?

I am asking because I am curious about consciousness, and what consciousness is like for an individual experiencing psychosis?

&nbsp; 

I definitely have some very delusional thinking when I am tripping balls, and believe in some crazy conspiracy stuff, but it all goes away once sober. I feel like I have expanded, liberated consciousness when high, and a fairly constrained, law abiding consciousness while sober.

2023-05-25 16:24:03,Post Trip Report - Albino Riptide,"Summary: I went to a 3 day music festival and consumed PE Revert, and ART (Albino Riptide). I‚Äôm here to tell you about my post trip hallucinations that I am still having 4 days after my last trip, which was 9.25g of ART. 

Consumption schedule: 
Day 0 - 3.25g (PE Revert)
Day 1 - 4.25g ART 
Day 2 - 6.50g ART
Day 3 - 9.25g ART 

I will not be discussing my trip on days 0 - 3, that will be discussed on a separate post someday. Purpose of this post is to tell you about the post hallucinations I‚Äôm still going through. All of these encounters mentioned below occurred when I am sleeping during the night.

Monday (T+1) - I had vivid dreams that I‚Äôm still at the festival. I would close my eyes and still see and feel that I am still dancing my heart out. Even had very clear visions of the people whom I was with. I was half awake saw about 8-10 entities dancing in my living room. They were having lots of fun and wanted to be left alone. To my right is a computer chair, which had clothes hanging on top of. There were two entities here, observing me. Their face was pitch black, almost like a shadow figure, but their eyes lit up like the stars. Anyways, they are human-like in different shapes and sizes. 

I believe I was still half asleep at this point, when I finally opened my eyes and fully awake, they slowly disappeared, eyes no longer illuminating like the stars. Mind you, I just got back from the trip and haven‚Äôt had the chance to fully unpack, but these entities used the items around my living room to morph themselves into becoming one. Their personality reminded me of characters from Toy Story, coming alive when nobody is around, and plays dead the moment they see someone else observing.

Tuesday ( T+2): saw a tall dark figure next to my bedside and another on the foot of my bed looking at me. The one on my bedside was jacked Af lol, he was turned around but I could see his body and the back of his head. The one on the foot of my bed was a tall dark figure with illuminating eyes. 

Wednesday (T+3): the entities from Monday returned to my bedside, I sensed a male and female entity. They were hugging each other, when I finally opened my eyes fully they disappeared. Again, I could see their body, and arms but their face was pitch black with illuminating eyes. In addition, I think I was astral walking through different times and places. I saw visions of another festival which I‚Äôm not familiar with yet. Even had full on conversations with a human being. 

Conclusion: 
I don‚Äôt feel like they want to harm me, but rather just observing and looking while I‚Äôm asleep. I am not terrified (yet). These entities are good and want to be left alone. Please respect them if you ever have the same encounter as I did. If you have any suggestions or thoughts please share them with me. Am I at a point where I need to consult with a spiritual shaman or should I take a chill pill and ride it out. I hope I‚Äôm not going crazy. You guys are amazing, much love.

Since I'm facing depressive episodes (not that bad at this time of the year) and severe Tinnitus I feel like some advice is needed. I read about using LSD as a cure for Tinnitus.

2023-05-25 06:38:07,"Need advice - feeling like I need to ""go back"" after intense psychedelic experience","I recently had a very intense acid trip with some friends that allowed me to do a lot of healing with many of the mental health issues that I have recently been struggling with. It was the kind of trip where you connect with the divine and experience the pure, unadulterated love of the universe in its clearest form and I believe it was an important step in my mental health recovery. However, there is a problem.

Every time I have an intense trip like the one I had a few days ago, I always come away from it feeling like I need to wait a long time before I have another experience, like I've ""gotten the message"" for the time being, if that makes sense. But this time has been markedly different - I have an intense feeling that something came up and went unresolved during the trip, likely because I was with friends and didn't want to ruin their trip, and that I need to trip again as soon as I get the opportunity because I need to purge this important piece of negativity out of my psyche. However, it feels as though it is buried very ""deep"" and will be extremely intense and painful when I have to face it during my next trip, but I also know it will be extremely liberating and might finally resolve this depressive slump I've been in for so long.  


I need advice from the more experienced psychonauts here - I've only taken acid three times, shrooms twice. Should I listen and face the difficulty of the experience? I just remember my previous difficult trips have been so unbelievably hard to get through that I really am afraid to put myself through that again.

MDMA‚Äôs ability to facilitate open communication through inducing a state of openness, safety, trust, social connection, and increased empathy suggests it may be useful for couples therapy, especially given that many couples are not successful in therapy or do not see their gains made last over time.

We want to gain a deeper understanding of the perceived effects of MDMA on a romantic relationship from the perspective of the couple. If you have taken MDMA with a current or ex-partner in the last five years in a private, we would like to hear about how you felt the experience affected your relationship.

Stephanie Freitas is conducting this research towards a Master of Professional Psychology degree at the Australian College of Applied Professions (ACAP), supervised by Dr. Fiona Ann Papps, an associate professor in Psychological Science.

Inclusion criteria are that participants:

&#x200B;

* be aged 18 years or older.
* have taken MDMA with their current or ex-partner in the last five years in a private setting.
* of any sexual orientation.
* Read and understand English well enough by their own assessment to complete a e-interview in English.
* have no prior relationship with researcher or her supervisor.

If you choose to participate, you will complete an anonymous 45-minute e-interview about your experience of the effects of a joint MDMA experience on your romantic relationship.

The e-interview would be conducted online, and we collect no identifying information.

For a while, I‚Äôve had a ‚Äúdoubt‚Äù of the so called ‚Äúvisuals‚Äù some might see on psychedelics. Not as to whether or not we see it (I do, a lot) but whether or not this is really our mind creating those or, rather, our mind being able to ‚Äúsee what‚Äôs there‚Äù!

From what I understand, psychedelics tend to disable (or disarm) the ‚Äúdefault mode network‚Äù in our brain. What if our brain was ‚Äúdisabling‚Äù those hallucinations not because they are not ‚Äúthere‚Äù, but rather because they would be overwhelming. I don‚Äôt know if that makes any sense!

What if psychedelics were enabling us to see what is really there? See the vibrations, see the waves, ear all of that we don‚Äôt hear but that is there?

2023-05-24 19:04:37,Autism/adhd/neurodivergency and psychedelics,"I've struggled with sensory issues from my autism and adhd for many years. I spent a good amount of time enjoying weed for the effects it has on my sensory issues (generally makes it extremely easy for me to handle sensory problems) before moving to salvia after finding it was legal in my state. I to this day haven't had a bad salvia trip and really enjoy the way it feels/how it has helped with my healing process. Recently I've tried psilocybin and soon hopefully lsd. My experience with the shrooms was intensely overstimulating. Pure psychological torture for several hours. Pain from every inch of my body and the longer it lasted the worse it felt. I've taken several smaller doses and a heroic dose and surprisingly the heroic dose was by far my most enjoyable and peaceful trip. These smaller trips made the time passing feel insufferable. Made all light and sound turn up to the maximum. All I could do was bury my head in the couch and sob. The after effects I've been experiencing have been amazing however. I've never felt so clear, I have dissociated considerably less, less depression and I feel my neurodivergency issues have been considerably less problematic for me. 

Now here's the real question for me. I want to continue using these things to further my spiritual journey. However I don't want to experience another 6 hrs of pain type trip. After researching and finding that lsd can last up to 12 hrs I've decided until I find an answer it's best to not try it yet. Does anyone have ideas on how to improve the extreme sensory overload/overstimulation? I take pride in my set/setting already and it's how I've managed to stay within my comforts with salvia. Distracting myself wasn't an option during these shroom trips and I couldn't find any comfort. For my heroic dose trip I found I was able to slightly calm myself down during a small paranoid phase using my thc pen. However I find it extremely hard to use it when I'm tripping. It feels like they physically won't allow me to hit it.

2023-05-23 23:29:34,Weird shroom trip,Long story short I was tripping in my dorm room for a couple hours on like 2Gs and i had been smoking before it started to kick in. While I was peaking I decided it would be a good idea (obviously wasn‚Äôt) to load up my bowl with some bud and some of the shroom debris left on my table and took about one or two big hits. Also I had barely eaten anything that day so my blood sugar was probably low. But anyway after that I kinda fell into another dimension and everything was black but there were a bunch of colors and shit. I was also scrolling thru Spotify to find some music to play. Then next thing I know I black out and am woken up about 4 seconds later to hearing my name being called by my friend and my legs shaking uncontrollably ( I was sitting in a chair looking out the window with my legs propped up on the wall). It took me a second to get fully awake but I felt fine when I woke up just a little scared. I ended up dropping my bowl during all of this and just was scared to be around other people during the rest of the trip but once I got alone I cleaned my room and started watching surfing videos and then I was fine. I‚Äôm not scared of them and plan to do them again in a different environment. Prolly made some stupid decisions during the trip but just wondering if anyone knows what happened.,17,1313,3,263,1
2023-05-24 17:01:27,Ego Death Every.Single.Time doing LSD mixed with weed,"Well as the title said I‚Äôve done LSD for around 10 times, from around half a tab (50ug) to 250ug max. Whenever i smoke some weed I immediately experience ego death, it‚Äôs not a bad trip but to describe it‚Äôs a feeling that I don‚Äôt know who I am and disconnected with every other people including families and friends. In that state of mind I feel connected to every single being yet forgetting all about my memories and other people and life just seems like where I am matters. Has anyone experienced the same and to me it‚Äôs slowly realizing this is the absolute truth (we‚Äôre all gonna die someday and lose someone someday).
My question is I feels like I have done enough LSD and if I increase the dose does it gets any stronger in terms of effects and realization?
‚Äî-
I has been meditating for 6 years before doing psychedelics and these lessons has been learnt through it but doing psychedelic literally makes everything so so real, my another question is if it‚Äôs real then everybody would experience the same, do you feel the same?",53,1032,8,188,1
2023-05-24 16:51:51,DMT trip intensified by black seed oil,"I have been loving experimenting with low dose DMT since I got a cart a couple weeks ago. I feel a peaceful, meditative buzz for a few minutes and then a lovely afterglow for a while after. One day after taking black seed oil I took a small hit and got much more intense visuals and emotions than I was expecting. The character of the open eye visuals was strangely different from other low/medium dose trips I've had. Everything got strangely translucent and I could see electricity-like patterns inside my arms and the plants around me. Also when I looked at my arms or feet, they appeared distinctly big and swollen and pudgy, which was an odd effect that I hadn't experienced in past trips. The trip was also a couple times as long as a normal DMT trip. Does anyone else have experience with black seed oil + psychedelics?",38,826,7,150,1
2023-05-24 16:37:00,Did I encounter a negative entity? Was it just a manifestation of my negative energy?,"I took shrooms yesterday and had the most profound experience of my entire life. I had a full ego death for the first time in my life and visited a spiritual plane I've never reached before. I felt so scared and confused cause I didn't know where I was and thought I was alone, and the universe was communicating with me through different people and guiding me through it, one being my best friend from college who's an older mentor figure I felt like I ""needed"" to contact. He wasn't giving me the energy I needed so I texted my much older neighbor who's extremely spiritual and he fully connected to my energy and was a vessel for the universe to speak to me through. I learned about how the world works, as we are all just energy feeding draining and bouncing off each other and how all religions and spiritual beliefs are connected, as they connect us to the higher powers and could be accessed through prayer. I felt more in control as I was gaining a better understanding of what was happening, but when I wasn't focused on my energy I started to lose control.

I went inside when I got too overwhelmed and started freaking out. I was pulling at my hair and felt like I was going crazy past the point of no return. I was walking in circles in the bathroom talking out loud to myself that I was going crazy and gonna be locked up in an asylum for the rest of my life. I felt truly insane, I couldn't tell what was real and when I would talk to people it felt like the horror movie smile where the main girl is crazy and is trying so hard to find people who understand and everyone else making her feel like she was nuts. This damn movie haunted me the whole trip. I was terrified that this would last forever, and I would never be able to come back down, but at the same time I didn't want to come down because I would lose the knowledge that I learned. I was asking the universe for guidance and spoke to what I believed to be a spirit guide, who took the form of an owl and embraced me and I felt the most comfort and love I ever have in my life. When I tuned into that energy, I felt safe and loved, but when I let my mind wander away from that energy and to a more negative space I was out of that moment and felt unsafe.

I was spiraling and felt like I was fully losing control. I let these thoughts take over and then felt like I needed to get the negative energy out of my body immediately. I was purging over the toilet and felt like a demon was crawling out of my mouth. At this point I fully felt like there was something very bad that entered, I don't know how to describe it but it was an internal feeling telling me that there was someone unknown and dangerous in the spiritual plane i was taken to. I was convinced if I kept throwing up it would cure my depression cause I thought that my depression was me being possessed by a demon this whole time as I've felt extremely off and dark at all times in the past few years, as if there is something terrifying inside my brain following me everywhere. And I believed I brought this negative energy to the surface and was confronting it face to face. As my ego came back, I realize that this is a very bold claim to make but I'm having trouble unpacking and understanding what this was. How I understand it is that the negative anxiety I was feeling manifested into what my mind has known about ""demons"" and ""hell"" from church and movies to personify the intense emotions I was feeling.

Words have never been my best medium, I apologize if this doesn't really make sense. If anyone could help me unpack any part of this trip I would greatly appreciate it, as I'm entirely new to the spiritual world and have never met one of my spirit guides, or even really believed in any of this, before yesterday. I also am not sure where to go from here, how to continue to expel this negative energy.",85,3856,15,740,1

2023-05-24 13:49:24,"Integration Time Is Being Taken, Advice For Next Trip","Preface-I just did LSD recently and I had worked alongside it to help kill some of my anxiety, that was my main focus. However, I also realized that due to LSD's partial synthesis it does not provide the same full effects as mushrooms or ayahuasca or even salvia. I have a handful of experiences with natural psychs, the most eye opening ones are the latter 3, (not to include fly agaric, kava kava and kanna if you will, damina leaf and blue lotus petals) .  While LSD was my first psych and I can recall 30+ separate trips and how much it helped but it showed me and told me again that it has very little left to offer in terms of healing especially after 1mg. I have done 12gs of shrooms but my strongest trip was 8gs of APEs where I relived every single bad thing I had ever done as the things I did them too. I watch my life fall apart, build back up and then I came back. The mushrooms were acting as me showing me, teaching me a lesson. They also unblocked A lot of blacked out memories that I had forgotten that I tried to reach with acid. The ayahuasca my first journey showed me a black spider coming down from the ceiling and me sitting up, it landing on my shoulder and I could do nothing. I ""heard"" a voice say that isolation is not a positive set of mind, I had not left my apartment for 5 days nor had I seen the sun and aya showed me to start hiking, I lived in Colorado, it showed me how to be happy wherever I am. After coming home, I talked to Aya  again and was shown beauty in death and how life can not go on without an end, this was about 8months after my grandfather passed and she told me it's okay.  I've always been weary of mixing psychs but I did finally try acid, shrooms, and dmt. I was about 4 hours in on the lsd, watching fear and loathing for the 3rd time in a row and decided to take mushrooms, once those kicked in, in about 45mins I was given a peaceful warmth over myself and saw the beauty in todays life even with all the bad. Those times weren't better, more people were being murdered and more wars were being fought, diseases ran rampant. It's not the time that was better, it's he nostalgia from it and the misunderstanding of us in todays time. When I smoked the DMT while the movie was on with all 3 relatively in a effect, to say I stopped is an understatement. Dissorealatilusazion is the best non word to describe what was experienced, but it showed the way of connection between everything and all will be okay we just can never predict when. Time never stops, but us as people can,  
""And instead of saying all of your good byes   
Let them know you realize that life goes fast  
It's hard to make the good things last  
You realize the sun doesn't go down   
It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round""  
\- The Flaming Lips  
Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots ""Do You Realize??""  
The salvia has shown me we must always be at peace with what is, there are moments where we can not control and salvia has the ability to show us how we feel when we lose control, it's not something to be feard but rather focused. Lady salvia does not want to hurt you, she's just a wild friend who's there to show you it's okay.  
For the next trip I will be continuing  further into my trauma and past and continue to uncover what was lost so I can learn from it rather than repress it and continue to grow and be better.   
Question-  
I am debating in a month or so to do one oz of mushrooms or a more tame psilohyausca with about 5grams of mushrooms. I have never done psilohyascua, but as stated I have plenty of experience with higher dosages and do not fear my own mind. Whether you agree with my doing this or not it will happen, so I am here asking for any known advice for my own harm reduction purposes.

2023-05-24 12:39:07,Real life only began after my first psychedelic,"As a young adult in their mid-20s, it is bizarre how I barely remember my life prior to high-school graduation or even the first years of university. As a teacher, I frequently get asked the question ""Why? Did you use to enjoy school so much that you decided to stay here for the rest of your life?"", to which I would always reply with ""No. As a matter of fact, I despised every second in my former classroom, and that is the reason why I am a teacher. Because I want to change that dreadful atmosphere for the new generation, and to make sure that none of you would have to go through what I've experienced.""

But do I actually remember these horrible years of my life? Hard to say.

I know I used to be the total opposite of what I am now. A socially awkward goth kid who used to sit all alone at the front desk, head buried in the books, with no one to hang around with during the breaks, as I literally had no friends. You see, when people claim they 'have no friends', they are most likely exaggerating, because even the geekiest quiet kids have at least one equally as geeky person they could talk to, even for a minute. But me? I had none. Literally. None. I had zero interaction with my classmates, or people outside of school for that matter, and even when I attempted to join a conversation, they would shoot me with the most disgusted glare ever and say ""Why are you talking with us, weirdo?"". Yeah, I was ""the weirdo"" of the class. Why? I had no clue.

I know that most of my lifetime was spent in silence. Thoughts storming my head with nobody to share them with. The only good people I knew were my parents, but not even they could understand the damage that social isolation could do to a child. I know I used to be bullied in high school, and used to come home crying, swearing in my life that one day I would murder every single one of my classmates. At some point I had even made attempts to off myself because I couldn't handle it anymore. But do I actually remember any of this occurring?

No. All of this were stories retold by my parents many, many years later.

My very first vivid memory was somewhere towards the end of my senior high-school years when I met my very first friend who had introduced me to psychedelics. Apparently I've done speed and weed before that, but neither of those substances have had much of an impact on me whatsoever. Speed only fuelled my Eating Disorder (from what I was told, the bullying resulted in me becoming anorexic), while weed made me dumber.

My first psychedelic trip was on LSD at the age of 17. I remember looking into the mirror and seeing myself for who I truly was, or rather, who I was hiding beneath a mask. All the make-up I had on my face made me look like an alien. It was off-putting, this wasn't me. The reserved, 'introverted' personality was merely a shell of who I truly was on the inside, and it cracked. It was as if I had been a mere caterpillar before turning into a pupa, only for the butterfly to finally emerge from its confines. When I took my make-up off, I felt so beautiful, so free, no longer needing to mask myself as the black sheep that I wasn't.

After that experience, I gradually opened up and began making more and more friends, feeding on the happiness that social interaction provided me, adding pleasant memories from all the times I've spent with people, all the parties we've had, all the laughs and cries we've shared, and the bonds we've fromed. After graduation, I would take psychedelics on occasion, and it felt like each and every trip pushed me to grow more and more as a person, destroying every bit of awkwardness I used to carry while, simultaneously, learning to appreciate the world around me and opening my eyes to new viewpoints and new experiences. Nowadays, I cannot imagine a day without talking to people, as I am human after all, and humans are social species. Simply having someone around brings me a sense comfort and joy, while loneliness even for a few hours would send me down a spiral of dread.

Last night I was curious to check my old childhood photos and I found a few class group pictures from high-school. It would be an understatement to say that I couldn't even recognise myself in any of them. That shy goth kid hidden in the back didn't look even remotely similar to me, neither appearance-wise nor expression-wise. They were a stranger, a poser, someone pretending to be me. I couldn't even remember my classmates either, as though all memories had been shrouded in thick fog. I stared at the pictures for a long while, struggling to gain any recollection of what life used to be before, but alas. Everything had been erased from my memory, and all I'm left with are the stories my parents would sometimes tell on family gatherings.

Regardless of what they claim I used to be, I'm a philanthropist, always have been and always will be. Nothing from my past childhood years relates to who I am in reality. Not a single thing, and I thank psychedelics for helping me emerge from the depths of nonexistence and for giving me life. The life of who I truly am. A shameless extrovert in love with the world.",47,5141,8,946,1
2023-05-24 12:39:05,Seeking Book Recommendations for a Meaningful Psilocybin Experience and Indigenous Medicine Exploration,"Hello fellow Redditors! 

I'm an avid seeker of all things beyond the veil and I'm interested in exploring psilocybin for personal growth, healing, and to connect with the source. I am aware but undereducated about psilocybin use in indigenous medicine and practices and want to better learn about this in order to have a deep respect and reverence for the medicine and experience. 

Additionally, I'm interested in learning more about psychedelic-assisted treatments from an indigenous medicine perspective, both as a potential client and as someone pursuing a PsyD in Clinical Psychology. The last thing I want to do is cause more harm by perpetuating colonized ways of thinking and healing so I would love any resources that help me honor the knowledge and wisdom embedded in indigenous healing traditions.

I kindly request your recommendations for books or any other resources that help me on this journey, here are a few categories of resources as examples: 

1. Indigenous perspectives on entheogenic practices and traditional medicine

2. Psychedelic-assisted therapy within indigenous medicine frameworks and current Eurocentric frameworks

3. Personal accounts of transformative experiences with psychedelics and indigenous medicine

4. Guides for safe and responsible exploration of psychedelics

5. Scientific research on psilocybin and its therapeutic potential

2023-05-24 05:17:03,"Mercy for others, mercy for ourselves.","182mg 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine hydrochloride

April 9, 2023

""...I felt the weight of all that accumulated hurt pressing upon me; hurt that generates the perpetration of more hurt, and a vision of a world filled with pain, of people hurting people because of their pain, and a cycle or standing wave of people being hurt and healing from that hurt, over and over again. I saw that there was only one way out, and that was to let it be, and grant mercy. Mercy: or specifically, the voluntary, unilateral suspension of punishment or consequences; or more abstractly, the allowance of the possibility of a future where we need no longer be locked into a struggle against those who wronged us in our pasts. I saw how I must, unavoidably, confront my hurt, my valid grievances against those who wronged me, and grant them mercy, because there is no other way to learn the meaning of the word. For I saw how if I did not know the meaning of mercy, then I shall surely be shown none. This is so, since mercy is something we ultimately grant within us, for ourselves. In particular, I saw how all paths of self-mastery must eventually converge upon a common nexus of healing, where we do finally grant ourselves mercy for doing the very best we could with what we had at the time, both in our pasts and in our present circumstances. We're just people. We're deserving and worthy of mercy and grace. ...""


I am an atheist, but this was one of the most profound spiritual experiences I've ever had, and I did not miss the humorous irony of an atheist having a spiritual ascension on Easter Sunday. Some other things, aside from mercy, that I learned and could comment upon if the curiosity takes hold:

‚Ä¢Struggle to remain
‚Ä¢Mourning the deaths of our former selves
‚Ä¢Confidence
‚Ä¢I'm worthy - of medicine, of healing, of getting what I need to thrive

The above was just an excerpt from my recollections about my experience. This was my first time taking this particular substance. I prepared it myself, for myself. A lot of time, love, effort, and care went into that product. It showed me just how much love I do have inside me, that love isn't something that can be depleted or divided, you simply make more of it. To see that I love myself enough to earnestly try to save myself, and succeed... Yes. This changed my life in a way that exceeds all my past psychedelic experiences.",38,2378,6,424,1

Hey guys, been on here for a while but don't post due to people at my job knowing my Reddit username so I decided to create this throwaway to post some of my trip reports, this one in particular. It was an incredible difficult experience and it's been nearly 2 decades, so I might come back and edit as I remember things or to make it more coherent but I'll try my best the first time around.

PS: Just finished writing it out, I apologize for the length but I honestly don't think its long enough to do the experience justice. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read it.

This is the story of how I witnessed the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks while on LSD

For some background, I was 28 at the time. Relatively healthy male, graduated from a well-known and respected university, and was working for a large aerospace/defense company. My experience with drugs prior to this was pretty standard, including the usual marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, and a few classical psychedelics as well as a variety of research chemicals that were starting to become a little more well known at the time. No habitual use of anything and my psychedelic trips were spread out over about 13 years. This was probably around trip #20 for me, about half of those being LSD.

Set: Overall pretty happy, had recently started an exciting new job. I was visiting some friends in Brooklyn for the week. No serious responsibilities hanging over my head, no stress at all. Ideal set.

Setting: Friends apartment in Brooklyn Heights. I dosed along with my friend who will be named John, and our friend Tim was also present. Tim took either 400 or 600 milligrams of mescaline sulfate. John and I both took LSD. Both drugs were obtained from an extremely reliable source, there was no question about the identity of the chemicals. Those of you around the Berkley area from '93-'99 could probably make a very educated guess as to the source.

I arrived in Brooklyn on Sunday, September 9th, 2001. I got in pretty late, and went to sleep soon after. We knew we were tripping the next day, so we wanted a good night's sleep in preparation. The next day, 9/10, was also mostly spent in preparation. It was Tim's first trip, and he wanted to do the whole 9 yards of preparing. Meditation, fruits and vegetables, exercise, you name it. It was a pretty nice day, and overall very relaxing. We were planning to take our doses at 11:00 PM that night, which is something of a ritual for us. I've never been one to put that much into my pre-trip but I was planning on taking a fairly large dose so I joined him, as did John. The only other drug we ingested that day was marijuana. We all napped from about 5 PM - 9 PM, then showered and did our final preparations.

At 11 PM on September 10th, 2001, Tim took 2 x 200 mg capsules of mescaline sulfate. John and I each took 2x125 ¬µg drops of liquid LSD, totaling 250 ¬µg each. We both planned on taking more later on.

I won't go into great depth for the first part of the trip, because that's not what was important about this trip. It went very smoothly, this acid was extremely clean. It may have been the quickest come-up I've had to date. I had beams of energy shooting out of my knees within 20 minutes. By midnight, an hour after dosing, John and I were both flying, sketching out mock blueprints for ridiculous inventions. The main one that stuck with me was a toaster that butters your bread as its toasted, resulting in optimal caramelization of the solids in the butter. At this point, Tim still wasn't feeling much of anything. This is to be expected with mescaline. Soon enough, he was violently retching in the bathroom, and John and I went up to the roof to give him some space as well as to avoid having to hear his heaving. Some time around 1, Tim stumbled onto the roof from the stairwell with the wildest grin on his face and the largest pupils I have ever seen. He was utterly astounded by the sheer beauty of what he was seeing. We tripped off the view of the Manhattan skyline for a while, and went back downstairs to listen to some music.

Eventually, at around 6 AM on September 11th, our trips started to slow down a bit. John and I each took another 2 drops of LSD, equalling 250 ¬µg and bringing our individual totals to 500 ¬µg. Tim wanted a drop of acid too, but we dissuaded him and said that if he wanted to keep going he should take more mescaline. I gave him another 200 mg capsule but I don't remember if he ended up taking it.

At about 7:30 AM on September 11th we really start to enter a new dimension. The feeling of coming up while coming down is incredibly strange an difficult to describe. It literally felt like being physically pulled in two directions, and each side was being pulled from opposite ends of the universe. We wandered up to the roof and laid down, staring at the sky. It was warm, beautifully sunny, and I felt as though I could feel the whole city waking up, getting ready to go to work, enjoying the sunshine and slight breeze. I felt a strong sense of community with millions of people I had never met. I felt that since we were all experiencing this beautiful day we were all one entity, sharing this divine orgasmic pleasure of sunshine and calm. This feeling was about to be shattered, totally annihilated and replaced with the purest form of terror I have ever known or will ever know.

Their apartment was in Brooklyn Heights, so being on the roof allowed for an incredible view of the Manhattan skyline, in particular the Downtown/ Financial District area. For those of you unfamiliar with the area, we had a direct line of sight across the East River to the World Trade Center. Although we had spent plenty of time staring at it overnight, playing with the lights and bouncing tracers around our fields of vision, we were now laying on our backs. Not much conversation was taking place, or at least not verbally. We all felt very calm and relaxed, or relatively so given the condition we were in.

Then it happened. BOOM. It was almost like a deep, rolling clap of thunder, but the sky was clear. We all jumped up, startled but not really scared. I couldn't articulate it at the time, but I think I thought it was a transformer exploding. I said something like, ""I think that was the electric."" Then I hear John say ""What the fuck..."" I turn around, and there's a huge cloud of black smoke coming out of the North Tower. At the time, it was rippling purple and dark emerald green, creating all sorts of rapidly twisting and changing forms. Animals, geometric patterns, faces, you name it. We didn't know what to make of it. Among the three of us, there was this brief moment of disbelief. Considering the large doses of drugs we were on, we all had to confirm with each other that what we were seeing was actually there. The idea of a transformer exploding was still bouncing around my head, and I think I suggested that maybe it was an electrical explosion. John suggested it might have been a bomb, given the fact that there had already been a bombing attempt. Tim and I both thought it was too high up to have been a bomb.

By now several other people had come onto the roof, and on the streets there were clumps of people gathered at places where they could view the towers. I could instantly read and feel each individual's expression, from bewilderment to astonishment to fear, it was like flipping through a rolodex of emotions.

Suddenly, there was a commotion. People started pointing out towards the towers as if something was happening. I looked up, and as soon as I did the second plane came crashing through the South Tower. It exploded out the other side in insanely vibrant oranges, reds and yellows. I sort of went tunnel-vision on the explosion, it became all encompassing. I could almost feel the radiant heat as if I was surrounded by the fireball. I began to comprehend what was happening, that this was no accident, this was an attack. The understanding of the situation came as a physical feeling. Throughout my whole body, I realized I had just watched at least dozens of people die, if not hundreds.

Then the screams. This is the part that has stuck with me the most, and I will never forget this. Immediately after the second plane blew through the other side of the South Tower, the screams erupted. I have never heard so many people scream at once. It was as if the entire city was screaming in unison. Most of the surrounding rooftops were filled with people, as were the streets below. They all screamed. It pierced my very soul, it caused physical pain as the screams became one, warping and modulating and expanding across the galaxy. Every living being screamed at that moment. An image flashed in my head of a shadowy figure, with a sort of mad scientist aesthetic, clutching a dropper vial. In the vial was pure, distilled terror. Thats what I was hearing. There was no more amazement, no more questioning of what was happening, not even confusion. Just pure terror. When I came out of this state, all I could hear was sirens and sobbing. Everyone who wasn't silent, mouth agape, was crying. Tim, John and I said nothing, we just exchanged looks of disbelief. None of us could articulate a thing at that moment, but it was clear to each of us that we had all just witnessed an event of immense impact and importance. None of us said a word. We just stood and watched the towers burn, the massive cloud of smoke expanding across the horizon, taking on all types of evil, twisted shapes.

This was the most awful thing we ever witnessed, without a doubt. Until an hour later. It felt like eons had passed since we saw the second plane hit, but at around 10 AM the South tower, the one we watched absorb a plane and spit it out the opposite side in a ball of flames, collapsed. Again, the screams. This was beyond all comprehension. We watched that building turn to dust before our very eyes. This massive structure of concrete and steel, just gone within seconds. One minute it was there, the next minute it was tumbling, crystallizing and then shattering and crystallizing then shattering hundreds of times as it went. It was clear that if there was still anyone inside, they were now dead beyond a doubt. This was too much for me. I started to vomit, but there was nothing in my stomach so I just dry heaved on the roof, screaming between retches. I began to question all reality, my mind trying to deny that this could ever happen, that it must be the drug. Please let it just be the drug.

But it just kept getting worse. I started to tumble into a void of terror and confusion, beginning to lose all touch with reality. The words ""why,"" and ""what"" flew around my head, repeating over and over. Then the screams started again. I get up from all fours, and watch as the North Tower follows the other's path. This one appeared to me more like crumbling marble, glittering white and crumbling into billions of pieces, as if watching a marble temple age tens of thousands of years within seconds.

I don't remember much after that. I have a few short flashes from the rest of the day, we mostly just sat around inside in total silence, smoking cigarettes and occasionally crying. We didn't know about the other attacks until later that afternoon, and then we watched the coverage of Building 7 collapsing. This was without a doubt the single most terrifying, terrible day of my life. I'm struggling for words to describe it, but its impossible. The psychedelic experience in and of itself is impossible to describe, let alone witnessing something so traumatic, transformative and historical. I'm going to wrap this up now, as it has been incredibly difficult to write. I may come back and edit it at some point but I'm not ready yet. This has been the first time I've ever written about this experience in detail, and although it was hard I think it has been beneficial to me.",37,12050,8,2186,1
2015-12-22 15:13:32,Went to a Donald Trump speech on acid SUPER BAD VIBES,"It was a stupid idea to begin with honestly. First my friends wanted to go to the Trump rally just for fun even when they don't support his ideas. Then in the car on the way there one of my friends tells me he just got a hold of some acid and that it would be hilarious to be tripping at a Donald Trump speech, just to say we did it n that it'll be funny story to look back on. So we all just say fuck it and drop 2 hits each. Bad idea. We walk into the place and just know that something is very wrong. The tension in the air was flowing through our bodies, everyone looked angry about something. 10 minutes pass and we all realize we must escape from this hell on earth before we lose every ounce of sanity we have left. We head for the exits, it's packed with people and security. WE WONT MAKE IT! We all agree and head back to our seats. (We could've made it we were just tripping too hard to be rational) Trump comes out and the whole building starts shaking with chants of USA! USA! USA! It was proud patriotism with an undertone of depraved violence, you could feel it. We all look at each other with the most dreadful look in our eyes knowing we just fucked ourselves into oblivion. I might post the rest of the story later when I have time 

Edit: Rest of story: I put both my arms around my friends and tell them I love them deeply and that we will make it through this experience together, like always. This seemed to reassure my friends a little and it also gave me a sense of comfort that I had 2 trustful companions by my side, even if their minds were being fucked beyond measure at the moment. If anything, genuine trust and unconditional love was the only savior we had left.

The peak started intensify about 5 minutes  (or was it 5 seconds) into his speech. We were sitting on the left side (ground level) about 150 feet away from Mr trump. Got a terrific view of his exquisite hairpiece in person that seemed to have a mind of its own as it was breathing and taking on different forms throughout the whole speech. The visuals were up to par with around 200 ug in my experience, some rare strong street acid, just my luck in this situation. My mind begins to wander as I stop forwarding my conscious attention to his rhetoric and start observing people in the crowd. Started to think about how weird the human race is. 

The woman in front of me had brought 5 of her kids to this rowdy cesspool. All her kids kept glancing and staring at us. One peeked around the corner of his stroller stared straight into my fucking soul for I don't know how long and then proceeds to point out how big my pupils are. ""Mommy, look how big his eyes are. The Mother hears it glances at me with the most heinous expression on her face, she definitely knew.

I Start paying attention to Trump again and his face starts to subtly melt. The melting intensifies until his face looks like a wax statue thrown into a furnace. I point this out to my friends and they start seeing it. Try holding back laughter on 2 hits of strong acid, it doesn't work and we burst out laughing while Mr Trump is speaking, he pauses his speech but doesn't pay us any mind as we cover our mouth quickly. Everyone around us knew we were on something though. 

Protesters in the crowd kept yelling things and were getting dragged out by security. Lol one guy yells ""TRUMP DID 9/11! open your eyes to the truth"" This is when I realized the opposition is just as idiotic as the supporters. As a country we are digging our own graves. I start to look at myself and fell into a deep state of personal introspection. What was the motive for me taking this action anyway? Why was I here at a trump rally on 2 hits of LSD? Was I searching for some hidden truth by way of chemicals? Or was I here for good fun? I was just as irrational as the others I looked down upon. 


You know how sometimes YOU have ""moments of eternity"" on LSD. Yeah well that was happening all night, the speech felt like it kept looping over and over and over and over and over. Muslims this, guns this, illegals that, something about Hilary Clinton being disgusting by using the restroom. Then every 5 minutes after a bold statement, the crowd erupts into mindless cheers and applause. Endless time loop. This when I actually convinced myself that I was living out the novel 1984. I genuinely believed this. Trump was big brother HOLY SHIT AN EPIPHANY. TRUMP IS BIG BROTHER. Yeah this when the trip started to take a bad turn again but wait a miracle. THE LOOP IS OVER. WE'RE SAVED. THE DEVIL IS DONE WITH HIS RHETORIC. The speech was over. we can get out of this zoo now. We figure we're all too fucked up to drive so we call someone to pick us up. After that we had a deep discussion about politics, America, Philosophy, Trumps hairpiece and how incredibly idiotic we are.

2020-04-10 09:40:40,The craziest thing about a spiritual awakening is that nobody cares about your spiritual awakening.,"I did LSD when I was 18 year old, and in that year I did LSD 3 more times. 2 of those trips entailed an intense and absolutely mind shattering ego death experience. 

The past two years I‚Äôve thought about those experiences every single day of my life. It is constantly on my mind. I meditated with the feelings I‚Äôve had, studied more philosophy and researched on some people that know about the things that I had experienced, mostly Alan Watts. 

I can feel the absurdity of existence, and how absolutely profound every second of reality is. 

I can feel how separation is an illusion, and that every life that is being lived are just different masks for god. 

I‚Äôve realised the absolutely indescribable understanding of this entire happening. I‚Äôve felt that empty-fullness. The up and down, self and other. 

And when I try my best to explain these concepts to those I feel comfortable enough to, I know they can‚Äôt really relate in any way. It‚Äôs so strange, how I‚Äôve realised all of this and everything is just the same. 

I didn‚Äôt expect nor do I desire for people to treat me differently or magically understand, but there‚Äôs another layer of absurdity to it all. 

On top of that, I‚Äôm really still the same. I‚Äôm just a twenty year old guy, that spends too much time playing video games and stressing about all the responsibilities I‚Äôm putting off.",99,1351,15,239,1

2016-06-29 00:04:56,I am a psychonaut. I am dead.,"This is not MercurialMan. This is his wife. Or rather, his widow.

MercurialMan identified as a psychonaut. I don't know how active he was in this subreddit, honestly, but it's on his feed, so here I am. He enjoyed doing strong hallucinogens for the purpose of spiritual exploration. I never liked doing anything more than light shrooms myself, and just for kicks, so this sort of thing wasn't for me. It was clear,though, that it brought him great satisfaction. He would trip while I was out of the house, which always made me nervous, but he showed me the extensive research he did, and I trusted that he was an adult who made his own decisions. 

I came home late one night, and found him dead. I don't know exactly what he took, but I know the website he bought it from, and it looked like some pretty experimental shit. I flushed what I found down the toilet. The autopsy report showed psilocin in his system, and 37 self-inflicted stab wounds with damage to almost all of his major organs. Thirty seven. 

I'm not here to be preachy or say don't do drugs. Your lives are none of my business and can do whatever the fuck you want. I just have so many questions. What could be so intense to cause someone to destroy themselves so completely? What is it like to be so far out of your mind as to lose control and feel no pain? Is chasing this high worth it? Is it worth dying for?

2019-08-21 09:40:36,Who wants to try an experiment,"Here's what we do. If you're reading this right now, follow these steps as soon as you wake up tomorrow.

1. Wake up, drink water.

2. Don't use your phone. Don't disturb your peace. Turn off and avoid all technology.

3. Make some tea :)

4. Write, read different books, exercise, meditate, play an instrument, go outside, soak in the sun, chill with the trees, sing, rap, poetry, paint, draw, build, CREATE.

5. Do this when you're not flipping burgers or waiting tables. And suddenly those jobs won't be so terrible. Suddenly your mind is clear and you are able to bring fun into any situation.

6. Don't allow any screen time. Maybe one movie every few nights. Suddenly those movies are oddly more engaging and trippy. Almost feels like a dream.

7. Don't listen to individual songs, listen to albums you've never heard. And don't drown yourself in music. Respect the album, respect the music and take the time to fully soak it in. 

8. Avoid social media, reddit, youtube, safari, chrome, all of that. There's nothing to see here. Maybe a few great lectures and documentaries, but nobody watchin those anyways. 

9. Avoid all processed foods. All of it. Some people suggest going vegan and im currently experimenting with it but don't know how it'll go. Our ancestors used to kill for survival and they used to bless the animal before they killed it. What we're doing now doesn't feel the same. But then again im no nutritionalist so don't take me so seriously. Im jus experimenting with my mind n body right now and you should too.

10. Break out of the matrix

11. Blue Light toxicity is connected to Leaky Gut. The more time you spend in front of blue light from phones and laptops the more you damage your gut. Autoimmune issues are caused not only by blue light but the magnetic field around it as well. So airplane mode or better yet go old school. 

12. We are all addicted to something. Terrible Toxic Food, Technology, Porn, Drugs, Houses, Apartments, Coffee, etc etc etc

2020-07-17 20:03:19,"Please stop encouraging strangers on the internet to take Psychedelics, when you know almost nothing about them.","Everyday someone posts on this forum asking if they should trip on their own when they have little to no experience. And everyday I see people saying ‚ÄúYes, this is the only way I trip, you will be fine, just go for it man‚Äù - or some variation on this.

&#x200B;

What I don‚Äôt see, are enough people, asking further questions before giving feedback. Some basic questions which should be asked first , are:

&#x200B;

* How old are you?
* How much experience do you have, if any?
* Do you live at home with your parents, and do you plan to trip with them there?
* Are you taking any medications?
* Do you have any issues with mental heath, or does anyone in your family have any issues with mental health?

&#x200B;

The answer to those questions, and others, should absolutely change how you reply.

&#x200B;

For example, what if the OP is 16 years old, has never tried a psychedelic, they have mental health issues, and are living with their abusive parents. They plan on eating a 5+ grams of cubensis mushrooms on a school night because they read somewhere it might help him.

&#x200B;

Okay, this example is a perfect storm of terrible ideas (all real examples I have seen posted on this forum), but my point is, we should all be replying completely differently to a person in the above scenario, than you would reply to someone who is 27 years old, clear bill of mental health, and has done mushrooms 10 times before, and is thinking about trying 2gs of cubensis, alone in his bedroom, in his flat which he shares with two trusted friends, who are in the other room if he needs support.

&#x200B;

The point being, if you don't ask the OP to clarify their situation, you have no idea if your advice is in anyway sensible.

&#x200B;

I understand, most peoples hearts are in the right place when they offer their advice, they are imagining a scenario where the OP has an amazing life changing trip, and they will be eternally grateful for following the advice.

This is a beautiful thought, but it is simply reckless, you won‚Äôt be there to pick up the pieces and deal with the aftermath if things go bad. And things can go bad. People are risking their mental and physical health when taking psychedelics.

&#x200B;

If you don‚Äôt believe this, or you think this hugely over exaggerated to the point where it basically doesn't happen, then you are mistaken. Just because you haven‚Äôt met them, you need to understand, numerous people have suffered short or long term negative effects from a psychedelic trip gone awry.

&#x200B;

We do also get people posting on this forum everyday, with warnings of their bad experiences, and the problems they had to deal with afterwards - yet it seems, many people are just not taking it seriously.

&#x200B;

I really truly believe in the good psychedelics can do for the individual, and our culture at large. But they need to be taken with respect and care.

&#x200B;

Please don‚Äôt encourage people to take psychedelics if you don‚Äôt know anything about them, especially don‚Äôt recommend they take them on their own with no sitter or guidance until they have some experience at least.

&#x200B;

I would love to see more people considering the impact of their advice to others. Lots of the newbies posting are simply looking for one or two people to give them the go ahead before they go ahead with their poorly thought out plan, they come here looking for validation to do something reckless.

&#x200B;

Harm reduction should be all of our priorities when offering psychedelic advice to people with limited experience. If we can educate psychedelic users on harm reduction and foster this mentality among all of us,  we would be helping protect our most vulnerable in the short term, and we would be helping the larger cause of getting psychedelics legalized and accepted into mainstream culture.

&#x200B;

Can you imagine a world where psychedelic substances, centers and retreats are available to all who might want or need them? And they would all be staffed by knowledgeable and experienced people who can guide, protect and help people integrate their experiences? This is what we need to be fighting for.

I‚Äôm getting closer to my goal now. God I love it. 

My best moments seem to be by myself. I used to practice this by setting at the bus stop in Seattle. Nobody sees people at a bus stop. Sometimes I would actually get on the bus. Life on the bus was intense as there are people that travel back and forth to nowhere. They live on these metro busses. My son found his first girlfriend riding the buses. 

I was reflecting on how many people live on this planet this evening. Lots. Each of us are another you. We are God experiencing EVERYTHING. Heaven and Hell is right here.

 I have found the way to be in the Heaven part. Treat others, all beings, as another you. We are all equal. I also experience my personal hell.

2021-08-25 04:07:45,"Psychedelics don't always have to be a serious, introspective spiritual experience. Sometimes just appreciating nature with friends and giggling about stupid stuff is the most spiritual experience you can have","I absolutely respect the power of psychedelics, and don't abuse them to escape reality. In fact I don't really even use them at all anymore.

When I was younger I fell into the whole erowid shaman thing. I'd preach to everyone about how sacred psychedelics are and how they're ONLY to be used as medicine in a ceremony setting. I'd see my peers taking shrooms and just giggling and having fun in a field and thought they were disrespecting the medicine and that they should learn something (aka, my ego has been inflated by ego death, and therefore my ego tells me others need to have the same experience as me to be EnLiGhTeNeD)

But as I got older I started to realize that having fun and laughing with loved ones IS the most important and spiritual experience there is. Psychedelics taught me not to take life so seriously and to just enjoy it because nobody can really solve the mysteries of the universe. A spiritual experience isn't just shamanic contemplation and introspection, it's experiencing love beauty and appreciation for the world and others. Love is the greatest possible spiritual experience, and taking life too seriously is the antithesis of spirituality. A purely recreational experience is just as spiritual as contacting entities or experiencing ego death. Fun, love and laughter literally feed the spirit and its totally okay to enjoy a trip without serious intention, ceremony and meditation",209,1416,30,238,1

2020-09-03 17:16:17,Growing up is literally just un-learning everything that we've been taught is important.,"Here in the west, people's priorities are so fucked. I suppose it's a manifestation of feeding the ego, but ever since I was a child, I didn't understand why being rich and popular and beautiful meant so much to people. That was before the teen years, when I inevitably fell into the peer pressures surrounding me. I thought I had to be perfect to mean anything at all to the world, and I definitely was far from it. But now that I'm almost 20, everything has sort of begun to make sense (with the help of psychedelics ofc).

The only thing that matters is realizing that it doesn't matter. There is no final destination. You don't have to do something just because you were told to do so. There is no ""you,"" really. There's nothing to be afraid of. 

All that exists is the now, and even that is so fleeting and incomprehensible. But in all of its inherent chaos, I trust the universe, which includes myself and all of you and everything else. I trust it not to guarantee my happiness, but to follow its natural flow. We were all taught to be control freaks in a sense, but control is an illusion. When you let go, everything falls into place.",88,1144,13,212,1
2020-12-28 05:19:07,I think the ultimate realization is that psychedelics aren't anything special either.,"When people first get into psychedelics and encounter ego death, they may have all sorts of realizations about reality. A common one is that they realize that they have been living a lie. That the physical realm and the ego is like a hamster wheel. The ego attaches itself to imaginary goals and chases things externally in order to make itself feel complete. It comes in many shapes and forms, for some people it's money, success, and or fame. For other it's drugs or sex or love. But regardless of your ego's poison of choice, the mechanism at play is the same. The ego feels incomplete so it must attach itself and attain external goals in order to be ""happy"" and content.

Here's the problem: a lot of people who wake up to this illusion, merely fall into another trap. They continue to take psychedelics and follow the ""spiritual path"" to reach ""enlightenment"". The irony is that they don't see what is happening: they merely just changed what their ego was chasing. Before it was physical pleasures like money or sex, and now it's ""enlightenment"" or ""transcendence"". Do you not see what is happening here? You're playing the same game. You remain stuck on the hamster-wheel. Still confused.

Allow me to lay it out. The psychedelic or spiritual ""realm""‚Äî whatever it is‚Äîis just as illusory as this one. It's all the same. There is no ultimate truth or enlightenment to attain, and the longer you chase it the longer you remain confused. Like a dog chasing their own tail. There is only 1 solid truth to be realized, and you already know what it is so there is no need to go searching for it. That truth is ""I am."" The one undeniable, indestructible truth. It requires no belief, no faith, and no evidence. It relies on absolutely nothing whatsoever. You are.

Consciousness itself. Being. The stillness. The void. The empty awareness that follows you everywhere you go. That's your enlightenment right there. You have it already. All else is an illusion. Everything that isn't that is Maya. Magic. Everything else merely appears inside it and eventually disappears. It can't be grasped or held onto. The only real reality is the ever-present emptiness. If you quiet your mind and quit your chasing and let everything go for long enough you will see this. Then there is nothing left to do. Just be.",85,2302,12,402,1

You're in control of your own mind and your own thoughts, the only reason a bad day happened was because you let it (unless of course something actually really bad happened).

Gotta stay on top it and when you think you're having a bad day, take a step back, take a big breathe in and start thinking of all those great positive things that happened today and what has made your day great, besides that one or two minor things that were negative. You can always outweigh positives from negatives. Not saying ignore the negative things, but embrace it for what it is, acknowledge it and then move on from it!

Even if it's the little things you have to look at; grateful for being healthy, grateful for a roof over my head, grateful for the family I have, grateful to be on this journey.

I grew up learning to keep my head down. To know my place. To always take care of others. To disregard my own needs. Feelings are Western and upper-class luxury. My whole purpose is to just work to feed people. Mainly my father, who lost his job because of Covid-19, and also my girlfriend, whose small business  is all but destroyed from the pandemic.

I told the guy I was working with the story and my boss over heard. Anyways he doesn't bring it up for months, then one day gets drunk and tells my dad and step mom that im ""addicted"" to acid and take it at work. My step mom confronts me in tears. We'll call my boss Joe.

Our conversation went something like this.

My step mom said ""Joe came by today told us about your little drug problem."" 

""What are you talking about?""

""Your taking acid?! Are you fucking serious, that shit fries your brain. Do you wanna be brain dead? Do you know how dangerous that stuff is?""

""Dangerous? Far less dangerous then the ADHD meds you guys forced me to take when I was 8 that i became dependent on for 10 years. No more dangerous then the 6 beers my dad drinks every night. Whats so dangerous about LSD, have you ever done it?""

""Once but id never do it again, I may have smoked a little pot, or even done a little coke here and there but acid changes you. I can tell you've changed! If you wanna ruin your life you won't be living here!""

""Yea I can tell you feeling at one with the universe, more empathetic, and pure bliss is REAL dangerous. And yea it changed me. It made me realize I was an alcoholic and a pint of whisky a day is gunna kill me. Made me realize that cocaine isn't worth the money. Helped me to understand that smoking pot every 30 minutes every day burns me the fuck out. Made me realize I can get through life without ADHD meds if i just put the extra work in. Made me want to eat better and treat myself right. Helped me to love myself and to forgive myself. Made me want to be closer to my family. Helped give me the confidence to stand up for myself and what I belive in. And helped me to realize how much I appreciate being alive. So yea I guess you can say acid changed me. I don't do acid in your house, I don't bring it into your house, ive never been on it around you, and its only made me a better person. Y'all never wanted to talk to me or get me a therapist when I was younger. I've been working through this shit by myself. I'm working my ass off and giving you money every week. You didnt even have a problem until you found out I do acid so can't you just let me be. You should really do some research before you go hating on LSD.""

She stood there staring angrily then went in to tell my dad. I heard my dad jokingly say ""I don't give a shit hes 21, he works and pays us, maybe the acid did make him more responsible."" I was super shocked because my dad is also a super anti drug person. I never heard anything else about it from my step mom after that. And I confronted my boss about my ""acid addiction"" and told him how rediculous that was. He of course denied ever saying anything to parents, then went on to say he might of but he was drunk so he didnt remember.

Yesterday, 4/29/21, I ran 13.4 miles while on acid. I want to write about it because honestly, I've never experienced anything like I did yesterday and it was such an amazing experience. I've done acid a lot over the past few years, but almost every time I did it it was in a party environment or on my own in a bedroom. I love running, like a lot. Like when I think of myself as a person the first thing that pops up in my head to describe myself to others is that I'm a runner. Not a very good runner, but a runner who loves to run.

I really had no goals in mind with this run other than to be as careful as I could and to just enjoy myself. To enjoy my feet below me carrying me wherever I will them too. I didn't have a time limit I barely took any precautions. I had never done anything like this before. It was all very spur of the moment and I hardly did any planning or preparing whatsoever.

I got up for work at 3:15 am and got home from work around 6:40 pm. I knew that I was going to be tired and that I'd need to take the acid as soon as I got home so that I could still be running when the acid finally hit me. I started my run just after 7 pm Thursday afternoon.

Miles 1-3 They felt very similar to the beginning of every run. I wasn't tripping yet so I mostly focused on stretching my legs out and keeping a slow and easy pace. I followed the train tracks out of my small rural town that I live in and just kept running beside them for miles. Until the closest road was over 3 miles away and I was just in farmland.

Mile 4 About an hour or so after I took the acid. I could feel it coming on now and just felt incredibly light, happy, and proud. I was proud that I was running. I was proud that I worked an entire day and still decided to run a half marathon. I was proud of this crazy little trip I decided to take.

Mile 5-6 This is my favorite part of my run. I was surrounded by nature. River, swamp, farmland, open sky. For a brief moment, it all felt like mine. It felt right. I didn't want to leave but the sun was going down and I needed to make it home because I left my headlamp at home because I was in such a rush to start my run. Before I reached my halfway point I saw a white tail deer running like 25-30 yards to my north and ran with her for a while. I tried to get a picture of her or a video but I couldn't because I am stupid lol. [Snapchat video of my favorite part](https://imgur.com/gallery/7v2ADhJ)

Mile 7-8 I was tripping. I ran along the train tracks and was mesmerized by the long golden grains of grass following the breeze in the wind. They all looked the same to me. Every piece standing tall and proud reaching towards the sky and the breeze from the south and east blowing them in the same direction of my home. I followed the dancing grass. I watched the birds take off on flight in front of me. I watched them jet off into the sky and effortlessly carry themselves on the wind. I felt very similar to them. Their wings are to them and the sky as my legs are to me and the ground.

Miles 9-11 The train tracks brought me up alongside small bodies of water and it was really, really hard to focus on my running because each wave and ripple on the water just grabbed my attention. Demanded that I look at it and appreciate the beauty I found myself alone and surrounded by. During this portion of the run, I would fall 4 times. 2 hard falls and a cracked phone screen made me realize I was flying. I wasn't jogging or slowly running I was straight up sprinting and I didn't even realize it. Running fast while sober is great and fun. Running fast while on acid is on another level completely. The sun was going down and I was bleeding, cold, excited, and happy.

Miles 12-13 I was coming back into town. Following the sunset. The incredible colors painted in the sky and the clouds make me wish I could paint because I feel the only way I'd be able to describe this sunset is on canvas. The blues slowly turning into various shades of purples, pinks, oranges, reds, and yellows was a perfect view to follow back into town. The smells and sights once I was back in town were very different from the rest of my run understandably. I ran along the train tracks towards the old co-op. Before I got there I had to run behind a gasoline station and I could smell the fried chicken and cheese curds they had for sale the smells filled me up and encouraged me to run home so that I could make french fries. By the dumpsters behind the gasoline station were piles of sand and cigarette butts from where the ashtrays were dumped. I felt sad and also proud. I felt sad because I used to be a part of that group. I used to smoke from 15-23 I have just quit smoking a little over 3 months ago. Running past those piles of cigarette butts helped remind me that me quitting smoking wasn't just going to have a positive impact on my life but all of the lives around me. I'm proud that I quit smoking and I will say that it is hard and it sucks at times, but that it's worth it just like running is to all of us.

Miles .4 Running. I did not want to stop but the sun was going down and even though for me it is normal to run and to sometimes do acid I'd never mixed both before. I didn't want the fun to stop but I knew that my neighbors wouldn't appreciate a crazy young man running around the streets after dark while he was tripping balls on acid. So I did the only other thing I could do. I went home and hopped in the shower to wash the blood, sweat, dirt, and rust off of my exhausted body. Guys before I hopped in the shower I stood naked in front of my mirror and was so happy. I looked at my body, my face, my legs. I felt so proud of myself. Of the power in my legs. The goofy smile I had melted onto my face. I have never in my life felt as happy as I did standing in front of my mirror naked, coming down from this incredible runner's high, and watching the walls and ceiling breathe with me.

I watched documentaries after my shower and before falling asleep. I think what I learned the most from yesterday is that I take too much for granted and that I don't appreciate what I have. I am very lucky and I believe so are most of you.

I think that if I never do acid again I'd be okay with it because yesterday, honestly was life-changing and I need more time to analyze myself and to keep doing what drives me.

Before I forget I listened to music and some of the songs that I listened to that I want to share with y'all.

2021-07-19 18:30:23,Was asked to help bury a dead horse while peaking on 5 grams of psilocybin tea.,"
I live on a farm and thought I had my set and setting all worked out. Made 5 grams of dried cubensis tea, did some stretching, put on a meditation for the come up and settled in with an eye mask in bed with comfy pajamas. About an hour in as I‚Äôm peaking, right after crying my face off because I love my friends and family so much that my heart exploded, I get a phone call from my mother in law who also lives on the farm. I asked how she was doing and she said not good, and that one of the horses on the farm was dying and asked if I could watch her dog. Then she said ‚ÄúI think he just died‚Äù and hung up. 

Jesus Christ I was tripping, so I did my best to get dressed and went outside to watch the dogs. The dogs were being dogs, but I got the feeling something bad would happen to them so I put them inside. One had a stick in his mouth and I thought it was going through his eye socket but luckily it was just me being really high on mushrooms, he was fine. Then I walked over to where the horse was. My sister in law is his owner and she was there with her assistants and they were all crying. I looked at the horse and it looked just terrible, definitely a dead horse. I started to calm down and just decided I was here and I will do my best to help so I asked what I could do. She asked if I could help bury it  and I said sure. So she left and for a while it was just me and the dead horse. It was easy to see the situation for what it was, that a being‚Äôs soul had simply rejoined the great emptiness that holds this illusion of form and it was nothing to be sad about, but obviously don‚Äôt say that to people and pretend like it‚Äôs a big deal and it‚Äôs very sad. So anyway the horse and I were there together for a while, then my mother in law came by and I picked her some chamomile from my garden and told her how to make some tea with it. 

Then her cousin came with a backhoe and I had to roll the dead horse into the bucket. Man, they‚Äôre heavy. Then we drove it out to a big hole and dumped it in and he said he would take care of burying it. So I walked away straight into the woods. It was rainy and foggy and it was just a moss, fern, and fungi bonanza in out there. It was great, I spent a lot of time hugging trees and telling the different plants and mushrooms they were doing a great job, really connected with the earth. By the time I left the woods I was in the afterglow and had a fun story to tell my wife as well as some good perspective on impermanence, attachment, and a sense that if you spend life just showing up for things and doing your best to make life better for everyone you‚Äôll probably have a pretty joyful experience while you‚Äôre here on earth in a human body.",79,2698,16,555,1
2020-08-02 12:40:53,Reality is God tripping balls and DMT is the ultimate trip stopper,"Hello fellow human beings!

I tried DMT for the first time a few days ago and holy smokes, I was blown away. 

I‚Äôll write a real and in depth trip report at some point, but for the time being I would love to share a realization/piece of insight I had from my experience.

What hit me the strongest was that despite never trying DMT before, I‚Äôd already been there before. I‚Äôm uncertain about nearly everything in life, yet I‚Äôm certain that wherever I was, it felt like home in a weird way. 
At one point during the trip I realized I was back home, and I couldn‚Äôt understand where I‚Äôd been this whole time. I was outside of time and space, in the emptiness where I‚Äôd always been. Amidst the total chaos, I suddenly heard a comforting voice tell me that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been here, it‚Äôs been me this whole time‚Äù. Although this voice was speaking at me, it was implied that this voice was in fact me. Not the limited self, separated by the physical body, but the deep down me that transcends the material world.

Suddenly it dawned upon me. Reality is the trip/dream and DMT is the trip stopper. I‚Äôll be using the word God here, but I simply mean that as a metaphor for the ineffable mystery of existence. Or the deep down reality, whatever that means. 

When we smoke DMT, God (who is all of us) wakes up from the dream of life. Initially he‚Äôs confused, until he finds himself. He found himself when he told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here this whole time‚Äù.  He‚Äôd been there the whole time, he‚Äôs just been dreaming he was an earthworm and a butterfly and a silly human being.

I‚Äôve been meditating and practicing yoga for a couple years now after I (with total humility) had my awakening a few years ago. The realization I had on DMT wasn‚Äôt anything new per se, just another example of directly experiencing my true nature. Nothing is as beautiful as this cosmic oneness.

I like comparing a spiritual awakening to God lucid dreaming. God discovers himself in us.

Life is so insanely beautiful and I hope we can all get better at not losing touch of the utter magic and wonder that permeates every moment. 

I love you all so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",66,2116,12,390,1
2020-01-29 04:48:13,"Right now it's unconfirmed, but Santa Cruz (California) might have just voted to decriminalize all psychedelics.","**Edit:** The title of this post is inaccurate, I should have used the word ""natural"" instead of ""all"". Rumors on Twitter about this were a bit too excited, but I should have read more into the phenomenon before posting. Nonetheless, let's celebrate *another win for cognitive liberty.*

2021-01-16 07:25:40,Unusually old trip guy report.,"A few weeks ago I talked about using magic mushrooms as a 71 year old.  Acid and MDA in my twenties but nothing since then.

After using 14 grams of the mushrooms, I felt that it would be a good idea to continue using them.  I read quite a bit, and so I decided that the trips should be spaced out with a month or two between them.

So my second 14 gram order was for a more potent type of mushroom, penis envy.  I used 2.15 grams, and did I mention my first trip happened 2 days ago?  Wow, it was powerful!  Nothing negative, but not exactly an easy ride.  I was left with the sense that even though I haven't exactly loved this experience of my current life, it is a very special opportunity to be alive here.  It's one of those ideas that sound obvious when you read it but profound when you experience it during the mushroom trip.

I know that many of you are using this plant to reveal certain truths to aid your understanding but as an old dude I'm focused on encouraging neural plasticity in my brain.  I've already seen how my old brain has exhibited noticeable creative thinking and problem solving in the weeks when the magic mushroom entered my world. And I feel less scared about the fact that I am going to die sooner than later.

One last thought.  Most of you are fairly young I believe, but you don't have to join the masses who gradually fall asleep as they age. I have always had a fierce desire to know the truth on all levels, and at the age of 71 that desire hasn't faded one tiny bit.",30,1506,5,289,1
2021-04-12 19:31:48,I took some LSD and realized being happy is my baseline,"Title says it all. I'm not stressed, anxious or depressed. That's not the real me. Who I am inside. This profound love and happiness that I feel when I'm on psychedelics, *that* is me. It's always there, but it just gets buried underneath all the stress, dysphoria, my past, you know the drill. And I can feel all that love and happiness without psychedelics too - I just need to tap into that.

I'm probably rambling incoherently (English isn't my first language) but I just wanted to say that I love you all, and that you are enough. I hope you all get to feel that warmth, love and happiness now and every day :)",55,615,11,115,1
2020-04-27 15:38:14,"You are not a loser! If you've lost your job or life isn't going the way you thought, just remember it gets better. Don't judge yourself by our society's warped standards of success.","Our identities get so tied up with our jobs and our career success that it can feel like the end of the world when we lose our job or our career isn't progressing as we imagined it would.  Our hyper achievement focused society pressures us until we are burnt out, then makes us feel like losers when we don't live up to it's absurd standards of success.

I personally had a major identity crises when I lost my job in 2016 because I had based so much of my self-worth on my career success.  Suddenly I was unemployed, constantly being rejected by companies, and just felt like a loser.

So I took a break, lived in my van for about 4 months, and just went to festivals and ate psychedelics.  I was burnt out and needed it.  What it really showed me, though, is how warped my values had become.  I was making good money, but I never really had a relationship with anyone.  I hadn't even seen my mom in 2 years.  

I thought I was winning at life because I was successful in my career and making money, but after taking time to reflect with the help of psychedelics, I looked more like a loser that valued nothing but money and pleasure.  

So I slowly changed.  I'm still working on myself, but I really think psychedelics helped me.  I don't make as much money now, but I live a much more simple and content life.  I reconnected with loved ones, got married, had a kid.  I'm broke af, but I'm much more contented with a life surrounded by people that love me.  Even working a tedious job is more fulfilling when I'm doing it to support my family, rather than just pursuing personal pleasure. 

So don't judge yourself by the standards of a twisted world.  You are not a loser!  The real losers are the ones that value nothing but material goods and social status.  Focus on loving those around you better and life will get better.  Sometimes what feels like the end of the world is just the beginning of a better one.",182,1917,33,356,1
2019-03-24 12:57:36,A 60s Acid Freak,"I started using psychedelics when I was 19 and I‚Äôm 70 now, so they haven‚Äôt changed me, they are me. 

I‚Äôm very introverted but not in a weird way. People don‚Äôt freak me out, I‚Äôm just reflecting on things. Sometimes just being sucks my breath away. If I can be alone and force myself to relax, I‚Äôm swept away in bliss. In my head is pure, clean, positive energy with this body wrapped around it. It‚Äôs always been there for all of us, it‚Äôs just that we take it for granted. 

When I decided to become an acid freak I sold my VW to my brother for $50 and hitchhiked to Berkeley where I hung out in the streets until I met a friend of a chemist. $50 for 50 hits of the best lsd made. I don‚Äôt know how strong it was but one pill would create ego death in me every time. I began using lsd every four days, selling 25 of them for $2 each, and when I was getting low head back to Berkeley for more. 

I headed south down highway 1 along the California coast. I‚Äôm a loner, so if I had a choice I would sleep in the bushes rather than a house. 

I would let men and women use my body as they wished. The men would think they needed to give me money; most women wanted me to be more aggressive. Sex was not something I chased. 

My sole possession was a cheap sleeping bag and the clothes I wore. I was once in Monterey CA wandering around when I found a Goodwill box where people could drive up and drop off their old clothes without getting out of their car. I found a way inside and when people opened the hatch to drop off their rejects they would see my face and I would thank them for their donation. The strange looks I got were cool and I left with some nice clean clothes including a leather jacket. 

I now have all of the exterior appearances of a normal person. Nobody around me knows I‚Äôm still using psychedelics. I take gigantic doses every three to four days if time allows. I have to keep it totally secret as most people are incapable of understanding me. I‚Äôm a freak but also a survivor. 

I can listen to others when they talk. My job is to help others find the path of least resistance in solving problems. Most believe they must fight upstream to find what they want - there is nothing I want upstream. But I can‚Äôt tell others that, I have to guide them there. 

One of the strangest trips I had started out in the women‚Äôs dorm at Princeton in NJ. My girlfriend‚Äôs best friend was attending there and the three of us dropped lsd (almost all the lsd was in pill form back then, so we ‚Äòdropped‚Äô them down our throats). 

My gf loved Jimi Hendrix and had one of his records playing.  I became one with the music, actually transformed into the musical energy and came out of a speaker in San Francisco, in a coffee cafe where they were playing the same song. I materialized in the middle of the room. 

The room became deathly quiet with everyone looking at me. Someone said ‚Äúwhere the fuck did you come from?‚Äù  I was way too stoned to talk so I just went outside. 

Outside I walked to the Haight-Ashbury district. Hippies were everywhere and I was getting major trails from the cars driving. I remembered I was on lsd and told myself to relax. I sat down with my back against a storefront, put my head against my knees, and was transported into a place where my lsd teacher lived. 

This is a creature that I often visited when peaking. I was afraid of him and would always listen carefully. Most of those visits I was not allowed to remember. This time though he told me to NEVER give lsd to my girlfriend again and I had perfect memory of the moment, even to this day. 

That morning my girlfriend and I went out to a private place to watch the sunrise over Princeton. As the lights came on and the sky turned, a comet hung in the sky. The two of us conceived our first born that morning. Sitting there I told her I was going back to the city and ‚Äòmake it.‚Äô  Took me awhile. ~merlin",16,3891,4,750,1
2023-04-04 00:45:36,I gave my dying father 5g of dried mushrooms.,"I'm just about back to baseline, whatever that really means, from a mushroom trip. 

My dad is dying of stage 4 cancer, he has a few weeks left to live. I gave him 5g of dried mushrooms yesterday and today I took the remaining 2g.  

It's been around 2 years since I last tripped on DMT and I have dabbled, albeit not all that often, on most pysc's. 

I treat most of my trips as meditation practices and this was no different, instead this time I sat in front of a full sized mirror and set my focus as my reflection. 

There is an aspect to tripping that you always forget after and only when you're back in it do you realize 'Oh yea, fuck...this is what it's like.' It can be psilocybin, LSD, DMT, they all invoke a perspective that is usually unattainable yet is so cross relative to each other. The confrontation I call it, when you come face to face with it again, can always feel daunting. 

The come up was pretty quick, I had fasted for close to 20 hours at that point, and immediately I recognize that reality or the 'external world' is really just a projection of myself. It's all a narrative, we fall into them and act them out, psyc's can pull us back out, but not really, instead we just find ourselves in a new narrative, one where we can see the usual sober stories we're invested in, but we are simply looking at it from another perspective, a new one. There isn't really an escape so to speak. To be free of it would be to NOT be it -  and you can't not be it - and expect to see it. It is, as you are. 

I have a similiar experience to a past psilocybin trip, where I see my face age until I am staring at an old man, I see myself as a kid, I can see all the blood capillaries underneath my skin, I see my heart beating, for the first time I can feel my heart in a way I never have, every heartbeat feels good. I never really thought about how tirelessly my heart works to keep me going and very rarely does it complain. It's a good heart. 

The sense of being alive feels incredible, to be alive, to breath, to feel the pull of gravity, the warmth of skin, to be able to smell, and touch, and see and hear. There is so much here we take for granted. I take for granted at least. 

I expected to it to be an emotional experience considering my circumstances, and it was, just not in the way I had thought. 

As I'm looking at myself I have this stupid fucking smile on my face, it's just pure joy and it's amazing to look at. To see joy expressed through this little hairless rodent creature that is tripping balls. It takes a minute to hit me the grinning rat monkey is me, and I burst into the best laughter I've ever had. 

'I'm this?!, Why in the fuck is everyone so damn serious about everything all the time. Look at us, we're naked mole rats with nukes. Sometimes you just need to go with it. No judgements, it is what it is, dance in it. Play with it.' 

I hear a voice saying 'That's it! You keep forgetting to play in it, play in it, all of it. That's the whole fucking point.'

At this moment the trip takes on a darker tone, I see porcelain bones and rotting flesh whenever I close my eyes, botched surgeries, dead bodies, all my visuals take on a mustard yellow and black coloration. 

And then I ask out loud 'Everything that consciousness has to offer and you give me human-centric blood and guts and bodies. I will dance in the gore if I have to but is this really what you want?'

Something about my mindset to it, my openness to play, regardless of the subject matter seemed to shift something and I was back to laughing and grinning like the happiest monkey I've ever seen. 

I have never seen that pure emotion of joy on my face before, really looked at it you know? It such a thing of beauty, it's just feels great to see joy expressed so freely. I look good when I smile, yet I walk around with a permanent neutral expression plastered on my face. No more. 

I tried to sit down at my computer to write but the screen was uninteresting compared to the colors of the sky, the hues of green on the tree's outside. 'Why would I stare at a screen when there is this' as I pointed out the window. 

I thought about my Dad for a while. I am going to miss that guy, he's honestly one of the most selfless people I've ever met, he's fundamentally a good thing, the world would have been that little darker without him it in. But I also know that nothing stays the same, everything comes to pass, the good, the bad, the neutral. Everything is in constant motion, only the witness remains. 

I gave my Dad mushrooms yesterday. A lot more than I took today. He had asked to try them, something he'd always wanted to do and just never got around to it. He spent most of the trip lying in bed, he cried at one point and laughed at others but he seemed pretty unaffected by it. A lot less than I was today.

When he had gotten out of bed I asked him about the experience and he just shrugged and said he didn't feel much. I had hoped (selfish I know) that the experience would open him up a little, he's never been very open with anyone. When he got emotional during the trip he would repeat 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry' and I would reassure him that it was OK to be vulnerable, if anyone had earned the right to be, it was him in that moment. 

As i said I gave him 5g of dried shrooms, I took 2g. If I had taken 5g I would have been gone 100%. Partly the reason I took them today was because I was genuinely curious if they had been kept around for too long and lost potency. 

But I realized that, life, this narrative, it's going to go the way it goes, I honestly don't have any control over it. I do have one choice though. To dance or not to dance and mother fucker I am going to dance until my legs fall off. 

When everyone is complaining and down, I am going to beam my goofy grin as far as my lips can stretch, offer my hand and ask everyone to join me. They either do or they don't.",45,5914,9,1153,1
2014-10-21 14:43:42,I've been microdosing LSD and mushrooms every two days for a period lasting 4 months. Here is what I've learned from using it in various situations.,"I have 3 friends who have done the same over periods lasting from 0.5-3 months. 2 of them with LSD and 1 with mushrooms. I am taking their observations and experiences into account as well.

In the beginning, i swallowed 0.3g golden teacher mushrooms every Mon, Wed, Friday morning, before attending studies (Multimedia design), while my friend chewed on a 25ug (1/9 of a 220ug) Lord Shiva LSD tab before going to work as a phone salesman 3 days a week. We continued this way for 1 month.

On the bus, on my way to school, i often caught myself smiling for no apparent reason. When i looked out the window i saw some sort of beauty in everything, like the motion the wind created on things like leaves, peoples hair, and it was sort of fun to observe how tired other people on the bus were looking every morning.

In class and during lectures, i became significantly more active. I had an increased focus on what was presently happening, which made it easier for me to listen to what my teacher was saying.

My creativity seemed to increase, when working on small assignments like making moodboards (a mixture of pictures coherent with a given subject), designing Logo's, etc.

I also had a buzzing amount of extra energy that mostly lasted between 6-8 hours, depending on when i started relaxing. It felt comparable to coffee in some way, except for the very comfortable body high which coffee never had given me.

The energetic effects also made me more social. Suddenly i spoke with people from my class that i had barely exchanged any words with before, and i became more of a ""yes-man"" in general, when asked to come and play football, to go have a beer or two at the school bar, etc.

It also made me able to remember things faster and more vividly, which in turn increased my ability to talk while at the same time thinking about what to say. It helped me speak about things connected to my memory in a more fluent way, and to describe my thoughts better.

At the end of a day of microdosing, when looking back, it was a good day overall.

When discussing with my friend, it seemed that he had experienced pretty much the same effects on LSD as i had on shrooms, except for the body high, which he felt was more intense, almost to the point where it could be uncomfortable, and the effects lasted 10-14 hours (my shrooms lasted 6-8). Furthermore, he told me he had increased his sales at work with around 15-20%, which he considered a result of LSD microdosing.

During the 2nd month, i began taking LSD microdoses 3 days from Mon-Friday, and 1-2 days every weekend. I chose to take 18ug (1/12 of a 220ug LSD tab), since my friend was larger built than me. Instead of using it for studies only, i started taking it before Thai Boxing practice, Football and partying.

The effects were much the same as with shrooms, except for the duration which was longer, and the body high which felt less ""grounded"" somehow, and more intense in an energetic way.

For Thai Boxing, the effects were amazing. I felt increased balance, strength, stamina and focus while training kicks and practicing combo's. My mind and body simply felt more connected, which resulted in better use of my physical resources. Only negative could be that i sometimes focused my attention towards optimal body usage so much, that i occasionally missed out on my trainers instructions.

Playing football was interesting. When i had the ball, i felt more confident than usual. My senses helped me know when a teamplayer was becoming available for a pass, while also making me aware of incoming enemy players. Sadly, my mind could sometimes wander off a bit when i didnt have the ball. Ideas of possible gameplays flew through my mind, and thoughts of what i would do with the ball once i got it again, often resulted in less focus regarding my optimal positioning on the field.

Drinking alcohol while on LSD microdoses was weird. It somehow made me less drunk than usual, and more observant of the foolishness alcohol brings to a group atmosphere. Drinking made me dizzy-drunk, but not stupid-drunk, and that made me a bit excluded from the party-culture i was surrounded by in those situations. After having done this 3-4 times, i stopped combining the two completely. Either i was going out on alcohol for partying, or micro's if i was attending rave parties.

Meanwhile my friend kept going with microdoses at work. Some days were worse than others for him. He had a tendency to think ""if i feel this great by taking this amount, i would probably feel even better if i took even more"". This made him have some pretty crazy days at work on 50ug (2x dose), where he had lots of fun and became extremely talkative, but had difficulties focusing on work.

One time during these 2 months, he tried 75ug (3x dose) and had to leave work early, since he suddenly was unable to have a conversation with anybody at all. Considering that a full dose of LSD usually lies around 110-220ug, i dont wonder why he felt uneasy at work. I had warned him about taking too many microdoses at once, since i had read about the consequences of it somewhere on erowid. The state of mind was called ""Limbo"" - a state where you arent really tripping, but you arent really capable of handling your daily routines either.

Some of my other friends started microdosing too. One did shrooms, the other did LSD.

The shroom friend used it for school and fitness purposes, and felt it was useful for both. Sometimes he used it 4-5 days in a row, which made the effects vary a bit. Some days he didnt even know if he was affected, but in his mind the placebo effect was good too.

The LSD friend used it for school and work purposes, and like the shroom friend he did it 4-5 days in a row. I've been told by himself and a class mate of his later on, that he apparently answered a tough math question, regarding exponential functions, out loud within 4-5 seconds, head-calculated, which impressed the whole class because many of them hadnt even finished typing it on their calculators, and he wasnt known for being that good at math. Hard to verify this though, but i found it worth mentioning. After 3 weeks, on a friday, a fifth day in a row being affected by lsd micro's, he got involved in a car crash, and partly blamed his heavy use of micro's, which he said had made him uncontrollably tired. Everybody involved in the crash were luckily unharmed. It was a dangerous condition to drive in though, and after this event he stopped the experiment.

In the 4th month, i was still going strong on LSD micro's. My friend that i started with, took a break since the summer was starting and he no longer felt the need for energy boost and anti-depressants. My shroom friend continued, but with 2 day intervals between ingestion (used to take it 4-5 days in a row like LSD friend). He felt that the effects were more stable this way.

For me, this month was exam month. I had 2 exam presentations to do.

Both exams went very well. Before going in there, i could barely wait to get in that room and show them what i had. Normally i was a bit nervous, but not as nervous as the average student. But this time i was incredibly confident, clearminded and spoke clearly. I had a sort of ""tunnel vision"" focus on what to do, and my teachers could see that. I felt invincible, but later i realized that feeling could bite me in the ass. It made me less aware of potential mistakes i could make/have made. But nonetheless, i felt crazy good.

Today i've begun microdosing again, after having a long summer break. Still feels awesome. Good to be back! And for anybody who wish to try it out - I can strongly recommend it!

To sum it up, i'd say you get;

- Improved mood (Random smiling, more social)

- More energy (Both physically and enthusiastically. Better than coffee!)

- Increased focus (Tunnel vision is great, except for when youre on a football field and dont have the ball)

- Better balance (For martial arts you feel more intuitive. Senses improved)

- More clearminded (Easier to translate thoughts into words. More vivid memory)

- Vivid dreams (Not lucid. Just more vivid)

.. James Fadiman was on to something when he studied microdoses, but when it comes to psychedelics, microdoses are still the most understudied aspect of all. Hopefully that will change soon.",148,8311,26,1488,1

2020-07-21 02:53:31,"Future wife appeared to me on Shrooms and told me how to ""Woo"" her on our first date.","I am a very experienced tripper and I take a ""Heroic"" level dose, just about every Friday night for learning purposes and have been doing that for a while. I thought I'd seen it all....

Well, 2 days before a blind date with a girl we'll just call ""Joy"", I was doing my regular Friday exploration. I had so far only had a handful of text communications with her. We hadn't even talked on the phone or anything. Literally zero to no specific data on this girl. 

Well of all people, she shows up quite vividly in my trip unexpectedly and proceeds to tell me a ton of shit.  I perceive we've known each other for lifetimes. I learn she is to be a major part of my life, help me with a big dream I have, become my wife and even learn she will be the one I die with. Wtf!?!? Both during and after the trip my mind couldn't even comprehend that this could be real.

During the trip, Joy tells me her favorite flowers are purple tulips, she tells me to bring them to her on our first date. She tells me other details about ""herself"" and how to treat her and how to woo her. 

Well folks, that was 4 weeks ago now. We are officially BF and GF. Purple Tulips turned out to be her favorite flowers. All of the other details were 100% on point. She's now listenned to the audio recordings I made during the trip, where I was just saying out loud what I was hearing her say. It blew her mind. At first she thought I changed the timestamps on the audio recordings because they were so specific about her and couldn't have been made before we had even met. 

So we are of course taking things in stride and not going to move too fast. I feel like a person should date someone for a long time before making such a major commitment. But God damn we are already in love and things just have been instantly intimate. I already see her as my wife and she sees me as her husband. 

This is such a crazy thing to happen. My mind is still blown as our relationship keeps unfolding and we're seeing more long-term viability as each day progresses.

2020-06-08 10:24:37,Awareness Campaign for Petition e-2534 - Decriminalize Psychedelics in Canada,"I am making this post to raise awareness for **Petition e-2534**, which calls for the decriminalization of Psychedelics in Canada. This petition has a scheduled hearing in the Canadian House of Commons later this year where it will be presented by Green Party MP, Paul Manly. From reports that I have read online, this petition will require upwards of **500,000 signatures** by **August 14th** for it to be something that is taken seriously by our Canadian officials. This is something that is achievable if we use the combined efforts of our reddit/subreddit communities, and personal social media to raise awareness for this petition and psychedelic medicine in general.

There are a number of studies that show promising medicinal benefits of psychedelics for various mental illnesses, alzheimers, and as addiction treatment. When combined with cognitive behavioural therapy, it has been shown that a psychedelic trip under the guidance of a therapist can sometimes equate to 10 years of standard therapy. For alzheimers, studies have shown that microdosing in late middle age can lower the risk of dementia by more than half; and has been shown to be an effective treatment for mitigating the effects of those already suffering dementia. In terms of addictions, psychedelics have shown to be an effective treatment for opioid addictions and may one day replace opioids for the purposes of general anesthetic altogether.

This being said, under the current system most research revolving around psychedelics are either under funded or blocked by bureaucratic red tape. Through decriminalization, we take a step forward towards destigmatizing psychedelics, and allowing research to be more readily conducted, therefore advancing the potential of modern medicine and treatment.

So here is what you can do to help.

For **Canadians,** please sign the petition if this is something that you support. Here is the link:[ https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-2534](https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-2534). If you choose to sign it, please be sure to share it with your family, friends and loved ones. The more support we can get the better. If you can make a post about it on social media, please do so. We have until August to make decriminalization a reality.

For **Non-Canadians**, you can help by raising awareness for the healing potential of psychedelics within your own communities and social circles. If we can start a conversation about smart, responsible drug use for the purposes of health and medicine, we will start to walk in the direction of making psychedelics more socially accepted. You can also start your own efforts, lobbying your own local governments and communities to create a petition similar to the one that is currently in Canada. Decriminalization shouldn‚Äôt just be a Canadian phenomenon, nor should speech about responsible psychedelic use.

To close, please support this petition however you can. As once we get the ball rolling on this, we can get the world talking about Canada‚Äôs new policies, legitimizing our claim to ground breaking medicinal treatments around the globe. Ultimately, none of this inherently means that psychedelics will be made available recreationally, however it might open the doors for real positive change in medicine and health care.

I will be working with some people to continue this awareness campaign on Facebook and Instagram @ rationalpsychedelics. If you‚Äôre interested in helping us out or learning more, this is where we can be reached.",77,3557,10,548,1
2019-02-03 14:46:42,My boyfriend told me he loves me for the first time while I was on shrooms,"I just wanted to share this because it was a beautiful trip experience. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for nine months and we decided to take shrooms for the first time together. I made tea and drank my half, but he got cold feet and stayed relatively sober. 

We live in Atlanta and it was a beautiful day, 65 degrees and sunny, and lots of people were outside hanging out because of the super bowl. 

I was having a great trip. We were taking a walk and I was touching all the moss, looking at the clouds, waving at a group of little girls having a birthday party. I was just thinking about how beautiful life is. 

My boyfriend and I are very close but I know he has a hard time saying ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù so I was waiting for him to do it on his own terms. I could tell he was trying to tell me something. He would say ‚ÄúI....‚Äù and then clam up and point out something else pretty for me to look at.

We finally came up on the little downtown area, which was bustling with happy people, more than I had ever seen down there. The shops looked so neon and the people looked so joyful, and we stopped to wait for the crosswalk. My boyfriend turned to me with a sudden confidence and said ‚Äúwhat I was trying to say was...I love you so much.‚Äù And he was beaming and the sun was shining down, and tears started rolling down his face. He choked out ‚Äúyou‚Äôre like an angel‚Äù and I felt like I was experiencing the true meaning of life. It was just pure love and bursting colors and warmth, and then we crossed the street with our joyful tears and sat in our favorite pub and drank cider until I came down. 

Sorry for being so cheesy, but definitely a trip I will never forget. 

Edit: Wow, thank you to everyone who commented! I wanted to wait until I had time to go through every comment and say that you guys really warmed my heart. I didn‚Äôt expect to touch so many people with my post, but I‚Äôm very glad I did. 

During the trip, I was thinking about how it‚Äôs important to ignore everything bad that‚Äôs happening in the world every once in a while and focus on human joy and beauty, and I‚Äôm glad that I could provide that for some people with my story. I wish all of you the best, and feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to. ",74,2239,16,438,1

At a park mid afternoon, tripping balls on portobellos with gf and her freind. 

the trees were saying hi to me, one tree instructed me to come closer and I could feel it‚Äôs energy pull me towards him. 

When I put my hand on its leaves it begged me to pick up the cigarette buds left in its soil, he(yes he was a male tree) told me that when it rains the chemicals from the cigarettes soak into his body and makes him sick.

When I looked down at the ground there were what seemed like 200 cigarette buds in the soil. It made me sick, they looked like rotten worms that were feeding from the trees energy. 

I turn to the left and there‚Äôs a guy with a cheesy dad shirt that reads ‚Äúsomething-Asshole‚Äù, the guy throws his cigarette to the ground, stomps on it and walks away. (I‚Äôm blown away by the coincidence) 

Tree says to me ‚Äúyou see what I mean?‚Äù 

I then start to feel the presence of some other figure in the background, like an elderly man was watching me simultaneously playing a native flute? 

I fell to the floor picking up every cigarette bud while my girlfriend tells me to stop because people were looking at me (they weren‚Äôt). The tree gave me a blessing and I hugged it for what seemed like an hour.",72,1216,15,231,1
2022-07-19 00:57:51,We lost a Psychonaut today,"Dear fellow Psychonauts,

A few of you may remember me from a few months back asking for help for my dear friend. Yesterday, he lost his bout with psychosis after living detached from his reality for a whole year. There are a lot of brave souls on here. DON'T BE STUPID.

He overdosed on 10g of Mushrooms (Edit: the word overdose explains a dosage beyond his capability to handle), Psilocybin, about a year ago and couldn't recover mentally from the detachment of reality he felt. In his words, he felt like ""a vampire in a glass coffin and couldn't experience the world.""  He had a seizure during the end of what he remembered in his trip (EDIT: I took out the words ""heroic dose"" because there was nothing actually ""heroic"" about it. It was too much for his capabilities.) He was looking for answers, much like the users here look for. He was looking for a reason to live and something beyond himself. He was VERY smart too and the psychosis affects more intellectual people because you can't bull shit them into being happy. The journey out of a bad trip is much worse when you carry a lot of intellect and the weight of the world.

Be safe. Be educated. Be mindful. Be purposeful. These substances can be beautiful, such great teachers, and medicine. They can also be very dangerous and harmful if used incorrectly. From the bottom of my heart everyone, stay safe. If you're looking for answers, journey to the center of your soul and love yourself. You are your own hero. No one is coming to save you except you. No one else can be healthy for you. No one else can work out for you. No one else can get you over your own fears. Be the best human you can possibly be and take on the challenges this world bombards us with.

Please set an intention, say a prayer, harbor a thought, for the kind soul that was Rich. May he find the answers he was looking for on his journey.

Peace and love to all,

CaptnBarbosa

P.S. I'm here to talk as a random stranger if anyone ever needs help or answers.

EDIT: A moderator asked me to include some details for clarity and health sake. I will oblige while still respecting the family. The seizure that he mentioned, it happened towards the end of WHAT HE REMEMBERS of the bad trip. The seizure was so bad, he relieved himself when it happened and that caused more complications during the trip.

As for the bout with psychosis. Without actually saying it, please read in-between the lines. He was in a state of declining psychosis for a year. In the few times he had the energy to talk to me, his grip on reality kept declining.  He mentioned not being able to be in his own body or reality. His lack of will to live ultimately is what took his life. I don't have any morbid details because I do not know them. I can only share the sentiment to BE SAFE AND CAREFUL.",26,2807,5,520,1

2020-05-25 13:08:55,I finally did DMT and it was a bit fed up with me,"I tried many things from lsd, shrooms to saliva and back, my first lsd trip cured me from a long depressive episode and teached me to dream again. But after a few more trips it kinda became the only thing giving me purpose in life. Tripping was beautiful, loving and fun all those things I was lacking before. And it definitely helped me enoy ""sober"" life more.

During the trips I always knew that the only way to reach my dreams is hard work, dedication and simple putting the hours in. Despite all tripping I felt like there was something missing and so I spiralled from trip to trip from knowing everything and forgetting it immediately after. 

I was always looking forward to the next trip and soon it started to become ""boring"" not because I wasn't having crazy experiences any more but simply because I got so used to it. 

From copious hours of Mckenna lectures I of course got interested in DMT. I ordered some but was too excited to try it for a while. Still the knowledge that I had it wouldnt leave me allone so I decided to just do it and see what it was about.

I prepared myself for a few days and then sat down on the floor lit up the pipe and of I went. 

I cant remember if there was a voice or if it was the general feeling i was having but it felt like it was telling me ""Ah its you again... Still not happy? still searching for something? How often do you need to hear this?"" There were thousands of the most beautiful images flashing before my eyes but I was to anxious to really look at them like I didn't deserve it. What followed was basically a dialogue with the DMT, my subconsciousness or whatever you might call it about my life and how I have everything I could hope for and endless opportunitys to learn play and create, but wasn't doing any of it. 

I have a pc to learn animation which I always wanted, a guitar and enough time to do all of it. I realized (again) that all I need to be happy is right in front of me but I am the one who needs to do the beeing. 

DMT kicked my ass and it was exactly what I needed, I don't think I'll go back to that place for a long time now. Not until I have achieved something that I can be proud of and know how to enjoy life completely sober. I do think/believe that the dmt realm is where we all come from and where everything is going to go at some point.

Psychedelics are absolutely amazing but not if you overdo it, I still have much to learn here and for now I'll see how trippy sober life gets.

I hope this made sense and thanks for reading.

2022-04-13 03:39:59,I took drugs in my youth like it was a competition. But a lot of the posts here have even me concerned for the health of many of you,"I took heroic, absolutely heroic doses of lsd, mushrooms, brown acid, among many others. And I broke.

I broke in so many ways it is hard to give power to the words to describe it. Every conversation was a conflict. Every action had deep moral consequences. Everything was terror and horror for years.

I found a way out sure. But I live a bizarre razors edge existence, trying to balance between the normal world and an existence through the looking glass. I live in the country, have tremendous difficulty with large groups of people, and prefer to socialize with a very small group of people. 

Just because you can influence to the flow of the universe doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt get anxiety/flashbacks/motor control issues/memory loss.

I have lost so many memories that I‚Äôve stopped keeping pictures. There is no point to them anymore.

I am not here to make anyone feel like they shouldn‚Äôt control the substances they ingest. I would be a hypocrite to do so. But there seems to be a large volume of posts about users not controlling the substances they ingest‚Ä¶

2019-11-28 12:15:12,Do you ever see this sub posts and think: this guy has major issues,"I often come here and find myself reading someone's journey or experiences, which tend to be stories of psychedelic wins or revelations, but what I notice is a lot of these posts touch on the fact they have mental health issues, readily use and regularly consume other drugs or cocktails to trip like it is totally normal. I'd just like to check that other people see this when they read it and would tend to think along the lines of ""oh this person is pretty lost"" MORE than thinking ""wow this person is experienced"" 

I see people rattle off things non chalant like "" yeah so I've been fighting my schizophrenic tendencies and social anxieties lately through a journey of self discovery and experimentation of being by accessing other planes of my consciousness. I took 5g shrooms in the evening and smoked a bowl to let it settle, I decided this time to skip my anxiety meds since last week I felt it interfered with my self awareness during my lsd and Molly trip last week. Well guys what a ride this was, I was broken and loved and blah and blah. I can feel the healing battle against the darkness in me and I want to express my eternal love for everything and oneness blah blah... 

These posts and similar are concerning, and I am increasingly wondering if we are encouraging this with our comments and engagenent in posts. We are contributing the the enabling of these delusional behaviours where people seek healing in themselves by external and altering substances that lets be honest, we don't know enough about. 

If you have major mental illness, issues etc perhaps drugs are not going to be your answer to these struggles. People are entirely free to pursue what they like but I am beginning to feel a uneasy with some posts and the blind support given. It's almost like enabling a circlejerk of delusion.


EDIT: I'd like to thank you all for your participation, perspectives, discussions, debates, challenging me to think differently, enlightening me to my own flaws in effective communication (as many took the post entirely diff than intended). It has been totally fascinating to get the insight from users

I also hope that those whom seemingly reacted impulsively by replying with anger, hate, disgust, abuse and any level of emotional Valence beyond simply disagreeing with the view respectfully, can take a step back to look at themselves and honestly ask why, and I don't mean 'cuz who r u to judge' instant dismissals, where you position it as reacting to ME, I mean ask why YOU felt the way you did, REALLY, and admit IF you felt threatened by the truth of it in yourself. If it helps one person then fantastic. If it yields nothing then no problem, but it will help us all grow to challenge our beliefs and thoughts, even if only to strengthen rather than change them. 

I have learned a lot from you all. What I want from psychadelics, what I do not want and fear from them, I can see the path to enlightenments can also be walked in the other direction into chaos and blinded wreckless choices. These things are powerful, but not determined as good or bad. That is down to your perspective, actions and ability to be honest and true to yourself. 

I love psychadelics, I really would adore for a revolution in main stream thinking and approaches to their uses, I do not want anyone to fuck their entire life up by blindly abusing them. You will do what you will do, I can't control any of that, I can only control what I think say and do. So perhaps doing this edit now is my attempt to show you that control is within and not external, if you're lost, looking outward might not be the best path to find you again, as tempting as that escape or distraction is at the time, that is what it is, an escape of some kind.

2023-04-12 20:41:45,I accidentally took mushrooms üçÑ today,"This morning before work, I decided to take 2 lions mane capsules before starting my day. About an hour and a half later I started to feel really sick‚Ä¶ I thought it was all the caffeine I had on an empty stomach. I looked in the mirror and thought, ‚Äúman, if I didn‚Äôt know any better, I‚Äôd think I took some mushrooms.‚Äù Then I remembered the two capsules I took earlier and it hit me what I actually took.  
At first I was fighting it.. but I thought I better embrace it, maybe the üçÑhas a message for me. After I told my work I wasn‚Äôt feeling well, I immediately felt relief.  I went for a nice walk outside, the sky was blue with birds chirping, some light white clouds overhead, shaping into different things. 
I came back inside and saw so many things about the way I‚Äôm living. My house was a disaster‚Ä¶ so much clutter and random shit just there for days. I cleaned my house, watered my plants, opened the blinds to let the sunshine in‚Ä¶ all the things I had been neglecting and not even realizing. I washed my face with cool water, I ate a juicy apple, I stretched and played with my dogs. I missed my husband. I cried when thinking about my dog that passed a couple years ago. I felt things I was ignoring. 
This morning I was struggling to get up for work‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been living in my phone lately. the üçÑwoke me up today. I feel so much lighter, my eyes are open and I see things different now than I did this morning. Thank you üçÑ",37,1428,6,277,1

The old way of hording the gold of the world for your own pile of coins to grow is gone with. The concept of keeping and having many times over the amount that you need will be looked at as a form of mental disease. 

All local communities have banded together to grow the food needed for the surrounding area to flourish and prosper through all of the seasons. People without enough are given enough and the society as a whole now decides to take care of all of its members even if they provide nothing to society.

The systems of Government are filled with reliable and honest people who want the true loving evolution of Earth to happen naturally and are open to evolving ideas always.

All forms of racism are exposed as a lack of education on science and culture and no longer have a grip on the minds of the people.

Cities are designed with a true balance of human and nature, always honouring and the beauty found on Earth and the beauty found in all living creatures.

People spend their time creating art, learning, exploring, growing and relaxing. 

&#x200B;

A peaceful unification for a human purpose is accepted world wide - the true human goal - to be the caretakers of this planet.

2020-12-12 23:52:13,That one time I forgot how to count on mushrooms in a gas station and almost lost my mind...,"when i was 18 (so like 15 years ago) i was at a gas station buying cigarettes for my friends who were underage on like an eigth of shrooms. they had not told me in advance that i was responsible for buying the cigarettes. i thought i was just going for an awesome hyperspace car ride.

so i go in the store with no shoes, eyes like saucers, visibly nervous, and i walk up to the counter.

i summon all my courage and confidently tell the clerk, ""one pack of cigarettes please"" and the guys like...

""...uh... did you have a brand in mind?""

tensions rose.

so im grasping at straws for cigarette brands. finally i land on ""camel reds"" 

he looks me up and down suspiciously and cards me. everything is in order so he tells me the price, 

""thatll be 5.85"" and it was at this moment that i realize im carrying all $1 bills and...

i no longer remember how to count... so im basically fucked. im going to prison. my family's going to disown me. and im definitely going to hell.

then it hits me. 

like a lightning bolt... 

perhaps the most brilliant idea ive ever had...

it doesnt matter if i dont know how to count because the clerk does know how to count, and i can use his sober brain instead of my tripper brain to do the counting if i simply put the bills down one at a time, and watch his eyes. 

when he knows its enough, itll register on his face, and ill know when to stop putting down bills. pretty great right? i effectively outsourced pattern recognition to the clerk. einstein would have been proud.

just one problem. the clerks not looking at the counter, and hes not lookin at the money. hes looking right at me. like dead in the eyes.

so essentially i made it rain on this guys counter, making full eye contact, for like 11 bills before he puts his hand on my wrist and goes...

""dude are u ok?""

this was the closest ive ever come to having a bad trip... so stressful. it only gets worse from there, but eventually i got out of that gas station, shook, but psychologically intact... somehow... it was a close call. lol.",92,2039,19,384,1

2019-12-06 13:25:13,More from a 60s Acid Freak,"My stories are true, my memories are perfect. 

Reflecting back on my life to my first LSD period: it started when I was 19 in 1968, and lasted about four years. During this period I took as much as possible as often as possible. I didn‚Äôt plan anything. I was drawn to it like metal shavings are to a magnet. I had a contact in Berkeley that lived with a chemist and would sell me the most outrageous product. 50 hits for $50 and I would sell 25 of them for $2 each, eat the other 25, and then buy more.

It took me about two years of wandering the streets, stoned, to find my true self and way. Over these four years I had a couple hundred major trips. My breakthrough was a 1700ug trip on pure LSD-25. It was a totally insane experience where I killed myself and was reborn under an apple tree, where I learned to eat once again. 

After this trip I was allowed to trip every four days and my trips were all the same: I died and dwelled with God. I was the fool on the hill. I talked backwards, I had no friends and I live in a cave on the California coast. Many nights I would wander to the homeless campfires, smoking their dope and listening to their stories. 

My goal in life was to alter my being so I would always be stoned. Being ‚Äòstoned‚Äô to me meant seeing and understanding ‚Äòwhat is‚Äô from the psychedelic point of view. I rejected all religions and all forms of meditation. Acid and grass was my mantra. 

I finished this period by programming myself and took my girl friend (who was carrying my first son) back into the ‚Äòworld.‚Äô  I built a successful business in finance and was a pillar of success in my community. This lasted 17 years until I said ‚Äòenough‚Äô. 

I then entered my second psychedelic period. I met Terence McKenna through his writings. This was my period of the Mushroom. TK challenged me to go on his mushroom fast. You start with five grams of dried cubensis and four days later increase your dose by one gram. I maxed out at 25 grams, as by the time I ate that much I was too stoned to eat anymore. I did this for a year. 

I was in pre-trial at this time for financial crimes I committed and was ordered to be examined. I was declared permanently disabled after being examined by several shrinks. In my past career I bought a massive amount of disability insurance on myself. So now I‚Äôm once again permanently stoned but I now have nearly $15,000 per month of tax free income. This income was protected from all creditors and the feds. They later changed the law, due in part to me. 

I‚Äôm off to prison but I‚Äôm permanently stoned and certified crazy. In prison I‚Äôm seen as the crazy fool. They are pumping anti-psychotic drugs into me but they have no effect.

I‚Äôm in here for four years they say and I‚Äôm tripping weekly without using anything. They let me out at two years and the mushroom returned to me. In my last few months in prison I wrote down what I would do over the next 20 years of my life. Some of these writings were extremely detailed and all have come true. 

My third psychedelic quest is now. It began five years ago with me writing on Reddit. About three years ago I discovered research chemicals. I bought three hundred hits of 1P LSD and over 8 grams of 4-aco-dmt and some of the other RCs that were psychedelics. 

I didn‚Äôt like the 1P that much and gave away what was left of my stash to some recovering vets but love the 4-aco. 4-aco-dmt is a synthetic mushroom. My ideal dose is 70 mg, which is a HUGE dose. I‚Äôve averaged about 80 major trips a year during these past three years. I‚Äôm gearing down as my stash is almost gone and my source is gone. I‚Äôve never worried about using too much or not having enough, as these substances regulate themselves with me. 

This last psychedelic quest has been really different in that NOBODY knows what I‚Äôm doing. I have learned to hide it perfectly. One of my shrinks from long ago said ‚ÄòI was as crazy as snot but well compensated‚Äô. Well compensated meaning no one can tell. I‚Äôve perfected this. 

Am I crazy?  Fuck no, unless you define crazy as not normal. You see, nothing makes sense. I get a ton of down votes here when I revel that I know all. But fuck you guys as you have no clue. I do know all. The really funny thing is so do you. 

If I sit down with someone, and explain the truth, they smile and tell me ‚ÄòI knew that.‚Äô  We were all born with the full knowledge and secrets of creation. We haven‚Äôt forgotten, we just have set it aside.

I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm heading this time. This is the period of a quest where I lay out my future. What are my desires?  I‚Äôm over 70 years old. I have all of the material things I need. I‚Äôve been growing almost all my food for the past 20 years and have just accepted the nomination to be president of an organic farming association. I‚Äôm also a 1/4 member of a for-profit farming group. 

I raise farm animals and have learned how they talk; they talk to me with vibrations. Sometimes it‚Äôs obvious that as far as they are concerned I‚Äôm here to serve them. 

I‚Äôve also have been focused upon Creation. My lifelong questions have been answered, not verbally or in thoughts, but with visions. My own visions.

I can also remember. All of my life experiences are laying out before me, good and bad. I forgive myself for the bad ones. Forgiveness is truly divine. We are told to forgive our enemies but I have been told to take it even farther, to appreciate my enemies. 

I receive boundless joy from just observing ‚Äòwhat is‚Äô. 

Some ramblings from an old acid freak.",26,5509,6,1038,1
2018-11-30 12:23:03,I was injected with DMT in the name of science,"Following a few hours of screening and getting acquainted with the MRI, I had two full DMT study days at the Imperial College's Hammersmith Hospital in London, as a participant in some cutting edge brain imaging neuroscience research conducted by researchers at Imperial College London. This would be a study looking at the phenomenology of the DMT experience (via questionnaire surveys), brain wave states (via EEG) and brain activity (by using changes associated with blood flow as a correlate, via fMRI).  The two study days were a week apart (a slot came available earlier than originally planned, and it was a big help to the Imperial guys with my being able to be flexible). I abstained from intoxicants a week prior to the study day. I was initially invited to participate in the pilot DMT-EEG study via a friend who is paying for the MRI scanning sessions, and I had the opportunity to participate in this study due to other study participants moving about in the scanner and giving poor quality data as a result.

On the study day, on arrival at the hospital, I meet with the head neuroscientist whose study it is, another researcher working with him, and the medical doctor who will be injecting me with the DMT (high purity synthetic DMT fumarate) and placebo (saline). I wash my hair in preparation for the EEG skullcap being fitted, and then a number of electrodes are attached to a number of places over my scalp via a gel that soon solidifies as I complete a number of questionnaire surveys on a laptop. I'm wired up to the EEG and shown how sensitive it is to noisy data (essentially if the face isn't relaxed). So one needs to be relaxed and very still while undergoing the DMT experience in the MRI for high quality data to be produced. I'm fitted with an injection port in my arm to allow for easy IV injection of DMT and placebo. I have good rapport with the Imperial team and feel like I'm in good, safe hands. I've met the leading neuroscientist running the study a number of times, he's a great chap.

There are four EEG and fMRI brain scanning sessions...two with DMT (in the medium and high dosage range), two with saline placebo, and I don't know which order I'll be receiving the dosages in. It was good to have been acquainted with the MRI environment prior to any dosing. My upper body is confined to the MRI tube, and my head is secured. For the quality of both the EEG and MRI data, it is imperative I cannot and do not move. I have eye shades on while being scanned, with eyes closed. The scanner is really quite noisy, but despite the noise and the confined, restricted space, I quite quickly start to feel comfortable in there.

I was really quite nervous prior to my first dosing. Prior to my first scanning session I gave a urine sample for a drug test to make sure I was clean. I was fitted into the bed in the scanner and it was made sure I was secure. My head was locked in and I was fitted with ear plugs and ear defenders. Eye shades were placed over my eyes and I was loaded into the scanner. Anxiety levels were increasing. I communicate with the study lead through an intercom. He plays a recording of ""You are receiving the dose now"" and I select my preferred volume over the sound of the baseline scan of my brain. Following the scan, it is time for the dosing. I know that dosing is now imminent, and I'm pretty nervous and my heart is pounding. I receive my dose, and nothing happens. Going on from previous experience in the DMT-EEG pilot study, I know it would only be a few seconds before I start feeling the dose if it was DMT. I'm able to relax, knowing I will not be receiving the dose now. I think this worked quite well, as with more time spent in the MRI scanner, the more comfortable I got being in there.

I fill out a variety of questionnaire surveys and we have lunch. Another member of the Imperial team I know comes to pay me a visit with his baby. This is nice and has a soothing effect on my nerves. We head back in the scanner. A little nervous as I know I will be being dosed for sure now. I personally don't enter the DMT space lightly these days...it is not really a ""love n' light"" experience for me, but rather something much more serious and imposing in tone, if not outright menacing in tone. I'm wired up and loaded in the scanner, with a panic button on hand, and I'm talked through a body scanning session to help relax me. This time around, I will provide an intensity rating every minute. The study lead starts asking me my intensity rating (0 being no effect, 10 being the most intense drug effect imaginable), so I know dosing is imminent. I hear the dosing notification recording, and prepare for blast off. Within in a few seconds there is a distinct shift and expansion of perception behind closed eyelids...the contrast changes dramatically, a silvery screen comes into focus, and from this geometric patterns of extraordinary beauty and order condense and coalesce and link up in the space of just a few seconds. At the same time, I become aware of this feeling of heat or warm energy in both of my hands (something I experience repeatedly on mushrooms and other psychedelics and cannabis, and sometimes while deeply relaxed or meditating). This is a pleasant sensation, and for some reason it reassured me, I knew I was going to be ok, and relaxed and surrendered completely to the experience. It takes me a minute following dosing to peak interestingly. At minute 1 I'm at a 7, minute 2 I'm at an 8, by minute 3 I'm already on my way back! A very fleeting and fast moving experience. The geometric visual architecture I'm witness too is outrageously beautiful. I remember coppery, bronzey metallic colours, navy blue and some neon pink in the centre of my vision during the peak...in the centre of my vision, it was like there was a light shining into the visual realm, illuminating what I was seeing and splitting up the spectrum of colours to produce a resplendently coloured but localised pool of constantly undulating colours. As the intensity of the peak wears off and I start to come back, I feel in a serene afterglow state, and I nearly tear up in gratitude for having the opportunity to experience something so amazing. I completely relaxed into the remainder of the experience, and I realise the anxieties I'd carried were misplaced.

I should mention that IV DMT is a very smooth ROA, and I much prefer it to vaping. The transition to DMT space I found was smoother and less jarring than vaping it, and due to this smooth entry to DMT space, it seems to change the tone of the experience. I imagine at higher dosages things are likely to be more jarring, given how efficient this ROA is, and I‚Äôm not really condoning it, as I was injected with medical grade DMT by a medical doctor, it was a nice way to fly though!

Following the experience I am interviewed in detail about the content of my experience, and find I can recall a fair bit (certainly a lot more than by subsequent high dose experience). I then complete a number of questionnaire surveys to assess my experience in different ways, before having a shower to wash the EEG gel out of my scalp (remnants of which remained in there for a week), I say goodbye to the study lead and head home.

For the second study day, things were reversed, in that I got the DMT dose in the morning MRI scanning session, and the placebo for the intensity rating study. For the afternoon placebo session, even without being dosed, I was definitely in an altered, pre-hypnogogic state in the scanner. It makes me curious as to whether the very powerful magnets of the MRI could affect the brain in some way...but I see pink light pulsing in waves, and my imagination and memory recall is unusually vivid. I feel deeply relaxed in there, despite it being confined and it being so noisy, and I feel on the verge of sleep. Following this I am interviewed and complete more questionnaire surveys.

My second DMT dose for the morning scanning session was a fair bit higher, and I could tell this within a few seconds of being injected with it. There was a dramatic change in contrast, accompanied by a very powerful feeling of acceleration or expansion, as I entered the DMT space. I encounter similar very beautiful, very ordered geometric visual patterning, but this time much more expansive and all encompassing, and much fast moving. I recall this experience being one of supreme order and supreme chaos...two opposites...at the same time. This was a more imposing experience given its intensity compared to the first, lighter dose. I have to say, I rather enjoyed the MRI scanner setting! Despite being cramped and restricted in movement, despite the incredible noise, it was experienced as a positive setting for a DMT experience in my case, and really didn't detract (one of my friends who took part in this same study thought the same). The interaction of the loud and highly repetitive and rhythmic MRI scanner sounds was interesting, and had a big effect on the visual aspect of the experience...what I was hearing really seemed to cross over with what I was seeing, and at the peak it was hard to know which was which. The experience was longer than the previous one, but a fair bit harder to recall afterwards, due I think to how fast moving the experience was. I didn't encounter any entities in either experience...and I never have in any of my DMT experiences so far. On my re-entry I experienced the same feelings of gratitude, and feelings of love and empathy for the special people in my life. Despite the power and speed of the geometries I was moving through, I never forgot that I was part of a scientific study (apparently some other participants did forget this), and I remained absolutely still for the duration. I was commended for this by the researchers, who stated that I would be in the front of the queue should Imperial conduct brain imaging research with 5-MeO-DMT..

One of the final questions I was asked in the surveys was to rate to what degree I thought the experience could be explained as the effect of a drug on the brain, and to what degree I thought I was interacting and experiencing something outside or beyond myself. During the experience itself, I may have been more inclined towards the latter, but once I was back, I rated more highly on the ""drug effect on brain"" scale...while actually being in the DMT space can be so real, so vivid and so convincing at times, when I'm back down and my mind folds back in on itself to conform to this reality, my sceptical walls go back up with it. From this sober vantage point it seems more likely to me that the DMT experience is some very beautiful and mysterious aberration of brain function, an experience of one's deep inner self...not that I feel that detracts from its majesty really, given that the human brain is arguably the most mysterious, complex and amazing thing we know of in the universe.

So there you have it. An experience I feel tremendous gratitude for having had the opportunity to have, and great to see scientific research on psychedelics start to expand into interesting new areas, and great also to encounter some really great people involved in this. Not something I shall ever forget. Onwards!!! :)",46,11249,10,2016,1
2020-11-19 03:13:33,First time DMT (about 18mg) Alien hospital experience,"I took 3 good hits out of a glass pipe.
After the third hit it felt like I was instantly in an intense shroom trip and I thought ""oh shit this is it"". I handed the pipe to my friend and I closed my eyes. Throughout the experience it felt like I was always able to open my eyes if I wanted to but I decided to keep them closed to get fully immersed in the experience.

I started to hear the high pitched tone everyone else always hears but it was very faint. As I closed my eyes I saw some pretty CEV's that were getting more intense by the second. Eventually it filled my entire field of view and it started looking like an actual 3d world or room. Before this trip I had some doubts if the dosage was high enough but as I started to dip my toes into this world I thought to myself ""yeah I'm definitely not ready for anything more intense than this"".

Immediately I felt a presence that was agreeing with me and saying ""yeah this is just about right isn't it?"". It felt very friendly. Suddenly I vaguely saw about 6 figures standing around me. I felt like I was laying flat on my back even though my real body was sitting upright on my bed. It was like I was on an operating table. I saw what looked like the entities touching me like they were checking or repairing something. They felt incredibly friendly.

As the DMT started to wear off they were telling me ""Don't worry. You're going to be just fine"". It felt like they were making sure I got back to my reality. The last thing I saw was what looked like an x-ray of my own body and It looked like something bad got removed from it. As I opened my eyes I felt incredibly relieved, energetic and at peace.

This is definitely the most interesting substance I have ever tried. It's amazing what our brains are capable of.

2020-10-27 15:42:21,I figured out the reason for that feeling that we live in a simulation,"Everyone to some extent is acting out their personality, but we're not great actors. When people get tired of acting and start to slip out of character, you really notice the performance and it starts to feel like a simulation.  People tripping are more likely to slip out of character.  Abruptly stopping the performance makes the simulation more clear.

You're alone in a park. You observe the things in the park.  You see trees, grass, clouds.  You experience all these things as objects and yourself as the subject experiencing them.  Then someone else enters the park.  You become aware of them being aware of you.  You see them experiencing you as an object like you experienced the tree as an object.  You become aware of yourself as an object of someone else's experience.

Now you're in a city.  People are everywhere.  You are now constantly aware of yourself as an object of other people's experience.  You are more object than subject, always aware of how you present yourself to other people.  That awareness makes performance necessary.  You become an actor.

But you're a tired and lazy actor. And so is everyone else. Exhausted, barely keeping up the performance, but still dancing. The acting gets worse with each exhausting performance. People slip out of character.  Then you really start to notice the stage and the lights. The performance starts to feel like a simulation you are trapped in.",70,1412,14,237,1
2021-05-30 18:07:26,"Alcohol is the best evidence that society can function, even with a drug potentially very harmful, if it's not negatively stigmatized","Recently a question popped into my head; what would happen if we decriminalize/legalize every substance used to alter someones body-/brainfunction? That may be a question a lot of us already asked ourselfes. Eventhough I did not came to any conclusion, I stumbled across the fact, that we already have the perfect example of how it could go.

With alcohol as a mind altering drug, we can see how society deals with a substance that alters our thinking and perception. Alcohol is widely used among mostly every part of the population and is tolareted by almost everybody. Despite the fact that alcohol is potentially harmful, in some cases lethal drug, people who are using this substance aren't excluded from society, even sometimes better included. And it's not just the fact, that most of us do not really care if someones drinks or not. The economy and society are flourishing (subjective) eventhough there are plenty of people abusing a mind altering drug. So I am asking myself, **if we could destigmatize every substance use, would it go the same way?** *(considering a broad legalization process)*

I am very curious to hear your opinion/thoughts on that ;)",133,1164,21,194,1

With cannabis becoming decriminalized in 2018, all the recent psychedelic research proving the healing potentials of psychedelic drugs and the relaxing of laws relating to them, seasoned psychonaut‚Äôs like myself continue to come out of the psychedelic closet correcting the stigma about psychedelics that kept us oppressed for the last 50 years.

The catalyst for psychedelics going mainstream is to raise awareness about the healing potential of all plants including psychoactive medicines and psychedelic-assisted therapy. Research into psychedelic drugs came to a halt in the 1970s due to the U.S.

2020-06-15 14:13:59,10g Albino Penis Envy Bad Trip Report. Not the trip i wanted but the trip I needed,"So let me start this off with a little background.

 Back in December tried shrooms for the first time since highschool. Me and my SO instantly fell in love with them and had the best time of our lives. Dealer was really flakey so decided to research into growing them and found out was not hard at all. By March had my first 2 grows harvested. Had little over 200g of Golden teachers and 200g of Albino Penis Envy. From there you can imagine we started tripping all the time. Pretty much every 2 weeks we were taking APE. Was great at first but in the last month or 2 out trips started to get darker and darker like it was culminating to a point that I finally hit this past Friday. 

So everything starts off okay. I get off of work and get home. We set our apartment up for out upcoming later in the night. Also grabbed a few boxes of whippits out of our stash for the night. We are trying to decide on how much to take. We were gonna split 8g but end up on 10g tea of APE. So thats 5g each. Which is a herioc dose for regular mushies but PE are quite a bit stronger than anything I have ever tried before. I would say about 1.5 times stronger than my golden teachers.  

We make the tea at 8pm. And we decide to drink half then the other half a hour or 2 later so we don't get overwhelmed. We decide to watch a Disney movie called Inside Out for the come up. Everything is gravey we are having a great time. After the movie we put on some YouTube visuals on mute and put on our own tunes. Still having great time. Our trip is starting to wind down a bit so we take the second half of our cups. Thats when things started to get a bit dark.

We turn off the visuals and throw on some anime because we were getting a bit overwhelmed. I started to feel the most congested and mucusy that I have ever in my whole life. Then I start getting really bad chest pains on and extreme pressure behind my left eyeball. Kept going to the bathroom to check my eye because felt like it was blown out/bleeding. Cannot feel the left side of my face at this point and think I'm having a stroke. Everytime I stand up i feel like I am going to pass out. I keep it all together as to not freak out my GF but she knew something was up because I was just quietly sitting there not talking. She goes to the bathroom and thats when things get worse. 

I hear yelling from the bathroom that she needs help. I go in there and she is throwing up into the toilet. Making beastial like noises and looks at me and says she can't breath and is dying. I have never seen her so pale and sweaty. Im trying to convince her that its just a bad trip and it will pass but she is convinced she is going to die. I'm over here trying to calm her down as I am going in and out of reality. My depth perception is off and still no feeling on the left side of my face and chest pains. Also feel like i have gravel in my eyes.

I finally get her back to the couch were she is convinced that she is going to die, that she wants to claw her eyes out because she sees too much and that her jaw is dislocated. She is asking me to call 911. Now this is something I defiantly do not want to do. With all my jars of mushrooms, multiple new jars colonizing, 1 tub growing, and pressure cooker out and very easy to find. If I called and they found everything would surely be getting jail time and multiple felonies.  So I am contemplating where I can hid everything. I stand up to try to start stashing stuff but have to sit my ass back down immediately as I almost pass out again. Multiple points almost call 911 and think its worth going to jail to save my Gf.

 So we laid there a couple hours on the couch crying in each other's arms. We believe this is our new reality and that we broke our minds. We were afraid to fall asleep and never wake up again. I am promising her that it will pass. Trying to stay strong for her as I myself feel like I am dying as well. She just kept repeating over and over again that she doesn't want to do this anymore. We have not been taking care of ourselves as of late. Lots of partying. Tripping whenever we can. Doing cocaine almost every weekend. Being very distant from both our families. Havent had checkup in over 8yrs even tho my family has history of diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. We came to many realization during the bad trip. 

Finally at about 3am we are pretty much at baseline. One of the scariest things after the trip was going to the kitchen and realizing I had left the stove burner on for 6hrs smh. We are still in shock of the trip we just had. We had a good long talk about what we want out of life and the changes we need to make. At this point we are crying tears because we needed this wake up call and are excited for the lifestyle changes we will be making. 

Very next day we take our 2 dogs on very long walk for 2hrs. We then clean out both our cars(6full garbage bags combined from the cars) and our apartment. We called both of our families that we have plans to see them this week. Threw out the cocaine and Molly that we had in our apartment and dumped out all the alcohol. We got groceries on Sunday and instead of the trash we usually eat we got lots of healthy food and veggies. Also set up the long overdue doctors appointment for next week to check on my health. Finally ordered a engagment ring as well. Been putting it off for way to long for such a amazing girl. Going hiking this Friday for the first time in many years. 

If you've read this far thanks for listening to my report. Won't be tripping for a very long time after this. Maybe one day I'll be able to trip again and I do not blame the mushrooms at all. Right now I just appreciate how beautiful it is to be alive  Wasnt exactly the trip I wanted but was the trip I needed. Very excited for what life has in store for us and all the lifestyle changes we will be making.",82,5881,17,1162,1

2021-01-03 07:31:21,What acid taught me about thought loops,"When I'm on acid, the thoughts that arise are 1000x louder and come at me faster. And because they're so amplified, I'm more aware of how my mind latches onto them. If I follow a negative thought, I'll be in that thought loop for a while until I realise 'oh I'm in a loop now'. Then I can step out of it by choosing to follow another thought (usually helps if I change settings i.e. going to a different room, talking to someone else).

I realised that this process is happening everyday. Thoughts just *appear* in consciousness and our mind is the one constantly choosing thoughts to grasp onto and identify with, unless we're in a flow state or meditating. But this 'choosing' is less obvious when we're sober because the thoughts are quieter (or we're not listening) so we're not aware that we're getting caught by any particular thought.  A small budding negative thought (like anxiety about the future or the past) may enter our consciousness, we'll unknowingly follow it, dwell on it, feed it until it grows to the point where it's shouting at us and brought to our immediate attention. And because the thought is so loud by then, we think 'this must be important!' and continue to indulge in it, and before we know it we're consumed by the anxiety/sadness/darkness. But we can always realise again 'this is a thought loop!'.

2020-04-29 10:14:44,How meeting someone suicidal on my acid trip probably changed my life.,"**Thanks for all of the positive comments (and awards!!!), I will try to reply to every single one of them, this is such a great community of people**

Hello /r/psychonaut!

Today I'll tell you about my last acid trip that I had about five months ago now which has had a profound impact on my life. It was november and I had been saving one tab of acid for a while. I had tripped one time before this but it was not the same experience at all, my first time I just listened to music non stop for eight hours and thought about how much I loved everyone, basically a perfect introduction to acid. Nothing interesting happened outside of that. 

Fast forward to the day I'm planning to trip for my second time about five months ago, I take the tab at around 9am, it's nice and sunny outside and I'm in a good mood. About 45 minutes later I start having trouble playing minecraft and start seeing patterns in my courtains. I know it's time to trip! I'm laying in my bed just looking at my wall when all of a sudden I start feeling anxious. I didn't know what to do about it and was afraid of a bad trip, which is not a risk at all btw, it wasn't the acid making me feel anxious, it was my fear of a bad trip making me feel bad if that makes sense. Anyway I open up discord and message the tripsitters on the r/drugs discord server that I need some help and within one minute I'm in a voice call with a guy who's helping me.

Ten minutes later I'm completely fine and am just talking to this guy about what he does for work and stuff, we continue talking for about 20 minutes until suddenly a man joins the call. His breaths are short, fast and the first thing he says is that he's gonna kill himself. When you're reading this you can't possibly think that this wouldn't result in me, a guy tripping, freaking out and leaving the call or something. Weirdly enough the complete opposite happened, it was like I was in ""help this person   
right now mode"" and my only goal was just to help him. Me and the trip sitter manage to calm him down after some time and we start talking. I honestly don't know for how long we talked but it felt like hours. 

During that time he told me that he had schizophrenia and that the only way for him to cope was to get blackout drunk or get fucked up on drugs to the point where he's not himself anymore. He told me about all the relationships that he had ruined, about having to drop out of university because he couldn't come to class if he wasn't drunk. He apparently also still lived with his mom because at one point she tried to come in to his room and give him some water but he just told her to fuck off. She was ""planning something"" he explained. He then told me about his psychologist he had been seeing about once a week for a few years. The psychologist was also planning something, either to kill him or hurt him in some way. I change the subject to something more light hearted to prevent him from spiraling downwards. We keep on talking about random shit.

He then shows me his music that he made and told me that he made it in order to express his pain. I can only describe it as a mixture of Scarlxrd and Suicideboys. Really brutal/dark stuff.

At this point it's been a few hours and he had to go do something else he said, we say goodbye and I leave the call. 

About an hour goes by and I don't think much about this guy at all, I'm (still tripping) listening to the Joe Rogan podcast ft. Paul Stamets when I suddenly feel the urge to listen to some music. I listen to a few songs and then land on ""Circles"" by Post Malone. This is when I start thinking about what just happened. How an innocent guys life gets completely destroyed by something outside of his control. We have one shot at life and his just gets completely fucked by mental illness. I think about his mom who I can only assume loves him a lot, why would she not kick a drunk schizophrenic in his mid 20s who just plays video games all day out of the house if she doesn't love him? Their relationship is ruined thanks to mental illness. It doesn't matter how much love she shows, how much she is willing to do for him... at the end of the day he's still unable to work, study have friend or family or be sober without wanting to die. At this point I put the song on repeat and am sobbing uncontrollably. I cried because I realized how much pain there was in the world. It felt like my mission in life was to help people with mental illness. 

I still tear up listening to that song to this day. I don't listen to it often but it's still very important to me. I don't talk to the guy anymore because it's very difficult to have a relationship with someone like that, he's been angry with me a few times because he thinks I'm trying to trick him by saying nice things. I see him change his profile pic on discord every few weeks so he's still alive at least.

About a week after the trip I call my grandma, a retired psychiatrist, and told her about what had happened (not that I was tripping just my conversation) and that I wanted to become a psyhiatrist aswell. She invited me for some tea and said that she wanted to show me all the letters of gratitude she had saved through all her years of practicing who were from people whom she had helped. A few days later I'm in her appartment tearing up reading all of the nice words and thank yous from people who were suffering but were able to live a good life thanks to my grandma.

From that point I was certain that I wanted to become a doctor. 

Where am I today then? I am waiting for my application to medical school to (hopefully!!!) be accepted!!! I'm honestly so blessed to have had this experience and my life has probably changed forever because of it. I think this is what Alan Watts meant by ""When you get the message, hang up the phone."" but I'm not entirely sure. 

Still, I think I am done with psychedelics for a while, I'll resume my exploration if or when I get another call.

Thank you so much for reading through my very long post. Love you all <3 :)",70,6031,12,1160,1

2019-09-24 11:21:28,Addiction is a progressive narrowing the things that bring you pleasure. Awakening is a progressive widening of the things that bring you pleasure.,"I decided to quit drinking and smoking weed in May 2017 after feeling like I hit rock bottom at the age of 27. 

Since then I have recovered my inner child, grown closer to my family, healed all my repressed trauma, let go of my internal drama with the help of ayahuasca (seven ceremonies), bufo (two sessions), shrooms (one time while on a roadtrip through the West Coast), and acid (a few times for 'old time's sake'). I enjoy my daily routine of waking up at 5am to start my day and living a simple, minimalist life striving to be service to others with my skills and knowledge.

I've scaled a creative agency while working at a tech company from an idea to a way to travel while working remotely. I've explored most of the lower 48 and went to Colombia during this time. In the next year, I will go to Mexico, Central America, Europe, Egypt, and Asia.

I've met a few cool mentors who have taught me a lot about life and work. I've dated a few interesting women who helped me realize what I wanted and didn't want. I am happily single right now and growing into the kind of man that could take care of a family if I ever wanted to do that.

I am working on some humanitarian and climate projects in my free time that I hope will make a world of difference for all of us. I turn 30 in January. I feel like a kid at heart but am an old soul through and through.

2022-11-18 14:41:05,I disowned my family after doing mushrooms,"I grew up in the hood, tried psychedelics, and afterwards I realized how TOXIC my family's culture was. They're all living the street life. They're all depressed and negative people. Combative people. Bad attitude having people. Negative worldview having people. The BEST WAY for me to describe them (and this is going to sound stupid) is imagine a group of people whose religious doctrine was RAP MUSIC. That's my family. That shit is literally the Bible to them smh. They literally LEARNED how to live life by watching rap videos smh. Rap is gospel to them.

I tried telling them about mushrooms but was quickly rejected because ""Black people don't do mushrooms."" So instead of continuing to deal with their negative attitudes towards me, I disowned them and left them.

I've been told that I'm an asshole for this. But all they wanna do is COMPETE and FIGHT. So I disowned them. If our relationship isn't going to consist of PEACE and LOVE, then I'd rather NOT KNOW YOU. Period. I've been dealing with people calling me fucked up for leaving my family, but what many don't understand is that my STANDARDS rose after psychedelics. I no longer want to be around people who DONT WANT to be happy. I no longer want to be around hood people. I don't even listen to RAP anymore. I don't like negative music anymore. I dont drink anymore. Im a DIFFERENT PERSON NOW. And people keep telling me that Im fucked up for choosing BETTER for myself. People have told me that I think Im BETTER.

He thought to himself I‚Äôll just go into my room listen to some music and just chill out. 2 hours later he said his stomach was feeling really bad and went into the washroom to PUKE he lifted the lid and yacked our pure RED blood. He told me he was tripping super hard and thought he was dying his puke was bright red, something was indeed wrong. He said he didn‚Äôt care and was shitting bricks so he went and told his mom what was going on, basically confessed to being on shrooms and that he is puking blood. His mom told him if it happens again she‚Äôs going to take him straight to the emergency room. 

Literally 5 minutes later he rushes back into the washroom opens the lid and puked bright blood again in front of his mom. My aunt freaked out and was speeding to the hospital. they show up to the emergency and the doctor immediately take my cousin and they start pumping his stomach with a tub down his throat. ALL THE WHILE HES TRIPPING balls. He said he didn‚Äôt know wtf was going on but that it was for sure the end for him that he took some poisonous mushrooms instead and it was a lethal dose he was seriously having a panic attack. Anyways he came down off the shrooms in the hospital and was released the next day. The doctors didn‚Äôt have an explanation to what caused it everything came back normal so they just assumed it was a rare occurrence and if it happened again to come back. 

Anyways 2 years later this guy is at a fucking party talking to this girl, and the subject of shrooms comes up. He starts telling her the emergency room story.

‚ÄúYeah one time I went to the emergency room because I was throwing up blood after eating some shrooms‚Äù

2020-05-18 17:18:29,Should we really call it a heroic dose?,"I have seen multiple ‚Äòbad trip‚Äô with ‚Äòbad continued effects‚Äô even after the initial experiences has worn off from ‚Äòmy first heroic dose‚Äô type trips.

I understand why we call it a heroic dose, but putting yourself at risk for largely only personal gain isn‚Äôt heroic. 

This is about self discovery not competition. Just because someone else took that dose and had positive impact doesn‚Äôt mean you should. 

Please. Ego death via heroic doses is not the same for everyone. Doubling and tripling previous high doses, especially alone, is going to have bad impacts on some people. Yes some people are fine. But so many write ups are like ‚Äòwanted Ego death because all this bad shit has been happening and I needed a reset‚Äô. If life is hectic, your head isn‚Äôt in a good state, you‚Äôre battling existing mental health issues - it is probably not time for a heroic dose. 

I am not saying that everyone should be in perfect mental health to use psychedelics. I‚Äôm saying that to get that breakthrough / heroic dose.... you should be in a solid place. 

I know this won‚Äôt resonate with all people. Just trying to help those that are lost and considering a hard reset. Go slow. It can get intense.

2021-05-31 09:33:41,"Took mushrooms as a last ditch ""fuck it what have I got to lose,"" attempt to work on myself and was blown away.","Coming down off my first **real** trip right now, sorry if this gets rambly as I'm still trying to process things. Screwed around with some low doses years ago when I was younger to see pretty colors but never had anything meaningful come from it until now.  


Been dealing with depression issues for years. I'd completely forgotten what actual happiness felt like. I would occasionally have fleeting moments of laughter, joy, pride, whatever, but it was always uncomfortable and felt completely unnatural. I would beat myself up over these ""good"" feelings, convincing myself I didn't deserve to feel that way. It was *wrong* for me to feel that way. I just wanted to be back wallowing in self pity and loneliness. Smoking weed heavily would make me feel less shitty for awhile but half the time it would end in spiraling thoughts of self-doubt and self-hatred over things that I couldn't control. Nevertheless, I would always go back to weed thinking ""at least this feels better than being sober.""  


I took about 4 grams of mushrooms earlier in an effort to have some type of healing experience like I had seen on various reddit posts and psych websites and the come up was rough to say the least. Negative thoughts would come and go rapidly and I would immediately try to think of something else, anything to avoid dwelling on things like I do with weed but obviously that didn't work for long and I ended up realizing that the things I was so upset and stressed over really don't mean a fucking thing in the grand scheme of things. I was *forcing* myself to feel badly. I didn't *want* to feel happiness. I had to forgive myself and stop limiting my feelings to such a dark corner when feelings and emotion is really what connects everyone in the end. We're all on the same boat traversing through life and while some might be in the captains quarters enjoying cocktails and some are hanging off the fucking bow for dear life, there is no destination. We're not going anywhere in an endless ocean and while there are storms that will rock the boat to its core, there are also moments of calmness, serenity, sunsets accompanied by rainbows and beauty but you'll never see it if you hide whenever the sun comes out and pretend you're just imagining things. There may be no meaning to any of it. Maybe there is, I don't know but I think human connection, allowing walls to be broken down, real genuine connection with people around us is something that we can always strive for I guess. In the end, that's all there really is. No one lies in their deathbed wishing they owned more drilling equipment or whatever, they want to be with the people they love. To feel at peace.  


After getting through this crazy thought train I felt extremely calm. I was listening to this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIpN3gJGUIw&list=PLwuwU\_0SxdcIc-5whdQTKf66T0jVrPEQD&index=9&t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIpN3gJGUIw&list=PLwuwU_0SxdcIc-5whdQTKf66T0jVrPEQD&index=9&t=0s)   
and my god. It turned into the most beautiful, transcendent moment of my life.  All I could do was lay there with my eyes closed and hand over my chest, completely enveloped by this feeling of completeness. It was like being a child again. In that moment I felt truly happy for the first time in years with no angry internal voice booming down at me to stop enjoying things. I was literally on the verge of tears it was so incredible. I'm still feeling some of the effects from this right now though not nearly as intense but I'm definitely realizing that I need to let myself be ok and let myself enjoy things before I truly can.   


I'm not sure what I expected going into this but I definitely think it was worth it even if it only means chipping away at things one piece at a time over brooding and telling myself I don't even deserve to try in the first place. There were some fun lighter moments though too! I sat down to pee at one point and got lost comparing the two towels hanging from my towel rack. One was thicker than the other and I think I sat there for about 30 minutes scrutinizing every detail only to come up with the conclusion that the thicker towel must be a luxurious 2-ply towel! As opposed to the other inferior single ply. Obviously a ridiculous ""revelation"" and one that led to some deep thinking on the similarities of toilet paper, bath towels and the ever mysterious paper towel. Didn't manage to come to a conclusion regarding my feeling on this but I'm chuckling about how stupid it was now.  


All in all though, I'm very glad I did it and will definitely try again at some point, though it might have to be a few months at least.

2023-04-09 14:44:45,I used to be a creep before LSD,"I don't wanna get too into it. That's the gist. I was kind of a stalker and definitely a really creepy person. It was even a persona I was proud of. I used LSD and it's like I saw everything that was wrong with me and I couldn't stop crying because of how I kept ruining everything and how I ruined all of my relationships by being such a fucking idiot. I was terrified. Not by the LSD. But by the thing I was doing. By how I lost the woman I loved due to my own fucking idiocy. That was a few months ago. I'm still not really over it and I don't know how to forgive myself or fix my relationships. I just want her back. I've been going to therapy as well. Thank you LSD. You saved me from myself.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for all the love and acceptance you showed me. I was never really an emotional person but I was in tears.  I wasn't entitled to the caring and love I received in this post and I was fully expecting to get downvoted to hell, but you guys showed me that love and peace is really the only way to face things. I never thought I'd sound so much like a hippie but it rings more true than I ever thought. If anyone ever needs help or anyone ever needs someone to talk to you, you can always message me. For a while my little realization made me hate myself, and it got me into psychiatric wards for slitting my neck and the like. I don't want that for anyone. I don't know if it's stupid to be so affected by an online forum, but I really love all of you guys. Whoever you are, whatever you have done, remember you are only who you choose to be. You can choose to repent and to treat the world with kindness, and that is what you will receive in return. Thank you so much, strangers.",31,1764,8,353,1
2020-05-11 11:55:57,Psychedelics are a tool not a solution.,"I have been seeing many posts and comments lately about people looking to solve an issue they have been dealing with by having a trip. Whether it is Psylocibin, LSD, Mescaline etc. they are not going to solve any of your problems. You should be looking for a solution within yourself and thats what psychedelics help you do.There is a lot of work that comes after tripping if you chose to address issues and if you're not ready to put the time in, then you definitely will not get what you want out of the psychedelics! 

Psychedelics are some extremely powerful tools which we are incredibly lucky to be able to benefit from! 

I wish you all nothing but the best! ‚úå

Edit: since you're all using a hammer for comparison, the way I see it is this 

Issue - Nail sticking out
Tool - Hammer 
Solution - Hitting the nail with the hammer 

It's not by taking the hammer out of the tool box that you fixed the nail sticking out. But by taking out the hammer, you're now able to hit the nail.",39,987,7,185,1
2020-01-13 13:20:23,"Meditation burns off concepts and builds concentration, it's like lifting weights for the mind. I've learned from life experience that the cause of suffering really is attachment (to the body, to things, to people, to sensations, to concepts, to identities).","I discovered Buddha and his teachings in 2009 when I was 19. This same phase is where I discovered cannabis, mushrooms, and LSD. Over the next decade, I got fully immersed in learning everything I could about the Cosmos and Dharma and striving to live in harmony with it. I learned about meditation at the Tibetan monastery in my city, it happened to be partnered with a major university nearby for neuroscience research.

My journey spanned across space and time as I studied the ancient world and tried to integrate it into modern life through creativity, service, and entrepreneurship. Around 25, I started to apply the 80/20 rule to my life every year and started to shed possessions, relationships, ambitions, vices. It's interesting how 64% of the total value comes from 4%.

By 27.5, I wasn't drinking beer or smoking weed and barely eating meat or processed foods. I was able to consolidate my life down to a backpack and a briefcase. It was liberating in many ways. Around this time, I went to an ayahuasca retreat and start to shed inner weights like resentments, fears, trauma, repressed emotions. I also started to see just how subtle the ego was in it's constant manipulating.

At the end of 2018, after a few months on the road exploring the National Parks, my grandmother had a stroke and I helped take care of her. In her final days, I saw first hand the things that inspired Buddha to leave the palace behind: aging, sickness, death, awakening. I started to realize a lot of things in a deeper way but felt Buddhism was not for me because it has become another -ism full of dogma. I still study Buddha though, funny thing is that he wasn't 'a Buddhist.'

In 2019, I began to study the connections between different civilizations and find the common ground. I met many characters in my travels clinging to concepts, identities, and ambitions. They reminded me of my younger days where I thought salvation was out there. I got into a routine of waking up at 5am and noticed 'time clutter' start to disappear. I noticed social media had much less appeal to me because it caused more suffering than joy, even reddit was losing it's appeal.

After another month long roadtrip in August, I revisited ayahuasca and got the message, 'You are the Way'. I went to a meditation retreat in December and the teacher started his first lecture with the same message: 'You are the Way.' That brings me to the present moment sharing this journey and what I've learned with you. I hope this message finds you well and helps you on your journey. I'm so grateful that we live in a world where it's possible to wake up and just be.",258,2627,40,466,1
2021-02-18 03:33:37,"I created a new decentralized social platform powered by a transparent algorithm designed to promote trust and unity in society, rather than division. Satellite needs users. If you agree with our mission I invite you to consider crossposting your essays there.","It's called [Satellite](https://satellite.earth).

Many of the early dreamers who built the Internet back in the 90's thought it would bring peace and global unity (and yes, they were fans of psychedelics - Terrance Mckenna talked about this). Unfortunately... as the Internet evolved it became dominated by large commercial platforms. Today it's obvious to everyone that ""social media"" (should be called \*anti-social\* media) has, for the most part, driven us apart and created more misunderstanding than ever. The fatal mistake was allowing cyberspace to become a giant hyper-targeted ads platform where everyone lives in their own media echo-chamber. r/psychonaut is a rare exception‚Äîwhich is why I'm posting here.

Anyway.

The content ranking algorithm that powers the feed in Satellite is different. Rather than showing content that is most ""engaging"" (i.e. addicting and bias-confirming) it identifies publishers that have received upvotes from other users, weighted by the votes the upvoters have received, further weighted by the votes *those* upvoters have received, and so on. The object is to identity authors who have received not necessarily \*a lot\* of upvotes, but rather \*diverse\* upvotes, thus proving their ability to express thoughts/ideas that simultaneously appeal to readers who have very different perspectives. Unifiers. Bridge-builders. *Leaders*. The social media algorithms that have driven society are designed to *sell ads* by puting people into smaller and smaller targeted groups. **Satellite is trying to do the opposite: to bridge and reconnect groups by elevating the voices that find common ground.** There's no guarantee it will work, but it's worth a try.

Well, thanks for reading this far. There'a a lot more to explain, and if you're curious I would invite you to read the ""Welcome to Satellite"" intro article that you'll find on the front page. I'm happy to answer any questions here or on Satellite.

Edit: Wow thank you everyone I did not expect this. In case there's any confusion, I just want to clarify one thing: **Satellite does not require cryptocurrency or money of any kind, ever!** The only reason you need MetaMask is to provide a secure storage location for the secret key that you use to prove your identity.

2020-08-16 09:19:27,Was high so long being sober is the biggest trip,"I smoked weed every day for 7, nearly 8 years. Some of that time was 2 grams a day... Easy. I‚Äôve had dozens of psychedelic trips... Mushrooms, LSD, synthetic... DMT... I‚Äôve done basically every street drug, and beyond. Heroin and crack being the exceptions. Drugs were my vice; They kept me from slipping off the edge after chasing the woman of my dreams away with complacency and depression. It took turning 25... 5 years after she fucked me off and looking over 30 for me to realize if I didn‚Äôt change things now, I was going to lose all my hair and teeth and be a legit bum junkie. I‚Äôve been sober a bit over six weeks; working in mining, 12 hours a day every day of the week. I‚Äôve had to completely change my habits, and work harder then most can even imagine. Being sober the longest ever in what would be over 8 years, is a trip I can‚Äôt even explain. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a bigger trip then 7 grams of mushrooms or DMT... But fuck I‚Äôve learnt things about myself in just a few weeks I could‚Äôve never expected to see through sobriety. Yes I am drinking and smoking ciggies... But not having a bong or vape attached to my face to deal with with my day and suicidal thought has been an insane way to learn how people interact on their primitive level, and how I do. I didn‚Äôt realize how lost I was in my little bubble. I wouldn‚Äôt communicate with anyone unless I had to, either because I was high at work or waiting until I got home so I could be. Yes I learnt a lot, and yes it kept me alive through the darkest parts of my life... But fuck I squandered years of what should‚Äôve been golden years... Trying to stay alive when I‚Äôve possibly shortened a life I‚Äôm now ready to do something with.
My advice to y‚Äôall is to realize substance abuse isn‚Äôt an excuse to be fucking weak and waste your life. I believe in reincarnation, and still wish I‚Äôd set myself up in my early youth instead of working deadshit jobs so I could be high at work and barely support myself and my drug habit. I don‚Äôt have any regrets at the end of the day... But if someone had the courage to say, ‚Äòhey mate your running yourself into the ground in your golden years, and WILL perceive it as wasted time... You can do anything and be anyone, even if you wish you started working towards it a bit earlier...‚Äô Maybe I would‚Äôve listened. We don‚Äôt have a route into adulthood, we don‚Äôt have support and explanation of what really awaits us for the next 50+ years of our lives. Without going into too much detail about how fucked society is; I think working your ass off and treating it as a vice instead of drugs in your youth, can completely change your life and prevent you from working your whole life and being a cog in a machine. Long hours is the same as sitting on the bong or pipe; And it gives you the resources to actually do something.

2020-05-13 15:43:18,"""I wish in a way that I could get a slightly better grip on my cannabis use, because I think the real way to do cannabis is like once a week, by yourself, in silent darkness, with the strongest stuff you can get, and then immense amounts of it."" ‚ÄîTerence McKenna","I can absolutely attest to this idea.

For quite awhile, I smoked cannabis like it was the oxygen I needed. I'd wake up, immediately take a hit, eat breakfast, take a hit, do whatever, and take a hit. 24/7 I was high. It absolutely lost its magic and it no longer felt like a high, but rather a relaxation.

I decided to take a break, maybe a week or two, and it felt like *forever.*  I felt like being sober was like a movie. I was no longer as self-aware and I couldn't look at myself as the director anymore but rather the actor following his script. Whenever I'm high, I can catch myself doing things that I didn't really choose to do and I'll take control back. But when sober? The lines are very blurred.

When I saw what Terence had once said, I decided to try it. Mainly because I didn't wanna devout so much time in a world that's not the real thing. Weed numbs me to what I'm really feeling, so to have a week of work and sobriety really gets me in touch with myself.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

So, after that quick little break, on a windy Friday night, I decided to hit this pen I have. A solid 10 second hit, three times. I have reached heights I never thought possible. I was so incredibly uncomfortable for the first 10mins, but then a bliss filled me. Like my skin turned into lead and my limbs just felt so warm and comfortable no matter how I laid them. I felt *every*  cool particle launched by the fan hit my skin. It was like laying the world's lightest, coolest blanket on my skin, and it'd just fall and wrap around me, continuously.

The sound of the fan blades slicing through the air became so clear and sharp. The hum of the electricity became a vibration that filled the room. The wind passing through the branches of the trees outside my window spoke to me in a way that grappled my ears. It was a soft, white noise that sounded so perfect. I felt as though I could pinpoint every sound I heard.

A sort of film was layered over my vision, like I became aware of a screen that usually goes unnoticed. It was dark, but colored in blues, and reds. Green waves of opaque light would run through my field of view, chased by a contrasting, darker blue. They would follow eachother perfectly, and seamlessly. Rounding about in spirals, to flat walls, and back again. It felt like I could control them if I focused enough.

Transparent, interconnected, stretched hexagons of ever-changing, dark-toned blues and reds and greens followed everywhere I looked.

I felt truly at peace. Like I could've fallen into eternity and been completely content. I could recall so many past memories I had thought were long lost. Friends I had completely lost touch with. I felt whole.

Then I slept.",262,2685,51,496,1
2020-01-21 04:07:14,Derealization-depersonalization disorder is not enlightenment! Stop telling people that it is please,"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts on here from people saying they don‚Äôt feel like themselves or they feel like they live their lives through some kind of lens. This is not healthy nor is it enlightenment. We can argue and discuss what it means to be enlightened, but the effects of this disorder are quite severe and do not benefit the individual. 

If you feel like you‚Äôre living your own life through a lens or that everyday you are playing some sort of game through your body, you should seek professional psychological help. I say this due to my own experience with the disorder, which I once believed was ‚Äúenlightenment.‚Äù The sad truth is that this problem prevented me from experiencing my own thoughts and emotions as fully and authentically as possible. Before you write some long paragraph about why I‚Äôm wrong ask yourself this: would all the wise teachers of history and myth really advocate for you to be separated from your own thoughts, emotions, body, or life? 

I write all of this not out of hatred or a desire to prove myself right, but rather out of love. Once you stop feeling like yourself or like you‚Äôre not living your own life, you are no longer truly in touch with yourself. There‚Äôs a difference between mindfulness and drug-induced derealization/depersonalization or even psychosis. Masters of meditation and prayer don‚Äôt see their lives through a lens or become dissociated, they become more in-touch with themselves and capable of control through practice of cognitive self-discipline. 

Please be careful out there and, if anything, stop smoking or tripping for a while and see how you feel.

2020-09-22 15:18:19,"Our atoms have been inside of stars, and floated suspended in outer space for longer than our species has existed","*I got really excited about this idea and wondered what the full story of the* [*atoms*](https://bigideas.network/origins-of-atoms/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=long-form&utm_campaign=r-psychonaut) *in our bodies was. So I did some research and created this post.*

**Edit 2:** [Part II is on Reddit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/iyyt9l/your_atoms_have_been_inside_of_the_magma_ocean/).

Most of the atoms in your body are 13.7 billion years old, and being you is just the latest page in the incredible story of their life.

We know for sure that they‚Äôve been inside of stars, and floated suspended in outer space for far longer than our species has been around.

They‚Äôve washed through the chemical cycles of the Earth countless times, which might have included being frozen to the top of a mountain in one eon, to stomping through dense jungles as part of the thigh bone of a brontosaurus in the next.

[Our atoms are quite the travellers](https://preview.redd.it/57lwntn14po51.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4f15f8930e8268d93f7a67042eba692e5b78d79d)

We can use modern science to see the story of us from its true beginning. Along the way we will discover how we are born from the universe, not separate, like a wave that emerges from an ocean.

[Atoms](https://bigideas.network/origins-of-atoms/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=long-form&utm_campaign=r-psychonaut) are the minuscule LEGO blocks of everything we see around us. They make up the cells that make up our bodies, and although cells have a lifespan of a few days to a few years, most atoms will coast around the universe for 10 million billion billion billion years before they break down. They are practically immortal (with the exception of [radioactive atoms](https://bigideas.network/nuclear-waste/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=long-form&utm_campaign=r-psychonaut)).

To find out where their story starts, the lens we have to use is a field of science called astrochemistry, which is the study of molecules in the universe.

The different types of atoms (called [elements](https://bigideas.network/elements/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=long-form&utm_campaign=r-psychonaut)) have slightly different but parallel stories, though they all begin in the same place; the Big Bang.

## The Plasma Storm

While the nature of the Big Bang itself remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science, we do have a good grasp on what happened immediately afterwards.

From a microscopic point, the universe erupted outwards in a condition of unimaginable heat and pressure. From the sheer amount of energy coursing through the fabric of reality, the first [quarks](https://bigideas.network/the-standard-model/) seared into existence like waves erupting from a turbulent ocean.

Within minutes, quarks joined together to form [protons and neutrons](https://bigideas.network/images-of-atoms/).¬†They formed an opaque cloud of plasma¬†so vast that it stretched across the new universe. It rippled with light and electricity, and may have looked something like a combination of being inside a plasma globe or the most intense lightning storm of all time.

The universe passed 240,000¬†years in this dense, violent plasma storm, a time so long on human timescales that it would have encompassed the entire history of our species.

But the same explosive force of the Big Bang that created the plasma storm kept the universe expanding, and eventually, it started to cool off.

The electricity which rippled through the cloud began to combine with its protons and neutrons to form the transparent gasses hydrogen and helium, and thus the first complete atoms to exist in the universe.

About 60% of the atoms in our bodies are directly descended from this hydrogen and helium.

The plasma storm began to fade and was replaced by this new, transparent cloud, and the universe began to resemble space as we now know it.

## Inside a Star

In the cold silence of space, your atoms would have been witness to one of the most sublime visions in the universe: the formation of the Milky Way galaxy through a veil of a nebula.

https://preview.redd.it/bvhusukiosp51.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=56e1cae85b13765d2ac44a022fc92fac6e8c5cd7

At this point the remaining 40% of our atoms began to diverge from hydrogen and helium.

They started to feel the pull of gravitation. First subtly and slowly, but soon like a colossal riptide, they were pulled into the gravity well of a still-forming giant star, one of the ancestors of our Sun.

As more material fell into the growing star, the pressure felt by your atoms climbed to over 250 billion times the pressure of our atmosphere. A dull glow began as the star ignited, which soon became a heat and light hotter and brighter than anything we could imagine.

Your atoms spent hundreds of millions of years here, adrift in the ebb and flow of the internal storms of the star.

Some fell deep into the star‚Äôs core. Here they were subject to pressure that was extreme compared even to the rest of the star, and in this furnace atoms of hydrogen and helium fused together to become oxygen, carbon, iron and other elements, releasing bursts of heat and light as they merged.

In the present day, the light from the Sun that warms your skin and the flickering of light from the stars at night originates from the same brutal process of fusion.

After three to four million years the giant star began to run out of its hydrogen and helium fuel. At the same time, its waste products of oxygen, carbon, and iron began to build up, and its light dimmed.

It erupted in a supernova explosion, a blast so violent that it would have been visible from across the other other side of the Milky Way galaxy, if there was anyone there to see it.

https://i.redd.it/j1pl187qosp51.gif

The searing explosion fused other atoms, creating more oxygen and carbon, as well as rarer elements like silicon, chlorine, and sodium.

The shockwave pushed the newly formed elements back into what was left of the original hydrogen and helium cloud, disrupting it and seeding it with countless new types of atoms.

As the shockwave impacted surrounding gas, it compressed millions of miles of hydrogen and oxygen together to form icy water.

Disrupted from the blast, the gas cloud began to once again feel the pull of gravitation.

But this time, it was full of ice and new rocky elements, which clumped together and grew larger and larger. From the cloud hundreds of new, smaller stars were forming, and possibly planets too.

This cycle repeated a number of times until eventually, one of the new stars was our Sun.

In the small part of the cloud that our Sun occupied, most of the remaining hydrogen, helium, and now other elements too, were once again captured by gravity and were destined to be set adrift in the internal stellar storms all over again.

But some of the gas and rocks found themselves not being pulled in to the Sun, but held in orbit in a vast ring around it called an ‚Äòaccretion disc‚Äô.

https://preview.redd.it/qcuji93vosp51.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9696994015537aa87cd9f63e0c19355c074be6d

Over time they collided with each other, forming larger and larger asteroids in a series of impacts until they grew to the size of planets, which were bombarded by asteroids for hundreds of millions of years.

https://preview.redd.it/wjs8yvuxosp51.jpg?width=926&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=447b24caabae58ff1809ac93a85d8ec7f396065e

When it ignited, the Sun released a series of immense shockwaves that impacted the new planets and determined the shape of the new ‚Äòsolar system‚Äô.

It pushed most of the gas outwards, towards the outer planets, where it formed the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus.

The heavy, rocky material closest to the Sun was left behind by the shockwave, and it formed the small, rocky planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, with a thin remnant of gassy atmosphere for each of them.

One of the main scientific goals of the missions sent to the Moon and Mars was to gather and analyse their soil, in order to discover the composition of the accretion disc that formed the planets.

Information like this helps us determine if the conditions on Earth are in some way unique, and if this could account for why there is life here. As it turns out, if there is something unique about the Earth, it‚Äôs not the soil.

Over time the asteroid bombardments slowed down, and the atoms that would eventually form you found themselves all in one place; Earth.

It's been almost two years since I drank ayahuasca and a month since bufo but I STILL feel the benefits of the whole experience. I understand the title quote and strive to live in harmony with Nature/God.

I tripped on mushrooms for the first time when I was 19 after a Halloween party. I remember feeling like the Joker, a bit crazy in a very crazy world and feeling the need to connect deeper to my ancestry and to nature. That was 2009.

Over the last decade, I've experimented with some high-quality acid, a variety of mushrooms, a lot of cannabis. In 2017, I was called to ayahuasca and San Pedro. The two of them reconnected me to the miraculous nature of existence and made me feel like a child before the Creator.

In May, I revisited ayahuasca to process a lot of major changes in my life and to get even more established in this new way of life. I had a very powerful experience that I plan to do a full write-up about soon. After that, I went to Florida where I smoked bufo, which Michael Pollan called the 'Mount Everest of psychedelics'. Write-up coming soon!

I feel that I will visit entheogens as I am called to or as they end up in front of me from a person I trust. I never went looking for shrooms, acid, DMT, ayahuasca, San Pedro, or bufo...they found me through really good friends and I trusted them because I knew many people I admire experimented with entheogens in their creative/spiritual journey.

So grateful for the times we live in despite all the chaos all around. Also grateful for this sub where we can connect and see progress happen in our individual lives and in the collective psyche of humanity.

EDIT: 

&#x200B;

I get where the top comment is coming from but I think this misses the point of the quote. The author was an astrophysicist who was keenly aware of humanity's positive potential too. 

There is no differentiation to me when I read the quote. I just sense a sober description of human history.

I believe Reality is beyond concepts and words, music and math do a much better way of describing the indescribable.

Imagine the world without fire, without the wheel, without writing or numbers, without science or industry, without telecommunications or technology. I am grateful for all of it but I sense the need for evolution to continue.

It's good that many are keen to point this out though, it means there are many in this sub who think critically and use their brains. Evolution is happening in real-time and real-space!

We are a way for the Cosmos to know Itself.

After a shit day at work I came home and was planning on taking 3 gs of shrooms and playing some guitar as I've done many times before.  When weighing out the shrooms I didn't realize the scale was set to oz and not grams and was already stoned so wasn't really paying attention. I weighed out .3 oz (roughly 8.5gs) thinking it was 3gs and threw it in a smoothie.

About 30 minutes in I knew it was going to be a strong trip but still didn't realize how much I took so I wasn't concerned.  So I started playing guitar with some pretty intense visuals/emotional connection with what I was playing.  Both things I had experienced before.  Then at the 2hr or so mark in the trip something crazy happened.

I completely left my body and was looking at myself sitting in a chair still playing guitar.  My strumming arm was moving almost robotically and I had no conscious control over anything my body was doing.  I was simply listening to myself play without knowing what I played.  The next day I thought I might have imagined this but my roommate confirmed I had continued playing.

2020-12-29 20:08:59,I Used to Think That Psychedelic Drugs Were Stupid & Bad For you... Until I Had my First Trip Yesterday,"I (28F) grew up religious, being taught that mind altering drugs were horrendous for you. Whenever I saw stereotypical hippie stuff it always seemed ridiculous and weird, just silly stoner bro stuff. Someone ""tripping out"" was always part of a punch line.

As I was letting go of my Christianity and eventually became atheist, I became more and more open to the idea of trying drugs. I got drunk for the first time at 23 and didn't try weed until I was 25. As my mind opened up more, I came to realize that recreational drugs aren't inherently dangerous or bad for you if used appropriately. So I became curious and open to trying shrooms, as my boyfriend was telling me a few accounts of his experience (both good and bad)

I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I thought it'd be just slightly more intense then weed. Just a fun dopey ride where I'd feel relaxed and maybe giggle a lot.

But my boyfriend stressed that I really needed to carve out a whole day for it if I wanted to do it, and that he would be sober for me during the trip to make sure I'm safe, having a good time and could supply me with whatever I needed.

With yesterday being boxing day and us having nothing else planned except for video games I decided that yesterday would be the day I finally try it out - and holy freaking shit.

In the beginning it was quite uncomfortable. I could feel myself getting hot and my heart beating outta my chest. It was honestly a little concerning and I was starting to get a little anxious. Cyberpunk 2077(video game) was starting to get over stimulating for me and I had to lay down. At that point I was actually a little frustrated, thinking that weed was sooo much better then this.

But once I was lying down and calming myself down and letting myself know that it would be okay... everything got so, so, SO much better. Everything started to breath and move all around me. Everything seemed so much more vibrant then ever before. The self love and appreciation I started to feel for myself and my body was incredible. I've generally been pretty positive about myself and my body, but the love I felt while on the trip was so unreal. It was strange being so alert and conscious, while everything around me is melting and molding together.

I'm so fortunate to have had my boyfriend with me during the entire thing. He was fantastic and I'm so grateful to him. He kept checking in on me, made a little blanket nest for me to feel safe and comfortable and listened to everything I had to say about what I was experiencing and thinking about. Whenever I started crying (tears of joy) he somehow knew not to interfere and to just let me be in my feelings and feel through everything.

Eventually he came over to me and asked if I wanted to cuddle. Up to that point I had been experiencing everything mainly visually, so when he started to touch me EVERYTHING changed. All of my sensations were heighted to an impossibly high degree. I had never felt so many things in my life that felt so good. When I touched, rubbed and kissed him it felt like I was melting into him. His hair on his head felt like silk, but far superior. As I was making out with him and we started to have sex, it felt as if my body was dissipating and I was a part of everything. There was a point where I didn't know where my body began and my boyfriends ended, it felt like we were one entity, like we were a part of everything. I remember thinking in that moment that this is what sex was truly made to be. During and after my bf gave me so many affirmations, letting me know how much he loved and cared for me. I have never felt so loved, safe, and secure then I did in that moment.

It was truly a life changing experience. From science I've learned that all matter is recycled, so the matter that is comprised of you today was used to create something else and so on. It's one thing to understand that from a academic point of view, but to actually experience it and have no doubt in your mind that you are LITERALLY a part of everything around you is a WHOLE other thing.

It's so weird having this level of certainty about it. Going through that trip gave me so many answers, but also humbled me in realizing that there is so much more to learn and we haven't even scratched the surface yet. It was so comforting to have the realization that these bodies are only temporary, and not the end-all-be-all. I realized that I worry about so much shit that in the grand scheme of things just doesn't matter.

This was such a special, life changing journey for me to experience and I'm so grateful for it. It feels absolutely insane and unjust that shrooms are criminalized and stigmatized as a dangerous substance.

\-------------------------

**TL:DR**

Growing up I thought shrooms were bad because religion said so. I eventually became atheist and got the stick out of my ass and tried some yesterday with my bf being my trip sitter. It was an amazing life changing experience. I can't believe how wrong I was.",103,5000,20,927,1
2023-03-04 13:36:04,I'm a Black man who walked away from rap culture after taking mushrooms,"I'm a Black man, and mushrooms made me realize that rap culture is bullshit. I walked away from the culture. I don't even listen to the music anymore. But when I look around and I SEE other Black people who are brainwashed by rap, it hurts. EVERYBODY that I know who is in rap culture is lost. SMH. 

My family thinks I'm a sellout. A coon. All because I don't think it's a good idea to drink alcohol and listen to murder music everyday, and I expressed it to them. They are in LOVE with rap culture. They are in LOVE with dysfunction. I've SEEN how this culture has kept many people back in life. I had to walk away from my family because they have no humanity. Smh. They're just a bunch of lost people. They listen to rap music, and then they GO OUT into the real world and try to LIVE that shit. It's a damn shame. It keeps them broke. It keeps them going to jail. It keeps them drunk. It keeps them unstable. Following rap culture smh.

Maybe this whole thing is subjective. Maybe these are just MY opinions, but rap culture is a disease. And EVERYBODY that I know who is living it, is struggling. I don't even listen to rap anymore. I can't believe I grew up in that culture and it took shrooms in order for me to finally SEE IT for what it is. All it glorifies, all it promotes, is DYSFUNCTION. And sadly, there are many people in the world who listen to that music, and their life becomes a nightmare as a result. It's just sad man. I'm a lone wolf now because I'm the only Black man in my family who DOES NOT want to be a thug anymore. It's fucking sad

2020-07-03 20:30:59,The human race needs a psychedelic revolution now more than ever.,"I don't normally like posting opinions like this, but this has been itching me for the past four months the pandemic has been going on.

When COVID started to spread globally, I was scared and anxious for myself, my family, my loved ones, the state of the government... But, I had this inkling of hope that something as global like this would pull us together and maybe make us all more connected. I don't regret being hopeful, but I'm disappointed in the shape of all communities.

It seems we're even more torn apart now. All I see and hear about is arguments. Arguments about politics, rights, wearing a mask... It hurts my hopes of our species ever being one.

The other day, I saw a post on here linking an AMA post about a 14-year-old with brain cancer. It quoted the teenager saying that the purpose of life is love - to create and give it. I couldn't agree more. I see so much selfishness, lack of will to consider others' perspectives, etc. Granted, I'm not perfect either, and I occasionally forget to see the other side. But, that's where psychedelics come in. They've made me so much more open-minded, in tune to the world and to other people. They've made me realize that I'm not the only one living a life. There are other people out there focused on their own days too, and while my well-being is my priority, their well-being is their priority, and I think not respecting that is what fosters ""selfishness"".

The human race needs more love and acceptance. Awareness. Respect. We need more acceptance for psychedelic use. Not to force people into using it, but to make it an acceptable practice, such as Marijuana has become. We need to properly educate and change the connotation. I've found so many benefits from them that I consider psychedelics to have saved my life, as I'm sure plenty of others have.

It's just unfortunate that this revolution will take time. I know, slow and steady wins the race. Sometimes I just fear that the hatred will take over before the love does.

Edit: I wanted to add that I've been reading all the comments, and I really enjoy everyone's perspective. It's nice to hear both similar and slightly differing ones.

A few have said that we're already in a Psychedelic Renaissance, and I see what they mean now. 

Also, a few have mentioned that the AMA was someone faking it and karma-farming... I didn't know that until I read the comments on this post. Unfortunate. Regardless, the quote I had read from it on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/hhziq3/incredibly_insightful_ama_of_a_14_year_old_with/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), item #4, still struck a chord with me. I don't think their persona has to be genuine for their choice of words to hold meaning. It just disconnects their credibility.

2022-04-23 10:34:16,LSD temporarily pulled the anorexia-tinted glasses off of me,"EDIT: I'm reading all of your comments as they come and have cried many tears from all the support. I've felt so alone in my own head for many years dealing with all of this. Thank you internet strangers for your love and support, I feel a little less alone in all of this right now.

I had the most beautiful and life altering trip today. 4 tabs of acid, not sure what the dose was. I didn't care.

I painted, discovered a new love of funk music, and came face to face with the eating disorder that's currently killing me.

Sitting on the floor, covered in paint, grooving with that 1970s disco vibe. I became hyper aware of the fact that I could feel my bones against the floor. I couldn't get comfortable. I thought about this for a moment longer than intended, looked down at my legs, and was thrown face first into the reality of my anorexia. 

Acid allowed me to briefly see my situation from a non-disordered perspective. For the first time in my relevant life I saw myself and my body as it actually is- I am malnourished, underweight, medically unstable, and I need help. 

So now I am going to get help. In the morning I'm going to call a few treatment facilities and see about beginning this step towards recovery. I am terrified, now that I'm sober and the disorder has re-consumed my neural pathways. But I can't ignore this any more. I will die if I don't get help.

I don't think I'll be using acid again any time soon, it's served it's purpose for me at this point in my life. I've been seeking a life altering trip since the beginning of my psychonaut journey, and it's finally found me. I always thought it would be some spiritual revolution, lol.

I allowed my body to have what it needed - sometimes dancing, sometimes resting on the floor or bed. My hips were incredibly sore at times. I had a good cry and a sobbing session where a ton of grief boiled up and the tightness in my hips disappeared. My body felt relaxed after. I sat to meditate for a moment and an intense feeling of shame came over me. Dark red and black swirls of a dragon-like creature overtook the beautiful rainbow fractals I had been seeing, and I met my shame monster. My cheeks flushed with deep embarrassment and I felt mortified. I placed my hand on my heart and rubbed it gently. I said, ""It's ok. You are human. Everyone feels this way sometimes. I love you. It's ok. You are human. I love you."" I loved that shame monster so hard that it dissolved from view. It just melted away.

2020-09-07 13:53:01,There is a limit to the heroic dose,"So I just wanted to take a second to address something that I'm sure most of us have seen at one point or another in the psychedelic community. People boasting about having taken absurd doses like 15g mushroom trips or 10 tab acid trips. I'm sure a good 90 percent of them are lying or exaggerating at least but still I'm sure there are some people out there doing this for real. I'm not going to try to make any argument regarding safety or tell anyone what to do but I just wanted to address the fact that more doesn't always mean better.

If you think about taking a psychedelic as entering another world of thought you can imagine that when you trip you have one foot in our reality and one foot in the psychedelic realm. We benefit from tripping by taking information and inspiration from the psychedelic realm and bringing it back into our current waking reality. Terence McKenna has said before during a talk that he doesnt believe there is any need to take any dosage higher than 10g (in regards to psilocybin mushrooms) because at a certain point ""your capability of reportage is completely compromised"". Meaning that the more you take, the deeper you step into the psychedelic realm until the point where you no longer have any footing in our reality. This makes it a lot harder, if not impossible to bring any information back.

This is my only problem with DMT compared to Ayahuasca. Don't get me wrong, I love DMT but compared to mushrooms and LSD I've always found that once I get back it feels like 90% of the information I just recieved has slipped through my figers like a dream. I would personally prefer the long, slow release of ayahuasca in order to properly retain as much as possible but this is just personal preference. Anyway to return to my main point, more doesn't always mean better. The benefit in psychedelics comes from what you're able to take back with you, not how much you can fit in your mouth. The heroic dose is 5g-10g, anything beyond is the Icarus dose.

Thanks for reading friends, much love!

&#x200B;

Edit: Since a bunch of people seem to be misinterperating what I'm saying I just want to clarify that I'm NOT saying that these insane doses are pointless. I'm saying if your goal is to bring something back with you from the psychedelic world then there is a sweet spot in which to do that where it is easiest to bring back information/inspiration. More isn't always better, it depends on your what your intent is.",35,2460,8,442,1
2020-06-06 16:04:53,LSD Mice,"so we've been having issues with mice in our house lately, its an old house and there's nothing we can do to stop them from getting in at this point, we did the whole trap thing, caught a few of them but they just keep coming. my cousin had the idea to poison them and we decided not to because if they die in the walls it will attract flies and make the house smell. so i jokingly suggested putting LSD in peanut butter and letting them eat it and hopefully they'll trip the fuck out and become scared of the house or something along those lines. the very next day my cousin comes back and he has a vile of about 30 hits of acid...... we then proceed to mix the LSD with the extra chunky peanut butter and place it in bottle lids around the house where there were recent rodent sightings. Later that night we decided it would be a great time to take some and so we both ingested about half a hit... about an hour later we were starting to come up. somehow we ended up watching The Great Mouse Detective, unaware of the coincidence. We got around halfway through the movie when we heard some noises coming from down the hall, and then we remembered what we had done and both started laughing maniacally. so we both get up to check and sure enough we see scurrying mice running away from the mini caches of psychedelic peanut butter. we went back to the living room and finished the movie, at this point were both really tripping and starting to have laughing fits. That's when shit got weird... a mouse dashes into the living room and smacks straight into the wall as if it was able to go through solid objects and when it hit the wall it ricocheted about 4 inches away laying on its side it starts to flail its legs and so its starts to spin in a circle and at this point were both in awe and pissing our pants laughing, i mean its uncontrollable. then i start to cry because i realized that the mouse is probably having a terrible trip, so we scooped him up and put him in a little cardboard box with some soft tissue, water and an apple slice. moral of the story, don't give mice LSD.

2021-06-14 04:58:19,Advice: Lower your dosages,"Users of psychedelics, I advise you to lower your dosages. I will explain why and if you agree perhaps you can try it out.

The thing is, the truth is not ""out"" there. The truth is right here and now... I think there is some implicit notion people have that spirituality is like a funny little game we play or separate from reality, and that they essentially have to YEET themselves into oblivion with heroic doses of LSD, Mushrooms, or breakthrough doses of DMT to access it.

But this ISN'T just a funny joke we imagine for laughs, it is not separate from reality, it is here. All the answers you seek are not necessarily found by obliterating yourself into fractals, but by turning your attention inwards

The intense visions and thoughts can in fact potentially act as a distraction. If you are focused on pretty colors you are not focusing on the self.

Psychedelics can invoke mystical experiences in ego death, but I don't think you need to journey this far when the thing you may be seeking is ever-present.

Try a different approach. Meditate, then once you are calm smoke a very light dose of DMT, and simply sit and continue to meditate, look inwards, look for the thing which observes, not the observed. It is in the calm that the true Self springs forth. When chaos gives way to nothingness. Not so much when flying at 1000mph through hallways full of jester apparitions.

You don't leave reality to access spirituality, it is not separate from reality. It is every bit as real as the world you sit and read this in right now. It is here all the time. The true Self is here right now.",26,1597,4,289,1

2020-03-11 02:41:29,Connected with a past version of myself on a previous trip while on LSD,"Around a year ago, I had a day off and took a quarter tab before going for a walk. The psychedelic effects were super light, except for this one unusual moment where I stopped under a group of cherry blossom trees and took my shoes off, and felt connected to something really powerful and indescribable. For a few minutes, it felt like I was on a significantly heavier dose, but it passed quickly. I put my shoes back on and continued on my walk without overthinking it, but it was a nice moment that‚Äôs always stuck with me. 

Going forward to present day, I recently took some LSD with a couple friends one night. We planned on making some collaborative art and having a fun time, but the tabs were stronger than we planned for. It was becoming almost impossible to verbally communicate, much less paint, and I started struggling to remember who I was or that we were on acid. At this point, I went to lie down in a dark room and just go with it. At the peak, I had an out of body experience and saw myself from a third person point of view, but couldn‚Äôt remember any details about my life anymore. I saw my former self dead at a funeral, but had lost all interest in who I had been or how I had died. It didn‚Äôt really matter, and I became countless flowers and blades of grass on a hillside, stretching on through a landscape. 

Then I saw a view of a person walking down a path with their shoes off, under the cherry blossom trees, and realized it was the previous version of myself from a year ago, on a much lower dose of LSD. I experienced the moment again, this time from the point of view of the grass, flowers, and trees. And while the concept of chronological order did sort of vaguely register, it really felt like the past and present were connected. I recognized myself walking on the grass, but was now part of everything else at the same time. And I also finally understood why I had felt so unusually connected to something incomprehensible for a few moments a year ago on that quarter tab. 

I don‚Äôt know what the point of this was, but it might have been the most unusual experience I‚Äôve had while tripping. LSD is really not a drug to be underestimated, even at what a lot of people consider microdoses.",71,2222,14,417,1

# Travelling across the Earth

Once they found their way to the Earth, your atoms began to cycle through the [air, land, and water](https://bigideas.network/states-of-matter/).

At this point, it‚Äôs hard to track exactly where they went but we do know that they have been very well recycled.

[The early Earth](https://preview.redd.it/avcbf0twf4p51.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9ff4da769d9f0c5031064a824630b3a53ce35cef)

The average person is made of seven octillion atoms, which is a number so great that it is almost impossible to conceptualise. Seven octillion is a seven followed by twenty-five zero‚Äôs. If you had seven octillion standard-sized bricks, they‚Äôd fill the volume of the planet Jupiter‚Ä¶ four times over.

With so many atoms scattered wide across the planet, the story of your atoms is also the story of the Earth. They have formed everything from the magma ocean underneath the continents to the peaks of mountains, and helped make the bodies of **millions of creatures before they made you**.

A handful of your atoms may have been used in one of the very first molecules of RNA at [the birth of life on Earth](http://bigideas.network/self-replicating-molecule/).

Others may have been used in one of the mandibles of a five-eyed Opabinia regalis, a tiny three-inch predator during the Cambrian Explosion.

Others may have been part of the muscle tissue of both a Tyrannosaurus and its prey.

In the chaos of Earth‚Äôs ever-changing chemistry, your seven octillion atoms have truly been everywhere.

>Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you. We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that a significant number of our atoms ‚Äî up to a billion for each of us, it has been suggested ‚Äî probably once belonged to Shakespeare. A billion more each came from Buddha and Genghis Khan and Beethoven, and any other historical figure you care to name... When we die, our atoms will disassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere ‚Äî as part of a leaf or other human being or drop of dew.  
>  
>Bill Bryson, *A Short History of Nearly Everything*

After 4 billion years, your atoms came together through the food you ate and the air you breathed to create your hands, heart, and the eyeballs you‚Äôre using to read these words.

Your carbon atoms were very recently part of a plant, and considering our modern diet, it was probably corn or wheat.

The plant absorbed [carbon dioxide](https://bigideas.network/carbon-dioxide/) molecules floating in the air and using the Sun‚Äôs light as a catalyst, the green cells of the plant combined them into a long carbohydrate [molecule](https://bigideas.network/how-atoms-form-molecules/). You recently ate it as part of bread, corn starch, or sugar.

The last glass of [water](https://bigideas.network/water/) you drank has also gone through a monumental journey. It‚Äôs part of a constant cycle of rain and evaporation driven by the heat of the Sun, while occasionally getting diverted through the belly of an animal or plant.

You might have seen a diagram of the water cycle like the one below in school, but what it doesn‚Äôt make clear is the scale of this process. Water is exchanged across the **entire surface of the Earth for billions of years at a time.**

The atoms in your saliva might have once been a wave that pushed Christopher Columbus‚Äô *Santa Maria* across the Atlantic, or an avalanche that toppled Hannibal‚Äôs elephants down the Alps. Your distant ancestors will be partially made of the iceberg that sank the *Titanic*.

&#x200B;

But the atoms that we have now are not the atoms that we'll keep. In fact, they are replaced about once every ten years.

Steve Grand in his book *Creation: Life and How to Make It* points out that because our atoms are in constant flux, our bodies are more like a wave than a permanent thing. He invites us to do a quick thought experiment:

>Think of an experience from your childhood ‚Äî something you remember clearly, something you can see, feel, maybe even smell, as if you were really there.  
>  
>After all, you really were there at the time, weren‚Äôt you? How else would you remember it?  
>  
>But here's the bombshell: You weren‚Äôt there.  
>  
>Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place.  
>  
>Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are, therefore, you are not the stuff of which you are made.  
>  
>If that doesn‚Äôt make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, read it again until it does.  
>  
>Steve Grand, *Creation: Life and How to Make It*

The atoms that comprise your body don‚Äôt belong to you ‚Äì they are nomads, and they're just staying with us for a little while.

# After Earth: The long future of your atoms

After another five billion years of cycling around the Earth, all atoms on our planet will be scorched by the Sun as it expands into the final stage of its life, a red giant.

The Sun‚Äôs outer layers will expand until they engulf Mercury, Venus, and finally the Earth. Any life that has not found a way to leave the Earth by this point will be, quite simply, completely cooked.

[The Sun will swell into a red giant, scorching then engulfing the Earth. Credit: James Gitlin](https://preview.redd.it/7sxdt7thf4p51.jpg?width=1751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed2cb3225e174f2ef9914702f86bdd14e5607588)

Eventually like the ancestor stars that preceded it, the Sun will explode, returning new atoms to cold, dark clouds in space. Then the star cycle begins anew.

Hundreds of new stars will form, and your atoms will be split amongst a new set of planets, moons, and maybe new forms of life.

[The Sun will explode into a nebula, like countless stars before it](https://preview.redd.it/ft7xz1d5g4p51.jpg?width=2780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=813554f3af9bca2e80e26cf9e947f34288df5dbb)

Cosmologists believe that this cycle of death and rebirth of the stars will repeat about one hundred times, before the final star in the universe exhausts all the remaining hydrogen and helium, and the galaxies will go dark.

https://i.redd.it/szxewf86g4p51.gif

# The end of the road?

What will follow is an era of black holes. All matter, including your old atoms, will either be consumed by them or flung into deep space by their gravity.

After countless ages, where the time scales are so long that the eras of stars and planets that preceded it begin to look like a momentary blip, even the black holes disappear by evaporating into nothing but radiation.

&#x200B;

[The view from a planet in orbit around a black hole.](https://preview.redd.it/uqid4w27g4p51.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=46ccf5efb5e759659b46061e807783a1a6c55f86)

This is the end of what scientists know will happen for sure.

# Or will it all begin again?

But there is much speculation about what happens next.

One possibility is that, after any surviving atoms and radiation have spent an eternity travelling through the cold, dark remnants of the universe, they will decay into the [quarks](https://bigideas.network/the-standard-model/) that they consist of.

These particles will fill the universe in a ‚Äòthermal equilibrium‚Äô, where every place in the universe is barely above a temperature of absolute zero, and no further exchange of energy becomes possible.

This means no stars, life, or intelligence will be possible. It may remain in this state for all of eternity. This is called the heat death of the universe.

A second, more hopeful possibility is that the expansion of the universe itself slows, and is gradually reversed by the pull of its own gravity.

After hundreds of billions of years, every atom and flash of radiation are brought back together until they rush to collapse into a single point. This is a reversal of the Big Bang, called the ‚ÄòBig Crunch‚Äô.

[In reality, it will be the remaining black holes that are pulled towards a single point, as galaxies have long since disappeared.](https://i.redd.it/56mrgrnbg4p51.gif)

Many scientists believe that the Big Crunch will be the end of our universe, but others think it may be followed by something spectacular.

The Big Crunch may trigger a new Big Bang that creates a whole new universe, which could one day have new stars, new planets, and new life ‚Äì or perhaps something entirely different.

In this distant universe, the energy that once made your atoms may be part of some wonderful form that‚Äôs beyond our imagination.

Or perhaps something that‚Äôs a little familiar. It may form the light of a distant star that touches the retina of a creature who wonders about the universe, and where their own atoms came from.

2020-01-14 11:17:09,Atheist meditator does 5g shrooms (first time) in total silent darkness,"I did the Terence McKenna 5g of mushrooms in TOTAL silent darkness. This was my first time taking anything more intense than MDMA. (I now know, what I did is crazy!) I am a long term meditator and a very stable and calm person. I was inspired by Sam Harris doing ""the 5g"". I thought I had it all figured out. Oh man, how wrong I was...

I didn't do any research on the experience itself. I wanted to experience it and make up my own mind without outside influence. I really didn't know what an ego-death even meant.

I ate the mushrooms, went to a small pitch-black room with a mattress that I had prepared. I also had an audio recording going on the entire time, so I could make fresh notes to remember better what happened. 

The beginning was interesting but very safe. Seeing patterns, merging of the senses and eventually starting to lose different senses altogether. At the time I thought this is cool and felt very confident I was mastering the trip. Oh boy, I really didn't know what was to come...

The trip started to intensive and I was getting sucked to these ""rabbit holes"". Sort of like getting lost in your thoughts but there was no thoughts, only the void, and experience of the said void. At this point, I made the decision to just surrender and accept what was happening as I had read resistance is futile when it comes to shrooms. I was no longer under any illusion that I was mastering the trip. 

This continued to intensive until I reached the peak of the experience. I was losing my ""ego"" one part at a time. I did not realize this at the time. I was too busy being overwhelmed by the changes that were happening to my conscious experience. I had also lost any ability to record and comment. I had started to lose the concepts of speaking and recording. At the peak was a total loss of ego. It really did sneak up on me.

By ""losing my ego"" I mean I lost all my memories, who I was, what even is a human, any sense I have or once had a body, the concept of a body was unknown to me. I had no concept of vision or any other senses, I had no idea what was geometry or even causality. I had no idea there could be other conscious beings. I was a totally plank slate of experience.

Also, there was no feeling of being located in space. What I mean is the feeling we have of being behind our eyes and being a passenger in our body didn't exist. Normally you identify with yourself, but I didn't identify with anything. I just had the experience of being and everything that I experienced was part of me. An analogy would be in normal state: experiencing everything you experience as part of you. The chair, sounds, phone, and other people would be ""you"". And also there was no ""you"" because you have no memories or even basic concept of time. Everything just was.

The void my consciousness encompassed was just that. A void of absolute nothing. A strange indescribable dark void that was everything and one. There was no ""time"". Just ""now"" and there was no concept of something being before. It was eternal.

When I started ""returning"" from this state I started having flashbacks in this void of pure consciousness. Objects like memories sensations and thoughts started to appear. The flashbacks were parts of my past life. The flashbacks did not make any sense because I was missing all the context to interpreted these flashbacks. Try making sense of a memory of my dog when you don't even know what living matter or colors are.

This was the most absolutely terrifying part of the experience. Remember I had no clue that I had eaten mushrooms or what are mushrooms or that I had not always been in this egoless state. The confusion and contrast between the egoless state and the normal were just too much to my normal self. I did not know what I was. Was this a dream? Was my old life a hallucination? Am I a madman making this all up? Am I just a lonely single consciousness in the void that just is?  Am I going to reach some state even higher than this, something unimaginable? Am I going to wake up and wake up to what!?

I started getting more and more of these flashbacks and the fundamental concepts of the normal world like time and geometry started returning part by part. The horror started to wear off when I got closer to normal and I remembered I had done this to myself on this state will pass. And there was a ""me"" again.

The experience was fluctuating, meaning I went back to the egoless state and came back multiple times. It was extremely interesting finding your past life for the first time and getting introduced to the world for the first time in all practical sense of the meaning. I saw my life without any attachment to it and I also saw it as totally worthless, but not in any negative sense of the word. This is because I had no attachments. I could not tell the difference in value between a rock and the whole humankind. The whole idea of getting reattached to my old life was extremely foreign to this state of being I was.

The feeling of ""falling back to my body"" was extremely strange. All my sensations had no location attached to them. My bodyparts were all over the place and I didn't really know what part was what or that they were connected. Also, there were thoughts, images, and sensations of the mattress mixed in. My body concept was like after coming out of a blender.

But I remember when I was a child I had a hard time sleeping and would lie awake in bed forever it seemed. Something I would do is push on my eyeballs and I'd see all kinds of crazy colors and patterns. I wouldn't do it so much that it would hurt or anything, and I can't say anything about the safety or risks of this. I did it as a kid and never said anything about it. But I recall being fascinated by the bright colors and shapes and it looked just like a wild trip. 

I also remembered thinking about how numbers were invented and I saw turquois 4's rolling out of the black void and into people's minds. And I also used to wonder about how shapes were invented and I saw fuchsia triangles just sitting in nature or floating through space.

2021-01-12 16:25:18,900 Micrograms: The last super-dose I will ever drop.,"The following experience happened during the summer.

**Background**

I couple years back I started taking psychedelics again after many, many years away from them. My goal was to work my way up to a super dose. I reached my goal that night.

I didn‚Äôt go into this experience simply trying to reach the goal of having a superdose trip. I was stuck in a rut mentally, and was trying to break free of the chains that were holding me down, and gain a new perspective on life, spirituality, love, family, and as a way to deal with hardships I was suppressing for long periods of time. Some of my experiences are on my profile as trip reports. I quickly elevated my dosages and my experiments.

During the last couple years, I started out low, 20-25 mg of 4-AcO-DMT (Acetylpsilocin) on one night, 200 micrograms another night. Then I did both 200 micrograms + 25 mg of Acetylpsilocin at the same time. After a while after that I moved up to 65 mg of Acetylpsilocin and, eventually up to 75 mg.  Then I mixed 300 micrograms with around 25-30 mg of Acetylpsilocin. I eventually meant to go for 500 mic‚Äôs with 30 mg, but I ran out of psilocin, so instead I dropped 900 micro grams. This was this past summer. 

**Preparation**

As is my standard routine for heavy experiences, I tidied up, had a friend take and hide my car keys, put away all scissors and sharp objects, rolled a few joints, set up a music playlist, and queued up Planet Earth 1 & 2 as a background show.

**Note 1**

I say ‚ÄúMe‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù during the report, but make no mistake, this just me phrasing it after the fact. Make no mistake though, during the experience, there was vast amounts of ‚Äútime‚Äù where those concepts were as foreign and inconceivable to me as truly understanding infinity, or the size of the universe. You understand the concept, but as humans, being a finite species, we don‚Äôt fully comprehend it because we are limited by the rules of distance and time. It‚Äôs only looking back in hindsight, that I am able by apply the idea of ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚ÄúMe‚Äù.

**Experience Report**

At around 8 PM I set 9 tabs under my tongue. It was tricky to do, that‚Äôs a lot of paper. The waiting game began. I didn‚Äôt need to wait long.

Unless you have done this yourself, you will never understand how quickly and hard you come up with that much LSD pumping through your veins. Within the first 35 minutes you‚Äôre already tripping harder than a 350-400 microgram peak. I very quickly stripped all my clothes off, and stretched out in bed, completely nude. It felt right to shed my clothes during that intense experience. I could feel my heart beat and with every ‚Äúthump-thump‚Äù the visuals would increase exponentially, pulsing with the beat of my heart. This gave the growing experience a sense of life that I still to this day cannot find the words to describe. After that time had no meaning, space had no meaning, I can‚Äôt say I had no meaning, because there was no I. I‚Äôve never done DMT, but I‚Äôve read and have had people tell me it‚Äôs much like being blasted from a cosmic canon. This was like that, but not as instant.

Once this unyielding sense of rising faded, I was left bodiless, with no identity, floating in an ever changing landscape of psychedelia. And this is where things got challenging for me, from what I remember. I won‚Äôt say it was bad, because it wasn‚Äôt a nightmare trip like I‚Äôve heard about, but it was definitely challenging for a while.

I felt like I relived (except relived isn‚Äôt exactly right, I was more of a singular floating point of awareness watching these events unfold over and over again, like some depressing movie with each chapter set to repeat numerous times) some of my excruciatingly painful moments of my life, things I had buried inside for decades. If I had to experience it once, it would have been bad enough, but having memory suppression take full effect, it caused these scenes to replay themselves. This was to my benefit, I now believe. The suicides of my best friends, loss of loved ones, my self percieved failures as a person, husband, and father, the root causes for my addictions earlier in life, but I also revisited the best moments of my life. Meeting the woman I love, holding my son for the first time, and proposing to my wife. It gave me a level of closure on the pain and made me realize how tremendously lucky I am, and made me so incredibly grateful for the things I have, that so many others may never get to experience. It also made me realize that I shouldn‚Äôt punish myself for the things I can‚Äôt control. As guilty as I felt about the suicide of my best friend, I realized it wasn‚Äôt my fault, and instead of hating, and beating myself up for what was lost, I need to remember and love what was.

What felt like the god head spoke to me (was it really me, or was it my soul or conciousness that was stripped of all my sense of self) and it kept repeating love all that is around you. Love all that is around you.  I say god head, but I don‚Äôt know what it was or how else to explain it. It was a web of everything that was running in to me and through me with an ever evolving face in the middle.

Then I truely did lose all sense of self. There was no surroundings to feel a part of, no past, no future, no present. Just unimaginably vivid colours, as well as morphing geometric shapes, faces, beings, and alien landscapes all transforming into growing fractal images. This felt like a reward for staying through the challenging portion, and as I was starting to realize, yes, I am a living, breathing person, I was overcome with joy, love, and gratitude for life.

It really was a truely beautiful experience. It was painful, but so rewarding, I finally felt free.

That is all I really remember until I had started to finally come down about 10 hours later, at about 6:30 AM. I finally got dressed and head outside into the morning sun. The trees, the clouds, the sky, the grass, everything was alive with a pure, clean, and loving energy. It was one of those beautiful mornings where the sky has a pink hue to it. The trees danced and swayed, grew taller and shorter, while the bark was a river of flowing texture, colour, and patters. The grass ripples like a lake on the day with a gentle breeze, shining in the most brilliant green you could ever imagine. The clouds drifted, morphed, and changed from pink, to purple, to orange, all in magnificent neon hues. The blue with pink on the horizon looked as if the universe had an artist render the sky and clouds with beautiful pastels. I cried in joy of all that was around me, and all I could see. I tried my best to describe this to you, but I assure you, my words still can‚Äôt paint how beautiful it truly was.

I was steadily coming down now for the next 6 hours

I was tripping for 16 hours, and was in an afterglow for about 3-4 days where everything had this amazing shine to it. It took me around 6 days to understand what had happened to me, and to come to terms with it. I will NEVER do it again, nor will I do high doses again.

**Final Notes**

At that level of dosage, there is no ‚Äúego dissolution‚Äù at all, it‚Äôs more like one second it‚Äôs there and the next it‚Äôs gone. You don‚Äôt have a chance to fight it, and you don‚Äôt have to tell yourself to let go, because by the time it happens, there is nothing left to hold on to.

I don‚Äôt recommend this to ANYONE who isn‚Äôt vastly experienced in heroic doses, and is of the most stable mind that you can be. It would tear the unprepared psychonauts reality to shreds, and you just may never get it back together again.

With all that said, my time since this... experience... has been better than I could ever have thought possible. I have a new found appreciation for all the is in front of me. I love deeper, I forgive people I never could have before, I‚Äôm more balanced in life, and appreciate the things in life we take for granted. Nature, the cool breeze on a warm day, family, and love. I‚Äôve been less egotistical, much more humble, and more open to being wrong about things and learning from my mistakes.

I can‚Äôt explain it. I have always known psychedelics could change your life, and I thought I knew what that meant, but this experience changed me more than I could have ever dreamed. 

**Goodbye and Fairwell**

With that, it brought my psychedelic journey to a close. No longer will I trek every higher into the realm of psychedelia, though I may enjoy the odd medium dose trip now and again.

*EDIT*

I would like to thank you all for your kind words and support! It really fills my heart with joy to see the feedback and appreciation you have all shown towards my experience, healing, and growth.

I hope each and every one of you continues your path to a better state of mind, and has a healthy and prosperous future!

Yours, Immersed In Psychedelia.",53,8795,9,1625,1
2019-11-12 04:02:01,A love letter to a young Psychonaut,"This is a letter I wish my 17 year old self could read  
Dear Psychonaut,

Your mind is an endless fractal of wonder, confusion and awe. Your heart is bigger than you ever could imagined. Your spirit, yes you have a spirit, is interconnected to every other person you meet, every particle of air you breathe and everything in between. Your mind creates the abyss and your heart will be the one that has to cross it. You may have an idea of what these words mean right now as you process them with your eyeballs and internal cognitive processes but it will take some time for you to listen intently to the message within.

Psychedelics are ineffable, mystical, awe inspiring tools, messengers, entities,  that can serve to transform our perception, our connection with ourselves and with nature. They along with the multitude of spiritual, psychological, and philosophical teachings of the world all serve the same purpose. To **trust**.

**Trust** that there are priceless gifts to be harvested from the pain and sorrows that you have been through. **Trust** that you are, will be and always have been surrounded by love. **Trust** that your single lifetime is not the most important one, nor the only one that is happening in the present moment. **Trust** that you will learn to trust yourself over time, it takes practices. **Trust** that you will forget this time and time again.

No human can live in the perfect cosmic bliss truth, and yes you are human.   
You are much more than just human, but you are human, if you deny this you are living in delusion.

Be aware of your limitations, and don't take your clarity of mind for granted. Psychedelics may assist you in conquering your demons but they can alter you in ways that are more subtle than the ways you think. These substances affect the brain just like every other psychoactive out there. Sure LSD is not the same as oxy or cocaine, but it does alter your brain in significant ways, and should not be taken lightly. *While it has helped your mental health it can and will hurt your mental health if you do not treat it with the caution and respect you deserve.* Recreational use is perfectly understandable and even encouraged in small doses, but when going in to explore put some more intention into your psychedelic use, and write down the lessons that came through to you, ask yourself how can I remember these lessons and bring them into my day to day life.

Your body is more connected to your mind and emotions than you ever knew, so get in touch with it. Break the cycle of neglect, don't neglect your body, don't neglect your heart, and maybe ease up a little bit on beating your mind into submission and show some compassion to all parts of your mind, yes even the scary bits. 

Opening yourself to new experiences, to new frontiers of the mind and pushing yourself to your limits is necessary for real growth; at the same time start to figure out where your comfort zone, growth zone and alarm zone is and pay attention. *Casting a wide net means nothing if you don't take a fish from your net and learn to handle it and cook it properly.* 

&#x200B;

You are an oxymoron, learn to accept with the hypocrisy, laugh at the cosmic joke, indulge in the moments, remember to dance and check out of that chaotic mind. This mystery isn't exclusively seen through by you or other psychedelic users, many people realize the wildness of existence and absurdity of human systems. 

All of us are confounded and overwhelmed by this mystery. Some choose to face it and believe their attempts to fit puzzle pieces together in hope for a larger picture of the whole, some people choose to ignore it and believe it's all too overwhelming and futile to even try, and some lucky few never ask the question and live with all they got. 

None of these approaches are better than the other. Show empathy and understanding to those who are too overwhelmed by their existence to even question it, there are often systemic reasons in which others seek to suppress freedom of thought.  Be strong in your conviction and do not half-ass this work.

Acceptance is not complacency. You can accept the absurdity of it all but that doesn't mean you can't do anything about it. Tend to the garden that you can reach and recognize how far you CAN reach. ""The task is not yours to finish but neither are you free to not take part in it"" what impact do you want to make?

You can immerse yourself and be present without that tab or joint, and the sooner you learn to do so the more joy you will find in moments you once thought were dull and routine. Become a factory of joy for yourself and people around you, as **joy acts as the aloe vera to the burns of existence**.

Remember that the words that you are reading through your mind right now are illusory, you are not your mind, you are not your body, or your soul, you are not whatever concept, identity or label that  you or others tell you that you are.

Remember to trust,  
With infinite love, and gratitude for all that you are

As yes the perfect time to announce this was ofcourse.... Easter dinner. As my parents pay for college I felt like it was finally time to tell them about this passion of mine which is psychedelics and how they can help the human mind heal. Let me tell you, my parents are grade A boomers who think all drugs are bad. They told me "" how in the hell can these help people"". I told them I havent been suicidal in months (as I've ended up in countless mental hospitals and in the ICU due to trying to commit suicide). On my own accord in the past month I got myself a trauma therapist for childhood abuse thats been hard to deal with. I also told them about my healing journey and how I feel like I'm becoming the person that I never thought was possible. Trying to love with out fear of rejection and being compassionate and patient with others and myself. Needless to say, they love it. They see how much I've changed and how im improving my own mental health through day to day actions and behaviors. They see the passion i have for wanting to help others and myself. My parents and I have had a rocky road and it was so cool to finally be open and honest with them regarding what I want to do with my career. I felt like they finally saw me, not my mask I put on for every friend group or family member. But the real me who's vulnerable and open and honest.

2019-07-29 22:27:07,Let's talk about taking psychedelics for fun.,"So I was just listening to Alan Watts and my brain was doing it's brain thing and something dawned on me.

As you know, many people in the psychonautic community stress the importance of taking psychedelics for spirituality and self-betterment, while some even frown upon recreational use. 

I want to state that there's nothing wrong with taking them that way. I myself do it.

But hear me out for a second.

So Watts talks about the concept which is often stressed in Eastern philosophy of ""letting go"" and not trying to force and control things, right? Trusting the Universe and yourself to do it's thing naturally.

Now ask yourself, why do you really want to be enlightened? Why do you want spiritual insight? What's your motive behind it?

Is it because you're unhappy? Do you want to change your circumstances? Do you think that once you reach enlightenment, once you get that special thing you desperately are looking for, then you will finally be happy? *Then* things will *finally* be okay? Then, you can finally relax.

Don't you see how that is a form of trying to control? The reason you want enlightenment is the reason you're not. You haven't surrendered.

By convincing yourself that your salvation lies in something you have yet to *find*, you automatically take it away from yourself. This is the game the ego plays. 

Now, let me just state that *there's nothing necessarily wrong with that either*

But can you see where I'm trying to get at here?

Stop trying to get a grip on the Universe. Stop trying to figure it out. Let go. Surrender to the mysterious. Just say to yourself **I don't know**. It feels good. Revel in the mystery. Let it be the way it is.

So with that being said, what's wrong with taking psychedelics, simply because you want to have fun? Just because? Not for any alternative motive, not to try and get something out of it, but just for the experience itself? We do this with everything else. We listen to songs just because we like the way they sound. We eat foods because we like the way they taste. We play games because we like playing games.

 And if you happen to get some spiritual insight in the process, then that's simply a bonus. But don't try to force it. Don't go into the experience with any expectations. It's funny because now that I think about it, my most profound moments came on their own, when I wasn't looking for them. They just came to me.

Let's discuss. What do you think?",45,2442,7,435,1
2021-10-14 13:02:37,Been doing a lot of contemplating recently. And it dawned on me that this earth that we live on could literally be heaven on earth if we just had a different system. We have enough resources and technology now for a decent quality of life for everyone and every sentient being on this great planet.,"I‚Äôd say 80% of the terrible things that happen on this planet (poverty, corruption, feeling separate from nature, egos, war) can be deduced to greed for money, which is this construct we have created. It isn‚Äôt gold it‚Äôs fiat currency and capitalism is the great machine which rewards people with this thing that we have all agreed is worth something, money. Don‚Äôt get me wrong capitalism is the best system we have at the minute as it rewards creative entrepreneurs who create value and services to people, it‚Äôs what they get rewarded with, money, that is the problem. We need something to replace money while at the same time rewarding people for hard work. 

Because think about it for example poverty which causes so much crime, sadness and desperation is because people don‚Äôt have enough money, not because we don‚Äôt as a planet have the resources to give them a good quality of life. I‚Äôm not saying give people stuff for nothing similar to communism I‚Äôm saying we need to think of a new system that has the same output and freedom of capitalism in terms of great creativity/products/services but without money (very difficult I know!) our whole infrastructure is built around doing things for money this is a curse and a blessing as it encourages productivity but also we base our whole societies on who has the most money, which is a purely constructed thing of human minds. It‚Äôs all a game, but we can change the rules if we tried. 

I hope this makes sense and other people get what I‚Äôm trying to say here. I‚Äôm not saying people should get stuff for nothing, I‚Äôm also not a fan of communism where wealth is distributed as that will not encourage entrepreneurs, I‚Äôm talking about taking all of the positives of capitalism but getting rid of money, which when you think about it is the root cause of a lot of evil on this wonderful planet. We have the natural resources, knowledge and technology to make this a place of love and enlightenment but it‚Äôs a huge reconstruction but I think we are clever enough to do it.",298,2021,55,359,1

I updated this and included images on a blog post version. Thank you to all that have read and have commented. Please feel free to reach out with any questions \*\*

Hi everyone, I want to share how psychedelics have helped my well-being. It's a journey that spans about five years. It starts with LSD and touches Ayahuasca, DMT, 5-Meo-DMT, and Mushrooms. It's a bit wordy and repetitive, but instead of saving it on my desktop, I figured I'd share.

I hope it does not come off as trauma processing each time. I've had a ton of fun and growth with this journey. I'm excited about future experiences!

## Background:

I do want to start with some background information. I'm 28 years old, and I'm from Chicago. I'm a first-generation American, with my family originating from Zacatecas, Mexico. I grew up with my grandparents and did not have my biological parents present in my childhood. I suffered from severe depression and anxiety throughout my life. I only became aware of this at the age of 19. I spent time at psychiatric hospitals and was on and off medications. I also considered myself lacking in social skills. I found it very difficult to make friends and even socialize in ordinary settings.

## LSD

**October 2016 - September 2019Quantity: 80 tabs spread throughout yearsDoses: 100¬µg to 1,000¬µg**

**October 2016**

So my search for psychedelics starts with some suicidal ideation. I was living alone in the suburbs of Chicago and working a retail job. I had spent the last year in a deep depression and confused with romantic relationships. I was depressed and hopeless. I was desperate for some relief from my depression. I recalled reading articles on how psychedelics help with depression and anxiety. In a moment of desperation, I sought out LSD and bought two batches equaling a total of 80 tabs.

My first experience was at one of the lowest points of my life. Upon taking it, I experienced a sense of clarity and euphoria. For the first time in my life, I felt self-worth and love for myself. I remember the LSD kicking in and shortly after going towards my bathroom mirror. It was as if I was seeing myself for the very first time, wholly astonished with my being. I had never had this sense of compassion and appreciation for myself. It dissolved those thoughts of suicide. The newfound state of mind inspired me to keep going.

That first trip was life-changing. But, I made the mistake of not practicing integration, only using journaling and inconsistent meditation. I spent a couple of months trying to replicate that first trip. My experiences were rocky, between euphoria and discomfort. In a nutshell, I was a little reckless with it.

**November 2016-November 2018**

Shortly after my first experiences with LSD, I had my first romantic relationship at 23 or 24. I was insecure and had an unhealthy attachment. I ended up in the mental hospital at one point. When that relationship ended, I was destroyed and caught in rumination. I began to use LSD to escape and make sense of my breakup. I took my heaviest dose of 10 tabs and had a breakdown. I had been keeping my issues to myself. During this breakdown, I finally opened up to my family, and I was able to get some help. My use became more spaced out.

**December 2018**

After two years, I entered a new romantic relationship. But I was still trapped in an unhealthy attachment style. My tobacco addiction continued, and I was now at a point where I was smoking a pack and a half of cigarettes a day. Also, I was smoking weed daily throughout the day and avoiding life outside of work. I spent most of my days driving aimlessly from the moment I got out of work until strange hours of the night.

**September 2019**

A year passed in this mental state; then, I took my final LSD tab. I now realized that I had to end my addictions. To instead, explore venues that would be fulfilling. My tobacco addiction stopped. I learned that material items are replaceable. Also, that my restless and anxious mind needs stimulation by regular change.

**December 2019**

My apartment lease was ending. I decided to do something brave and a little irrational and even strange. I decided to donate all my belongings and only keep what fits inside a backpack. I decided to explore the city of Chicago. But through backpacking around a different neighborhood each week.

**January 2020**

I ventured the South, West, and North sides of Chicago using weekly short-term rentals. I continued this way of life for a few months, but it came to a halt due to the pandemic.

I was completely caught off guard, like the majority of people. Being inside a building in a cramped City, with the direction of not going out, was not easy. I switched from weekly rentals to monthly, with my final one ending in July. It was a ton of fun while it lasted. I kept a full-time job, and I volunteered as a tutor after work. I did a lot of biking during my time in Chicago.

**July 2020**

I decided to move to Zacatecas, Mexico. Digital nomads inspired me. I had never been to the city and did not know anyone, but I felt brave. I did have experiences visiting a rural town in the state in my childhood, so that helped. I ended my relationship due to distance. I knew immediately after landing that I did not plan to go back to the United States. It was one of the most complex decisions I've made.

I met a group of archaeologists at a pizza shop the day after landing in Mexico. They invited me to gather peyote from the desert. I ended up not following through with the offer. I thought it was a bit unethical, and my social awkwardness got in the way. But, it showed me how open people are with psychedelics in Mexico. It was not uncommon for people to view these substances as medicines.

**September 2020**

After about a year of not using LSD, I made a new friend who shared a few tabs. I got to explore LSD in this beautiful historical city and rural areas covered in cacti.

I fell in love with the city. I wanted to dive into it, but I was still working remotely as an Account Executive for a company out in Chicago. My role became such high pressure as I was working with some of our customer's pandemic responses. I realized that my job was replaceable and that I needed a break to recover from my burnout. I was miserable at work, and it was cutting into my free time.

I had the happiest days after quitting that job. I explored fields and even areas with natural hot springs. I spent nights stargazing in areas with little light pollution. I also spent months in the small town of Valparaiso, Zacatecas. It was the birthplace of my grandparents, so it was unique to experience.

# Ayahuasca and DMT

**October 2020Dose: 6 shots of Ayahuasca and 2 hits of Changa.Frequency: Once**

I was searching for some transition into this new jobless period. I came across a group that hosts Ayahuasca ceremonies with a local shaman. The shaman was from the Wix√°rika/Huichol indigenous community. I had a difficult time connecting with the medicine. The shaman invited me to smoke Changa, a blend of herbs containing DMT and an MAOI. The effects were immediate, and I resisted for a moment; this was my first DMT experience. After a few seconds, I relaxed and let go, and it allowed me to merge with the earth and icaros fully.

I was expecting to see a bunch of people in their 20s at this ceremony. It was my ignorance of having expectations of a psychedelic user's appearance. The group was primarily middle-aged professionals and a few young people. I even saw some families go together. The strangest thing was seeing a 13-14-year-old girl from the Wix√°rika community take part. She had recently lost her mother. She was weeping and closed off during the initial part of the ceremony. Midway, she was counseling the middle-aged people and assisting in the ceremony.

My Ayahuasca session was beautiful, and it taught me so much in such a short time. My friend who shared LSD with me also attended the same ceremony. He also claimed that it had a healing impact on him.

I had no intention of being in any romantic relationship. I thought of myself as too damaged. I felt I had to be responsible and stay solo until being healthier. But, I had a breakthrough that taught me that I don't have to be perfect to form relationships. I ended with a deeper connection to earth and appreciation for my life and background. I had a nice glow for several weeks.

**December 2020**

After that ceremony, my friend became my partner. I also picked up new projects and began to socialize without my barrier of awkwardness. The last week of December 2020, I was looking at my bank account. I realized that I had to get a job soon to avoid any deep financial trouble. My partner lost his job due to the pandemic and a toll on the company's finances. I decided to move to Tijuana and use the proximity to San Diego to search for a new job.

My partner agreed to go with me as he also saw more economic opportunities in Baja California. We hopped on a plane on New Year's Eve and landed in Tijuana. I will admit that the transition was not as easy as I thought. Finding a job was quite a challenge. I burned through my savings. I had the embarrassing task of asking my family for help. Now keep in mind that I am not someone who asks for help. I am used to living solo and handling my issues on my own. My family was happy to help, and they thought that I was making the right choice by exploring this new territory. They were supportive of my experience with Ayahuasca.

# Mushrooms

**February 2021Dose: 0.20gramsFrequency: An eight spread throughout two months.**

Weak finances and no job was discouraging, and it pushed me into another state of depression. Job searching and interviewing seemed impossible. I was even bedridden and struggled to function for a month or two. I saught out the mushroom, as I heard that it grew out here. I was especially fascinated by the microdose. I obtained some, and I was able to nibble a piece every couple of days. Those nibbles gave me the energy to interview and finally get a new job. The job is in a new field and with a higher salary than my previous one. I did not get to experience a standard dose since finances were tight.

# 5-Meo-DMT

**May 2021Frequency: Once**

After working for a couple of months, I stabilized and found a new apartment. I now had the funds and well-being to explore psychedelics further. I followed my fascination with Bufo Alvarius, the Sonoran Desert toad. I came across a facilitator and scheduled a session. I went to my bufo session expecting something like my LSD or Ayahuasca/DMT experiences. There was no comparison. Upon inhaling, I was transported into eternal light and heard an Om sound. I had no visuals. I experienced the feeling of complete inner peace. It showed me what life could be without any worry. It gave me grounding that I have been able to carry to this present day. I don't mean to say it's vivid but recollecting it in my mind is not too difficult.

# Mushrooms

**Doses: 2.00-6.00 gramsFrequency: At least two times per monthMay 2021 - Present**

Funny enough, I met a mycologist, and I have been able to buy various types of mushrooms at a great price. I sampled a 2.5 g trip with the Mazatepac mushroom the day after my bufo experience. The 5-Meo experience cleared my mind so well that this lighter mushroom dose had a significant impact.

I saw all the influence culture had on me, especially school, work, friends, family, and society. It gave me a few hard pills to swallow. I had a rough week or two after this experience as it was hard to integrate back into life. I felt like I was living a lie. After almost a year of being away from Chicago, I made a trip back. It was rejuvenating to see my family and friends. It helped me integrate what I had learned.

When I returned home to Tijuana, I continued my relationship with the mushroom. Wow, I cannot give enough credit to how the mushroom has helped me. It is as if my depression and anxiety have vanished. I am almost unrecognizable to myself. The person I once was in Chicago, who saw themselves tied by circumstance, is not here.

I have immense gratitude and a deeper connection with the present moment. I've even picked up some creative projects. I've been able to focus on my physical health, and I've lost weight.

My attention and my focus are no longer an issue. I'm able to dedicate some time toward some hobbies and different outputs. I was diagnosed with ADHD in the U.S. and took Adderall to function for a few years. Adderall is not prescribed in Mexico, and I have not used any psychiatric medication for over a year. I don't identify with the ADHD or other diagnoses I received.

I continue my mushroom use as needed with a frequency of at least two times a month. My finances are getting back in shape. I got offered a promotion at work after three months but declined it. I'm in a happy and healthy relationship. My communication has also improved!

# Overview:

I started taking LSD to help me with my depression. The journey was rocky, and I got a bit sloppy. I used my teachings to practice minimalism and became a temporary nomad. I ended up moving to Mexico. I got introduced to more psychedelics. The introduction to shamanism opened my eyes to the potential of these substances. I've been able to untangle my depression, anxiety, fears, and addictions. I've also used it to understand myself and others better. My recent voyages with Ayahuasca, 5-Meo, and Mushrooms have been game-changers.

The world is a much friendlier place than what the media portrays it as. Different ways of life are possible, and you're not limited to your current situation.

If your work with psychedelics is helping you, please continue! I wish you courage and self-compassion as you progress through your journey. Thank you so much for reading this! I appreciate being able to share this as there are few psychonauts in my immediate circle. If you have any questions or would like to share comments, please do so!",87,14080,16,2511,1
2021-05-10 16:35:05,I feel like I've done too many psychedelics in my life and my perception is irreversibly changed for the worse.,"Ignorance is bliss. I had no idea how true this was, until I started taking psychedelics years ago and it felt like with every trip, the cracks in our society and how we live got a little bigger and harder to miss. 

I view everything as a waste of time now, so I enjoy nothing. I see all these people who think they have a direction in their life, but it's meaningless once their lights go out and they're forgotten. 

Whats the point of any of this?

I have a career, so I can pay my mortgage, so I can own a house, so I can have somewhere for my family to live, so we can all participate in this life that someone else laid out the rules for and we can enjoy things we're told to enjoy when we're not working the majority of our lives. 

I don't view anything as real. Even though it's possible that this is the only thing that is real. Or is this the illusion and we'll find the true life when we die?

These are the kind of thoughts I never had when I was ignorant and just another rat running on my wheel and I miss it. I wish I could go back to when promotions, people's opinions of me, material wealth, and life experiences mattered to me. I feel like I'm and actor now, and I put on an external show for everyone around me, but on the inside I've given up all of that. It wasn't a conscious choice, I don't think, just a natural development of my mind through psychedelics.

2020-08-12 19:45:28,"Ketamine, Near-Death Experience, and the Existence of a Holographic Universe","I've recently been deep diving through meditation with the assistance of Ketamine and I have begun to experience incredible meditative states that mirror descriptions of Near Death Experiences (NDEs). I recently read a study that was done on sheep given intravenous ketamine. They measured the sheeps' brain activity and realized that at the point of K hole, all brain waves completely ceased. No brain wave activity was evident whatsoever. Within time as they came out of the K hole, miraculously the brain waves would eventually resume. ( [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200611094127.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200611094127.htm)). This got me thinking. In an amazing talk by a neuroscientist who experienced a profound otherworldly experience while brain dead from bacterial menengitis, he discussed that in the absence of brain activity, his consciousness traveled to other worlds in a way that defies all modern understanding of neuroscience. ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbkgj5J91hE&list=WL&index=2&t=5201s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbkgj5J91hE&list=WL&index=2&t=5201s) ) Modern neuroscience believes (falsely) that when our brain waves cease, our ability to perceive reality also ceases. Both in the case of K hole and in near death experiences, it becomes clear that consciousness continues even without the physical brain functioning.

Tying these two concepts together, I realized that when in a K-hole, the otherworldly experiences that we have are directly related to the traveling that our mind does when we die. Quantum physicists talk about their being a ""holographic universe."" I am still working to wrap my mind around this concept, but I will try to explain it as I see it. Modern understandings of reality lead us to believe that there is an objective, concrete reality, filled with ""matter."" However, the smaller we zoom into this matter, we find that at the base there is nothing of substance at the core, but rather a series of relationships between energy and vibrations. What gives these relationships the illusion of substance, is a consciousness perceiving this energy and and forming a holographic image of those relationships. So this is not to say that the material world isn't ""real,"" but just that the idea that it is a fixed, concrete world made of unchangeable objects is a misguided over-simplification of the nature of reality.

When we suspend the functioning of our physical brain waves by means of meditation, death, or substance use, we continue to experience the same set of energetic relationships surrounding us, but it ways and through worlds very different from our day-to-day world we live in. I find this a really profound realization, because it makes clear that consciousness extends beyond our living brain functioning. And even while our brain is still functioning, there are ways by which we can radically shift the way our perception of the world occurs. Anyone who has been deep within a k-hole understands what I mean by this. Those worlds we visit and the experiences we have on k holes often feel ""realer than real,"" and I believe it is because it is opening our eyes to the ability of consciousness to transcend beyond the confines of our usual perceptions of reality. What are sometimes considered hallucinations or written off as meaningless drug induced visions, are actually our brain tapping into entirely different ways to perceive the energetic relationships around us, and to broadcast an entirely different hologram of reality. All of which is equally real, if not even superior in its realness.

If anyone has any thoughts or personal experiences with this I'd love to hear them.",76,3697,10,565,1
2021-06-07 22:20:51,Shrooms changed my entire life in 2020,"I'll keep this shorter than it could be- feel free to ask questions. 

In late 2019, I became obsessed with finding shrooms to take. I was looking for an escape from my unsatisfying life and for some reason shrooms kept coming to mind. 

About me: in 2019 I was a year in to living in my first house with my wife. We had moved to NC after I was fired from a sales job in California. I was a recently separated Navy veteran with a newly earned bachelor's degree and no direction in life. I attached my identity to my career and a sort of edgy gym rat appearance (like many veterans). I was the kind of guy who would say ""I don't care what I do as long as I'm making $$$$$$$."" I also had a tough time being social with anyone I wasn't familiar with. I didn't talk to many strangers and had even moved to one of my childhood cities after the navy to be around long time friends. I was known to not speak much, especially while around more than 1 person.

I was miserable with my new house and job in NC. We were 1 year into our new life and I was already making plans for another escape. Every time I seemed to be unhappy or run into problems, I would simply move somewhere else. Escaping was my go to move instead of facing my problems. My wife ended up making an ultimatum between staying with her in our new house or divorce. I loved her too much and decided I would try to stay.

After finally finding shrooms online, I started tripping. Every 2 to 3 weeks I would do a big trip on the weekend. As my trip count added up, the lessons I started learning became more and more profound. I started to see a different perspective on every detail of my being. 

I learned that I barely interacted with people because of a defense mechanism I set in place when I was young. I feared being rejected. I had grown so accustomed to this, that I had built some sort of identity around it. When I was in college as 25 year old, I would do my best not to talk with any classmates or even the teacher if I could help it. My roommates would throw parties and I would quickly walk to my room and do my best not to make eye contact with anyone. 

I learned that I lacked empathy. I never actually felt bad for anyone who was going through a bad time. I knew how to act a little like it and give advice, but I never really felt anything. 

I learned that hapiness was a decision. I used to think hapiness depended on favorable circumstances and money falling into place. I never knew I could simply choose to be happy.

I learned so much more.

Fast forward to today- I'm the owner of a coffee shop with my first baby boy on the way. I went from someone who didn't make a single friend in 5 years to opening one of the most social businesses I can think of. I'm overwhelmed with how many people know my name and will contact me without my prompting. I'm happy 99% of every day now. I talk to random strangers all the time. I get compliments on my energy and vibes daily.",38,2952,7,575,1

If she can somehow read this I want her and the universe to know that I forgive and love her, and that I'm glad she's not suffering any longer. May peace be forever with her.

2013-12-04 17:34:07,Does anyone else feel that after psychedelics television (especially commercials) seems very sinister?,"I feel like after expanding my mind whenever i do go back to television and see commercials there is something incredibly eerie about it. Namely the fact that it is designed to literally brainwash us not just into buying products, but also constantly being barraged with images of perfect looking people and perfect lifestyles, whether its intentional or not makes the watcher feel like a loser and drains there self esteem.

What really disturbs me even more is i used to be somewhat of a television junkie watching tv for incredibly long periods of time. It didn't help that i only had a few friends and the only way i could learn about the world through television, which made me insecure about not being so lucky with relationships, clinging to this fantasy of being some kind of ladies man. I think going to college was a big eye opener and realizing that fantasy was not only a lie but something i should have never idolized in the first place. What i thought was cool and glamorous was actually dark, hollow, and empty. I look at some of these commercials now and can see how these are used to exploit our deepest fears, worries, and insecurities making them worse so someone can sell a product. I understand some products need exposure to sell and people need to make money, but they shouldn't have to mess with our heads and psychologically assault us in order to get it.

TV distorts and warps our perception of reality in a lot of ways, and i know this because i was once one of its victims.  i used to watch it for the sake of watching it just to fill time, it really is a drug and i get sick thinking of all the crap my mind consumed in the past. I guess the reason people get addicted is not all of us have a lot of social interaction and hearing people talk on a box fills that void, which is when the advertisers try to prey on us.

2021-01-17 16:39:36,Being a nerd is the key to happiness,"Something that mushrooms taught me is that the key to an enjoyable, happy life is gratitude. Appreciation for the things around you (and within you) is the thing that separates a happy person from most people.  

When you have your entire reality shattered and flushed away during an intense trip, I find myself bursting with gratitude for every single detail of this reality. Instead of passive existence, the mushroom gave me an active, interested ‚Äúzest for life‚Äù, as cliche as that sounds.  

For me, the best way to gain appreciation for things is to learn more about them, refine techniques, and just be a nerd about things. Finding all those little details that most people take for granted, and then digging deeper.

For example, I started hiking recently, and I‚Äôve also been trying to learn about the plant life around my area. Knowing what plants are as I pass them, knowing the specific mountain ranges in my area, and all of those details make the experience so much more interesting and enriching for me.  

Another example for me is coffee. Coffee used to simply be bitter caffeine, a way to get me from tired to awake. Once I started learning about the variables I can tweak to make GOOD coffee (brew method, grind consistency, water temperature, using a scale for precise measurements, etc), my morning coffee became an incredibly fun ritual, where I can taste the fruit of my efforts, and it has become a great motivator for starting the day.  

So if you feel like life has become dull, or depressing, or whatever, dig deep into the knowledge and community surrounding things you already do. Maybe even pick up a new hobby! Being a nerd about everything you do will make everything you do feel important, fulfilling, and it will make you more grateful about the things you take for granted.",36,1807,8,312,1
2020-07-24 18:36:23,I finally saw the true beauty of LSD,"I had done acid three times before -- each time, I just took one tab. However, one tab doesn't really do a whole lot for me, so I would end up smoking weed to spice it up a bit. I enjoyed these trips, although they were always a bit of a mixed bag. The weed would always add this haziness and confusion to the trip that over time I realized I did not really like.

So this time, I decided to take two tabs and not smoke, and oh my god, it was life changing. I recorded a little album in my friends garage and I had such a blast. Terrence McKenna once said one the best things you can do while tripping is sing, and man he was right. Making music just felt so primal and so pure. I would just spontaneously come up with these neat little musical ideas and it was so satisfying to get them on tape. 

Then, later in the trip, things got a bit more introspective. I got to thinking about my own self loathing and it made me realize how messed up and sad it is to feel that way about yourself. I realized that there is never a valid reason to hate yourself and any justification for it is just mental gymnastics. We're all just little creatures working with what we got and that's cool. This trip just gave me a new appreciation for life and for that I will be forever grateful. I'm going to try to take better care of myself and be more forgiving towards myself. I now have a better understanding of how special this little chemical is.",36,1433,8,280,1

2021-06-03 01:54:04,I gave money to a homeless lady while peaking on LSD,"I played hooky to drop acid and visit the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Once I started peaking, my friends and I called an Uber to take a scenic route from the city. I wanted to see vibrant, translucent rainbows on buildings. So I rolled down the window. I didn‚Äôt put on my headphones because New York is slowly repopulating again. I wanted to listen to excerpts of layered conversations, other cars, and the wind blow past my face. We didn‚Äôt travel far at all when we hit a stoplight. I watched an old, feeble black woman approach my window and asked if any of us had some spare change. I recognized her, she likes to pet my dog when we see her. I reached into my pocket and realized I only had a $20 bill, so I just handed it to her. Almost absentmindedly. When she looked into her palm, I heard a small gasp. I looked back up to see eyes filled with tears staring straight into me. She proceeded to tell me that she was going to put this money to good use, how she was going to buy her favorite whole wheat bread & meat because she hasn‚Äôt had much money in the past few days. Maybe I was misreading her tone, but it seemed as if she was trying to reassure me that my money was going towards somewhere useful. As the light turned green and the car started to move, I tried to tell her ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt owe anyone an explanation for just trying to survive‚Äù. I doubt she heard me. 

At the garden, I listened to Arvo Part as I was being hypnotized by a sea of trees and rose bushes. The wind moving through them portrayed neon green waves with pink & chrome fractals. On the breathing grass, grey clouds rippled in the sky and Peter Gregson made me feel so alive. There were fluffy bees and ducklings that reminded me of my dog. ‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre so precious and round‚Äù I said multiple times. Although a mischievous day in a beautiful garden was something like a Ferris Beuller, I was a little haunted by sadness the entire time. I felt really lucky and privileged to be where I was. I kept thinking about the luxuries in my life when so many people don‚Äôt even have their basic needs met. As a retired drug dealer, I know my participation in that scene has hurt people for my benefit. I remember thinking ‚ÄúLife is unfair, and somehow I am undeservingly lucky.‚Äù I still carry a lot of guilt around that area of my life and have a hard time forgiving myself. 

Anyways, I made it back home and broke down in the bath tub. I didn‚Äôt know how to process my thoughts and feelings. I didn‚Äôt really talk to anyone about it until my therapy session. After doing some research and talking to my therapist, I have decided to set aside more of my free time to do volunteer work.

2021-12-11 12:34:31,"Please stop with the fucking ""NPC"" shit","Edit #2: I did not /originally/ pick up this idea from the Joe Rogan Blair White interview. Actually, what compelled me to write this was somebody's comments in another post (I can't remember if it was in r/spirituality, r/soulnexus, or this subreddit). In the comment, somebody was talking down on a friend of their's, saying that they had to be an ""NPC"" because their mind wasn't blown by a psychedelic trip. I had already been thinking about the topic for a while, but that person's comment incensed me to the point of having to share my thought on the matter to the whole community. 

Edit: Just thought of a great analogy for what I'm trying to say. It's as if you were a full grown, or even a halfway grown tree, and you saw some saplings still close to the forest floor. It would be ridiculous and hypocritical for the full grown trees to say to the saplings ""Bro, you don't have all your branches yet, wtf man. You must not even be a real tree."" It's like, no dude, most of us start of small, and in various states of confusion. I'll bet you looked a lot like an ""NPC"" during some time in your life. 

You have no right to denigrate another human being by claiming they don't have a soul just because they are on a different part of their journey than you. You know what looks like this so called ""NPC"" behavior? People with social issues. People with anhedonia due to depression. People exhibiting ""flat affect"" due to schizophrenia, which isn't that well understood to begin with. These are people with real lives, real experiences, and have just as much license to a ""soul"" as you do! Also, if someone has an underwhelming response to a drug, it may because they are already operating at a HIGHER frequency than you. If the experience didn't affect them that much, that means they didn't get as much new information, which could easily imply that the doors of their perception are already more open than usual. This doesn't have to be the only explanation of course. They could simply be metabolizing the drug in a different way than you. Or, they could be subconsciously fighting against the effect of the drug, which I suspect happens to many people who say, ""nothing happened, but my body felt like it was on fire""! They are resisting the effects very strongly because their minds are subconsciously trying to keep them within the paradigm of thought-experience that they have been raised to believe. 

I'm mad because it feels like the ""you're an NPC"" crowd are openly disrespecting people that are different than them without any evidence, and more importantly, without any fucking compassion. 

I'm not saying it's impossible that something like an ""NPC"" exists. We can discuss the topic if you are still convinced it's real. Just don't go throwing stones at people that may be completely normal, but are just struggling with their own lives like EVERYBODY else.

2018-05-28 17:23:03,Old hippy saved me when I took too much,"Usually I can take a tab and do what ever I want.  I like to longboard at the beach and stuff like that usually.  Which is what I was doing.  I decided to go find some isolation bc it was coming on VERY strong in 30 mins.  

So I get down to the quite residential area and a mom and her 2 underage daughters say I look cute and started following me around. I was not doing well.  I was drenched in sweat, was forgetting what was going on, visuals were nauseating, and the girls and her mom kept following me pestering me.  I managed to cut a corner and find some isolation until a couple came and sat down next to me at the beach.  Nobody around and they sat next to me.  So I left and decided I wanted to sit on a parking garage.  

At this point the setting around me is completely dominating my thoughts. The street lights didn't come on and it was pitch black, never seen it like this.  I couldn't here anything, felt like everyone was trying to be quite.  Felt like the power was off in the city bc most hotel and store lights were off.  People kept walking away from the beach.  Fire truck after fire truck was screaming by.  I almost ran and asked someone WTF was going on and where the bunker was.  Thought we were under attack from the sea.  I snapped out of that dangerous thought loop and realized I needed to get the fuck inside away from people, reality was collapsing and I was not doing well.  

Made my way to this hippy music shop.  They play live music.  I sat down and there was a dude rapping from the islands.  It was so deep.  I'd sat down right when they were closing.  They could clearly see how fucked up and scared I was. Nobody said anything but they closed the gate so nobody else could see the music and told some others to leave.  A old as hippy looked at me and got on stage.   Said he was tired from going all night but he'd play a few more.  Dude played ""Can't you see"" - Marshall Tucker Band. 

 I started swirling out of reality.  He was playing the song looking at me the whole time.  I heard voices saying ""what are you running from"" and the wind felt like it picked up, felt like I was about to fucking explode, i was dissapating in the air, I was melting in my.seat.  I felt a cacoon of energy surrounding me.  I could feel my eyes rolling in the back of my head.  Pure euphoria I teared up.  I could feel my soul coming out and meeting his.  We would twist and spiral together, weaving into an infinity of shapes and patterns.  Then spiral back into my chair.  Then do it again.  Shit was fucking crazy.  He played a few songs and by that time I could speak again and calmed me down. Felt like I dropped 10k pounds. I can't explain it but it was the best experience of my life.

But the fact remains that you need to be happy about *you* before you care that other people are happy about you. Because if you only work to please others, you lose your own identity in the process.

I struggled with this for a while. I was so caught up in the fact that I wanted people to get the right impression of me that I would go to great lengths to make sure they saw the ""good"" side of me. 

But there is no ""good"" side to show if you're not confident to show your only side. Yourself. All those people saw of me was that I was insecure and worried that they would think I was weird. Which is exactly what I didn't want to happen.

Anybody who makes the choice to judge you based on one or two impressions they have of you isn't worth pleasing anyway. Why give them the time of day if they don't give you theirs? Be yourself. That's how you get true friends and find real happiness.

The substance and meaning of the material world bursts back by way of supernova.... Oh yes, coffee. I put the kettle on.... 
Suddenly my wife's voice brings me back. I had gone away again. 'Coffee' she says, so i put the kettle on. Realising i had done this several times, somewhere deep down i had the intuition that there was more to it than the kettle - MUG. So triumphantly, i walk towards the cupboard with the mugs, take one out, and get lost again on the journey back to the kettle. My wife's voice calls me back like a sirens song. She was conversing normally, i am aware she is trying to pull me back due to her own fear of mushrooms after a bad experience years ago. Not sure how to proceed with conversation, i attempt some sort of response. It rings hollow in my ears. She deserves more. My inability to properly communicate hits home with far reaching implications into my sober life. 
Coffee, i remember. This being my sole mission in life. Im going to do it, for her and for me. Teaspoon, coffee jar, milk. Im on a roll. All i need now is... is... is... 
I have disappeared into colourful shapes, prodding my soul, chanting, until my fears have been smoothed, leaving me in ecstatic euphoria. My hand reappears in waves of sensation along with a purpose - coffee. I have to boil the kettle again, but its OK, im gonna do this. Water into mug, milk, sugar. The sound of stirring looks like fireworks and fairy dust. 
I bring the coffee to my wife, set it gently in her hands and feel the universe smiling at me. ",43,2137,8,389,1

2020-11-17 14:44:51,Yale Manual for Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy : Advice for 'Difficult experiences',"This manual is full of gold for anyone looking to learn about the clinical trials:

http://uczesieact.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Yale-Psilocybin-Depression-Therapy-Manual_Oct-2019.pdf

The following is what the participants are told about 'Common' and 'Difficult experiences', I've found it useful;

**Common experiences with psilocybin**

‚óè Psilocybin is a ‚Äúclassical‚Äù hallucinogen that can cause profound changes in
sensation, perception, thought processes, emotions, the experience of time,
the nature of reality and of the self. The effects may range from very mild to
very strong.

‚óè Perception: you may experience visual distortions or illusions, strong visual
imagery and rarely true hallucinations. Generally towards the beginning of a
session, you may experience cascading geometric forms and colors.

‚óè You may see things from a radically different perspective. For instance, you
may find yourself in a different reality, as if you had lived or are living in
another time or place. You may even feel you are ceasing to exist, going
crazy, or are becoming an animal, plant or other organism. Such changes
may feel confusing or disturbing at times, but may also contribute to strong
spiritual or mystical/transcendent experiences.

‚óè It may help you make significant positive changes in your life, but it is not a
magic cure for anything. For instance you may have psychological insights
about yourself or others.

‚óè We encourage you to take an attitude of curiosity and acceptance toward
whatever happens during your session. Whatever comes up has some kind
of meaning or innate wisdom that you can learn from. However, this meaning
may not be immediately obvious. It is not uncommon to feel as though your
thoughts and perceptions are coming more swiftly than you can process
them. Fully allowing all your emotions and perceptions, good and bad, is
what we hope for, whatever memories, images or body sensations arise.
Accepting and feeling this is, strangely, the path toward being able to do
something about deep-seated patterns of fear, powerlessness, guilt, and
shame.

**Ski slope metaphor:**

‚óè Thinking over and over again is like skiing down a mountain - once you go down one
way you are more likely to go down that way again. In depression, people often ski
down well established ruts. Psilocybin is like a new coating of snow on the
mountain, so that there is much more freedom to ski anywhere (a greater ability to 
28
think freely and tolerate a broader range of emotions). The psilocybin can be seen
as helping you find different paths down the mountain.

**Difficult experiences**

‚óè This medicine may cause physically or emotionally uncomfortable periods

‚óè Physically, you may experience periods of nausea, chills, anxiety, or panic.
Your blood pressure may become somewhat elevated, but we will be
monitoring this. Remember that although the psychological effects may be
extreme, the physiological risks of this medicine are extremely low.

‚óè You may have bizarre sensations and experiences or there may be very
frightening images or thoughts. These may alternate rapidly. This is normal
and does not mean anything is wrong. The effects are time-limited and
present no major risks to the body. It is best to embrace these experiences
as they occur and seek to learn from them.

‚óè It is best to ‚Äúgo with‚Äù or surrender to difficult experiences rather than fight
them. Approach rather than flee; accept rather than reason away, lean into
whatever comes up, especially if your impulse is to run away. tay with the
experience,dive in and explore, allow yourself to be curious about what is
emerging in your experience. ‚ÄúTrust, let go, be open‚Äù.

‚óè Take a moment to acknowledge that what we are asking the participant to do
is difficult, counterintuitive and not our usual pattern of avoiding negative or
uncomfortable emotions and experiences. It may be something they will
have to remember over and over during the session.

‚óè There are methods for grounding and calming yourself, if you would like to
use them. We will teach you several of them before the end of today‚Äôs
session.

‚óè If you are having difficulty with anxiety, panic, nausea or paranoia, please let
us know, and we may be able to help you by providing reassurance, support,
redirection or therapeutic touch (if you give permission for that).",80,4333,10,698,1
2020-01-03 18:51:39,I took 450ug. No words.,"I dont even want to try and attempt to write a full trip report on my 450ug trip. As you cannot simply put that into words.

 I did make FULL contact with  the only thing my brain can comprehend to be ""god"".... its 2 alien-like entities. Like a ying and yang. But they each have their own ying and yang within.  And within that ying and yang there is another. Its infinite. 

They embodied my friends. But neither of my friends recall me talking to them. They explained EVERYTHING in the world is coincidentally meant to be. They also explained this ""life"" needs to be looked at as more of a simulation and people take it too seriously. There is way more to come. Our energy is just trapped in this human experience. There IS SO MUCH MORE.

 Even though this is a ""simulation"" you need to treat it like a race. We dont all win. But you need to know what your winning. Its not money or fame. Its something so much deeper. 

Love. 

It sounds so easy, yet its one of the hardest things to manifest.  ""Love"" isn't towards a specific thing/person. You just love, and you do it with meaning.

This world is a simulation of emotions. Manifesting your emotions is the key to manifesting your consciousness. Your consciousness stays with you for eternity. Im talking about YOUR consciousness. Not your conscious thoughts.
__________________________________________________

Im not trying to sound like a fucking weirdo. But i was full atheist before this experience. After this experience you cant convince me that there is anything other than those 2 entities. I still cant fucking believe that happened. But it did.
 I really wanted to keep this trip to myself as its VERY far out and hard to believe, even for myself. But there is a small percentage of people that know the TRUE power of LSD, im supplying this story for those people. Ive done so many different psychedelics. They all make you trip yeah. But NOTHING matches up to LSD. After what i experienced.. Im not expecting anyone to believe me. But im simply sharing my experience. So any hate can fuck right off!!!

2020-03-15 20:33:55,2000ug Trip Report," 

Date: 3/15/2020

Time: 6:00 pm

The time has come. I have been saving 10 200ug tabs just for today. I tested the tabs with an Ehrlich reagent and Hoffman reagent test. They were 100% good to go and so was I. I placed the 10 tabs on my tongue. They were tabs with smiley faces on them. They were very thin compared to past tabs I‚Äôve had but the tests came back positive so I thought nothing of it. They were very large so it was hard to fit all 10 on my tongue but after I did I snapped a pic on my phone and went downstairs to sit on my couch. I turn on Family Guy and go on my phone while I wait for it to kick in. A total of 10 minutes pass and shit is already swirling. I look at my tv and it starts warping in and out. I sit and enjoy the visuals. About 30 minutes pass of me just sitting on my couch, I go up to my room to lay on my bed as the body high was getting very intense. I lay on my bed and stair at my floor. The floor slowly begins to get covered in psychedelic symbols and patterns until my floor was no longer visible beneath them. I stare into the pattern on my floor and watch as it extends infinitely into nothingness, endlessly. 30 more minutes or so pass and I want to get out of my bed to get water but I‚Äôm afraid if I step on my floor I will fall through it into another dimension for all of eternity and never come back. My phone lights up and I can  barely make out that my friend is calling me. I pick up and we chat, I start giggling uncontrollably. I am not struggling to verbalize words at this point and I explain to him that I can‚Äôt step on my floor because I‚Äôll fall through it. He convinces me that I‚Äôll be fine and tells me to jump with both feet onto the floor. I do so and to my surprise I‚Äôm on solid ground. I'm not falling! I start giggling in relief. I lay on my floor and talk with my friend for a while until I get back on my bed and lay and listen to my friend. He adds another person to the call and they are at a party. There‚Äôs too much going on in the call at this point and I‚Äôm afraid my brain will shit itself if I keep listening. I leave the call and my friend calls me separately. We talk for a little until I can‚Äôt anymore. The body load is becoming too much and everything is getting very intense. I hang up.

I stumble to my bathroom, which is right across from my room, and I get over the toilet and attempt to throw up, but I can‚Äôt. The nausea is very intense but I can't vomit so I get back in my bed. I lay down and decide to turn on music. I lay listening to it and the euphoria begins to become outrageously intense. A wave of it rushes over me and it feels like a million orgasms. I look at my pants and see I fucken jizzed myself. I go and take a short shower to clean up. It felt like an eternity. I get back to my room and it‚Äôs 8:15. I start wondering how that happened to me. What caused me to jizz my pants?!?! And then I wondered who ‚Äúme‚Äù was. What did ‚Äúme‚Äù just do? ‚ÄúI‚Äù can't remember. Who‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äù, what's happening? My head falls to my pillow and I pass out.

There‚Äôs an orb of light. There's peace and tranquility. Time stops. In Fact time does not exist. It's irrelevant. It‚Äôs an eternity. Something comes and says something. A divine being of some sort. There is nothing actually there but its presence is noted. It guides the orb of light to a web. A web of thought and memories. Somethings memories. Memories of sadness despair and locked thoughts. Tragedies locked far away so that they did not have to be remembered. Memories that the memorizer denies. But why are these memories being viewed? What do they mean? The orb flies away and so does the divine presence. But if those left than what is stuck here observing these memories? There's nothing here to view them and yet they are still being viewed by something. All of the memories, bad and good, flash before the observer. The observer wonders what it is being shown. It decides to accept those memories as its own. It takes them and makes them part of what allows it to observe. The memories stop. There is light, and ‚ÄúI‚Äù awake.

I look at my hand. What is this. Where am I? I look to the right and stare at an object, an oval that reads 11:22 I stare at it trying to figure out what it means. What is this object trying to tell me? What message is it trying to get across to me? Then all the sudden the oval changes to 11:23 I can‚Äôt understand why it would change. This must mean something. Why am I seeing this? What am I here to learn? Obviously the answer must be around here somewhere. Wherever ‚Äúhere‚Äù is. I decide to forget about the oval to my right, it must not mean anything. I see a black object in my hand. I observe the object and find pushables on the side of it. Upon pushing one a light flashes from it. There is an image and it reads 11:23. I look at the oval which reads the same. As I stare at the oval I see the glowing screen change. It now reads 11:24 I look back at the oval and it reads the same! They must be connected. But why are both them displaying this. What could it mean? I stare and watch for what seems like forever. Watching them count up. I feel I understand what the objects are showing me. They are counting up to something. But to what. The oval changes to 11:29 next and I know what will happen! There will be an 11:2\_ and then a random symbol after that! But to my dismay that isn‚Äôt what happens. Instead the oval changes to 11:30. I can‚Äôt comprehend this! I just spent my entire existence trying to figure out how this object works and I was wrong. I had seen the 3 symbol before though why has it appeared again? I look up and try to figure out what's happening. I decide this object means nothing and it's just meant to mess with me. I give up.

I crawl out of this thing I'm lying in and head towards a part of the wall that seems to be of a different material than the rest of the walls. A rectangle with a gold circle halfway down it. I head towards it and examine the gold circle. I remember seeing this in a past existence perhaps? I grab it, it turns! The rectangle opens as I turn the gold knob and my heart drops. There is more than just this room. Across from me is another one of the rectangles but this one is already open. I head towards it. In this room I find An interesting item hanging on the wall. A reflection of sorts. A portal to a world just like the one I am in. I stare into it and see a being looking at me. Or is that me looking at me? No, how could that be. It‚Äôs body was covered with colorful swirls and psychedelic patterns. I notice writing on my arm it reads ‚ÄúLSD 2000ug‚Äù My mind flashes my memories start roaring back to me as I stare at myself in the mirror and begin piecing my identity back together. My life didn't start when I awoke on my bed next to that clock. I had a whole life before that and I‚Äôm still experiencing that life. After being in my bathroom for an eternity I finally figured out who I am. What makes me me, What me is. I feel one with all that is around me and I can understand every object as if it has a consciousness and feelings. Each psychedelic swirl I can relate to and understand. I go back to my room and read the clock 12:47. 6 hours and 47 minutes since I dropped and I‚Äôm still tripping sack.

The rest of the trip was very interpersonal and wasn‚Äôt as mind blowing as this part so I won't write about it as this is already super long. I didn‚Äôt stop tripping until 12 o'clock today where I started to write this report. This much LSD was insane and I can‚Äôt recommend anyone ever do this much but I also can't recommend against it. It was insane and I‚Äôm happy I did it, but I will never do this much again.",18,7647,3,1524,1

2020-10-08 23:42:37,Farenheit 451 is happening,"It's just not as dramatic. Less and less young people read at all, I know it intimately due to being young myself. Our dopamine receptors have been numbed and it simply isnt as enjoyable to read as it ought to be due to more instantly rewarding mediums of entertainment. This is not good.

We must recalibrate our dopamine receptors so we can appreciate and enjoy the slower things. Not only is it more difficult to read with our numbed dopamine receptors, it's also more difficult to enjoy a sunset, to find meaning out of a conversation with a family member. This is not good and as virtual reality and such advance, it will only get worse.

2022-08-03 19:21:50,I drank ~5g of mushrooms in tea last night and discovered the perfect beauty of jazz music. It's unbelievably good trip music.,"I was hanging out on the porch with my sober friend, and he began playing [My Favorite Things by John Coltrane](https://youtu.be/UlFNy9iWrpE). I was in a trance the entire time. I discovered myself to that album, found a divinity within myself that rises far above my material identity. I found a renewed beauty and sacred bond in friendship as I sat with my eyes closed and listened to their conversation with My Favorite Things guiding my focus. I saw the conversational nature of jazz and began to imagine my friends' conversation as nothing more than a jazz improv with words instead of instruments. That trip taught me how to really *listen* in conversation. I imagined my Self talking to me, telling me that in order to really hear and understand people, I have to set my Self aside to let another Self in. I believe now that the best way to communicate with others is to act as a mirror- allowing others to see themselves in me so they can open up and drop all the pretense that comes with one Self talking to another. I felt any false confidence I had melt away and be replaced with a real, genuine, sturdy confidence that comes from even deeper within myself. I am secure in a way I've never felt before, and that feeling comes from a greater understanding of myself and what it means to be a human in relation to other humans.

2020-07-04 16:12:16,30 gram attempt,Yesterday I and a couple friends went deep into the countryside and they trip sat me as I attempted to eat 30 grams of shrooms. I've had many large dose trips before from the 7to 10 gram range. This night was special though. My best friend (Tripsitter #1) was going to propose to his girlfriend in the morning and we had a guys night out essentially. Once we arrived I started shoveling the mushroom pills in my mouth. The capsules were definitely easier to swallow and it helped otherwise I never would have finished as much as I did. At six grams in the world started to melt. Every thing was turned into an almost Van Gough mixed with Salvador Dali painting and I took a more pills. Once I hit 12 grams I started to get INTENSE CEVs and even with open eyes my vision was slipping in and out of focus.It started to get impossible to walk over the beautiful but uneven terrain. I started crying uncontrollably because everything I was seeing was too beautiful for words. This whole time I'm having the most insane feeling confusion and I'm not really sure where I was or who I was or who my friends were. I started speaking in complete gibberish and I couldn't understand English. I kept swallowing pills and I hit 22 grams when I stopped finally and started screaming about dying. I cant recall that because at that point I was peaking completely delirious. The nature surrounding us was complete for miles. We hiked to a waterfall with a cave and I kept falling down and rolling around in the mud for some reason. I also pissed myself multiple times but I had expected to have absolutely no control over my bladder so I had brought backup pants.I started coming back to conscious reality about as the sun was setting making the most beautiful artwork in the sky where giant spirals were opening up like portals to other worlds. The mating calls of creatures all around us awakened a primal feeling deep within my chest. Finally about 6 hours after it started the trip gradually dropped me back into reality  leaving me a very contented and peaceful feeling. I love my friend and this trip definitely strengthened our friendship. There was a moment I was looking into a pool of tadpoles completely engulfed in psychedelia and awe when He sat down by me and started talking about the beautiful cycle of life.

2019-08-02 21:33:28,I am done with drugs. Thank you all for being a welcoming community.,"Hello r/psychonaut.

I have posted a while back about how I could use psychedelics as tools to deal with my problems. It was a small post, but I received level headed advice and very warm responses.

On my last trip I experienced the one thing I longed for the most in my life: Self love. I always considered my lack of self love as one of the root causes of most of my other problems. The rest shall come with time and work.

I also had yet another one of those ""you don't need drugs"" insights, and this time I will listen to it. I realized that I reacted quite sensetive to psychedelics... This is something I will take seriously from now on. I have to. 

Psychedelics - including cannabis - take my psyche to a place where I can no longer protect it from harm. Too much is happening without my control. You shouldn't have to fight while tripping. I had too. And with good reason. 

I have a past and a present with psychological problems. A history of bullying, abuse and neglect has taken its toll on me. I recognize irrational fears and overthinking over complete nonsense. I have problems. I know the cause of my problems. I am aware when they arise. I have all the knowledge I require in order to better myself. Psychedelics can no longer help me in that regard. Perhaps they can, but I have decided that they are not worth the risk.

Psychedelics are not for me. In a better world they could have been, but in this one my psychedelic journey is over. And a new journey begins.

Thank you all for your advice and affection. Stay awesome and enjoy your journey, with or without drugs.",68,1590,13,295,1

2021-06-12 15:36:10,"First time, did 6 grams of shrooms üò±","Well hey psychonauts!

I wanted a fun night last night. I figured I'd go big or go home like I do. I've done heavy doses of LSD so I figured I'd just meditate through this if it got too intense. Figured I was experienced enough.

Anyway I spent 2 hours on the floor in the fetal position, beyond sobbing, I was wailing, letting out every loss and every trauma of my lifetime and more. I was turned inside out. And then I released all that with vomiting (not upset stomach vomiting, releasing trauma vomiting).

Guys, I was wailing. I didn't even think I'd have a body after it was over. I wasn't scared because whatever state I was in was beyond fear.

Before the wailing, I literally felt the shrooms say, ""I want to get to know you. You used to play piano. Play the piano for me."" I haven't played in years because of nerve damage to my wrists. Anyway I plucked out a few notes and it was like the shrooms understood me and exposed me. And then it all just spilled out from there.

Anyway, today's a new day. I'm physically tired but I can breath for the first time in years. I dunno where my life goes next, but I hope I can live it without anymore fear. Maybe now I can actually be present for my own life. There's a lot of work ahead... 

So much work... I was born to do this work.",36,1287,8,249,1

Only briefly forgotten. Brother, sister, friends, mothers, farthers, children... I love you all, and we're all in this shit together. Let's make it better.

Edit: wow. Hadn't seen that coming. In all honesty I was drunk and depressed when out of somewhere came the need to tell everyone, anyone, someone that I care, which spawned the post above. Waking up to a bunch of gorgeous strangers and long lost brothers and sisters sharing a similar feeling of what we might call unfocused, or perhaps more poetically, universal love, did wonders not only for my physical hangover, but for the somewhat more persistent existential hangover as well.

Is it because all the kids from school are out for the summer? I thought most people here were smarter than this.

I'm seeing Nostradamus faces from the light on my cell mixing with the swirls of smoke. Then his hair turns into an Aztec headdress and he begins speaking to me. Tells me to go inside and wait on the couch, he'll be back. 

So I go inside, tripping balls in the dark living room. My daughter wakes up from a nightmare and comes out from her room crying. I flip into Dad Mode like a switch and we share a quick midnight snack. Off to bed. She's still afraid of her monster, so I lay down with her and we start to tell stories. 

She's really into My Little Pony, so she starts off with a generic plot from one of the episodes. The shrooms are kicking back in and I'm listening to her story...before long I'm flying along with the pegasus ponys and I take over telling the story for a minute. I take the ponys to the rainbow road into space and we fly through multiple rainbows and kaleidescope. My daughter then takes over the story and she takes us to a kingdom of dragons and a nice witch that was framed as a wicked witch, and it was our mission to correct it. And this continues, both of us switching and adding to each other's stories, for about an hour. 

Eventually she fell asleep. I got back to the living room and started writing down the stories we told as best as I could remember. This was one of the best trips I've ever had. All this time I thought tripping was seeing the world through a special lense. Now I know that lense is just as powerful as a child's imagination. I felt like I was finally seeing the world through my daughter's eyes, and the light she cast was as beautiful and radiant as a sunrise after a cold night.

2019-11-13 00:10:13,Psychedelics changed my life,"2019 ended up being the worst year of my life. My parents got divorced, my car‚Äôs (my biggest hobby) engine blew up, I lost my job and got evicted within the span of about January - March. It was super rough. I got super depressed and suicidal at times and ended up living at a friends apartment. I did nothing besides eat junk food and smoke weed and it was truly miserable. 

I ended up tripping with my friend at his apartment. We each dropped 250 ug and had a blast. It was the next time we dropped that really affected me.

I ended up doing 300 ug of acid and this time it wasn‚Äôt fun. I had a terrible trip. It was super dark and depressing. I saw how shit my life was and on the comedown I realized I was practically homeless and a total bum. It felt like I was seeing into my future and what I would become if I stayed like this...

So I changed everything. The next day I called my dad and asked him if I could come home. Thankfully he was happy to let me. 

I‚Äôm doing so much better now. I have a great job that pays really well and I‚Äôm slowly getting my life back together.

2019-09-07 18:47:31,Here's how I KNOW you're tripping.,"Just some context, I teach Yoga and work at a float centre (sensory deprivation tank facility) for a living so between the two I get to have lots of interesting conversations with the people I meet at work. This includes relatively open conversations about psychedelics with total strangers which is honestly so refreshing to not feel the overbearing pressure of social stigma and illegality weighing down on my workplace conversations. Now at the float centre in specific I've seen quite a few people come in for their session with big smiles and even bigger pupils. Just an hour ago I had a young couple come into the float centre with dinnerplate eyes and a look of wonder on their faces. I was pretty sure they were tripping so I put on some chill music for them in the lobby while they filled out their paperwork.

Anyway here's how I KNOW they we're tripping: The big eyes we're a pretty good hunch but I wouldn't say I was certain of it quite yet. I took them into the rooms with the pods and let me just set the scene for you a little. The door is in a hallway off the main lobby that leads into a small, neon-lit room with a big float pod in the centre, a shower in the corner, and some plants around the place. As soon as I opened the door and walked them into the room they both looked around in amazement and got a little shiver and said ""oooh it's different in here"". That's when I was certain of it, that little shiver you get with the feeling of a massive energy change when you walk into a new environment. God I love that feeling. Anyway I just found that kinda funny and wanted to share, thanks for reading friends!",34,1633,6,306,1

Growing up I had great respect for teachers, police officers, politicians etc, but since I've started taking psychedelics that is fading away. Things are illegal arbitrarily, and laws are not in my best interests. If psychedelics aren't melting my brain and getting me addicted to crack, what else have they lied about?

Now fair, I live in South Africa and corruption is rampant, I'm ok having a large stock of psychs in my apartment because if I was ever caught it's a matter of buying lunch for the officer and calling it even. How do other people feel, in more civilized countries,",60,707,9,125,1

2019-03-28 13:23:44,I always have to remind myself that tripping isn‚Äôt for everyone.,"I had a breakthrough trip. At first I had totally just taken psychs with my friends to fuck around. Which is totally fine and loads of fun. Then one day it just happened. Like holy shit, everything changed. I had one of those trips I had always heard about but never really believed in. I tried the Terrence McKenna sensory deprivation method with 5 grams of shrooms and I came out a completely different person. And I loved all the changes about myself. It was undeniable I had changed into a more understanding and loving person. I fixed my relationship with my mom which had been damaged since I got arrested at 14. We talk everyday. Just an big example of one of the ways it really changed my life. 

So, of course I told everyone. How couldn‚Äôt I?! I thought I could save everyone else. I even helped get everyone I could get some shrooms and told them about the method and what to expect. I have to say I got some great feedback and will continue to spread the message, BUT only to those searching for something like that. 

I found myself getting too preachy, which I know is my fault. I was making too many assumptions about everyone and found not everyone wanted an experience like that. It‚Äôs weird because I think everyone could benefit from what I experience but I know my experience was personal and subjective. So I‚Äôm learning to leave it alone more and wait for someone to ask me about it.

The weird thing about it is that I have been slowly reading The Prophet by Khalil Gibran, maybe a chapter a week. The chapters are like 3 pages long but I figured I really need to let the messages need enough time resonate with me. SO, I was thinking about all this stuff and decided I needed some quick prophet wisdom so I open the book and the chapter I‚Äôm on is titled ‚ÄúSelf Knowledge,‚Äù almost exactly what I needed to read at the time... and this is what I read:


‚ÄòSay not, ‚ÄúI have found the truth,‚Äù but rather, ‚ÄúI have found a truth.‚Äù
Say not, ‚ÄúI have found the path of the soul.‚Äù Say rather, ‚ÄúI have met the soul walking upon my path.‚Äù
For the soul walks upon all paths.‚Äô

Just an excerpt, but the message is clear here. I‚Äôm taking this as a sign from the universe that I‚Äôm on the right path on wanting to help people, but that I shouldn‚Äôt preach how my path helped me but more learn to help others find their own path. Maybe at the end of the day it‚Äôs not even about the psychedelics. But helping people is something I am very passionate about now and hopefully I can keep growing and learning how to help others through their own means! 

Cheers :)

2019-07-15 18:08:47,"After taking LSD, I became really good at mathematics.","It was about 4 years ago when I first tried LSD while I was still in undergrad and I'm not sure how exactly, but it completely rewired the way my brain approaches math.

I had struggled with mathematics all my life having to be tutored after school every single day in grade and high school just to get average grades. 

This followed me into my freshman amd sophomore year of college so I decided to be a history major which wasn't math heavy. I was in my second semester of my sophomore year when I dropped for the first time on the weekend towards the beginning of the semester.

I didn't feel or know that anything was different after the trip but when I got back into the classroom on monday, I found that I was strangely reading the material totally differently.

It was like I had always been trying to read a different language but now it felt as natural as speaking English. I then went on to make A for the first time ever in a math class(calculus) and actually enjoyed what I was learning.

I don't know for sure if it was the LSD but shortly after taking it, something in my mind switched and I ended up graduating with a bachelor's in finance and statistics and went on to get a master's just last year in finance.",54,1227,9,231,1
2019-09-15 01:17:19,I‚Äôve decided to try to go as far as possible,"A lot of you will call me crazy. Hell, most of you might. 

I‚Äôve been planning this out for a month. I‚Äôve given it thought every day. I‚Äôve been meditating on it for a week. Yet I can‚Äôt find any apprehension to my plan. I want this. 

I know a lot about drugs. Psychedelics in particular. I think I‚Äôve devised a way to go as deep as possible. I‚Äôve gone through possible drug combinations in my head and I simply can‚Äôt think of one that may be more psychedelically intense than the one that I plan to do this coming Wednesday.

My previous psychedelic experience is mushrooms (up to 7 grams), LSD (up to 500mcg), DMT, and some of the research chemical psychedelics like 4-ACO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, and 4-HO-MIPT

Here‚Äôs the plan;

Start off with 150mg of ketamine snorted as quickly as possible.

Wait about 10 minutes or before I feel I‚Äôm about to hole. Whichever comes first. While I‚Äôm waiting, my friend will be loading up a Volcano vaporizer bag full of 60mg of DMT.

Right before I‚Äôm about to hole, I will suck in as much DMT as I can. This should be pretty easy as ketamine tends to make it easier to smoke things without any pain.

After this I will of course be dead to the world, but internally blasting straight through the stratosphere.

My friend will wait 1 minute for my oxygen levels to rise again after smoking and holding in the DMT.

After which, he will use a nitrous mask on me. 10 seconds on, 10 seconds off.

For those who don‚Äôt know; psychedelics, nitrous, and ketamine all potentiate each other exponentially. I‚Äôve done ketamine+ nitrous in the past and ketamine+ DMT in the past and both were mind-boggling experiences. I‚Äôm ready to see how all three play together. If my presumptions are correct, this experience should be several-fold more intense than an average DMT breakthrough. Then again, there may be a ceiling to how far you can go.

I‚Äôve done my homework. This should be completely physically safe. Spiritually, psychologically, or emotionally safe? Now that‚Äôs a different story.

I'm not even going to put your initials here, but your names I do remember. If by some strange chance you read this you'll know who you are. This would have been, maybe, 1997, or maybe '96 or '98? Tulum, Mexico, on the perfect 8-mile long white sand beach. You had a strip of unperforated white blotter you were using as a bookmark to get through customs. We met eating lunch at the cafe in the place that rented cheap palapas on the beach, right next to the ruins, and you asked if we wanted some acid. You gifted us two tabs each, we ate them in the morning the next day. 

The girl and I had sex in the public shower as it was coming on, lol. Body-surfed for hours. Freaked the fuck out (in a good way) in another beach shower while peaking; it was face-melting intense. The world was flickering fractals, every drop of water looked like a tiny rainbow jewel. The look the Mexican guy loafing outside gave us when we left was absolutely classic. We strolled on the perfect beach in the sunset, watching the pelicans play in the wind. To this day I still think brown pelicans are one of the most beautiful birds in existence. Two tabs turned out to be a solid dose! We tripped for 18 hours. Ended the night fucking like monkeys in a hammock on the beach. 

To this day that remains one of the most perfect and absolutely magical acid trips of my entire life, and part of me feels like I was not sufficiently grateful when we saw you the next day.

These practices allow us to better understand our personalities and reasonings behind our actions and emotional feelings because we are forced to confront our bad habits, problems, and sources of suffering in our lives. 

Once we become aware of these previously unconscious issues that controlled the direction of our lives, we are now able to examine it consciously. This awareness allows us to analyze and make the appropriate changes needed to improve our lives. 

Whereas before, our lack of understanding of why we weren‚Äôt happy or successful was the ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù that controlled our lives and we called it fate. 

This shift in control from the unconscious to the conscious is EXACTLY why these practices are so important. Because they show us what‚Äôs going on in our lives behind the scenes and allow us to better understand ourselves. With this new and profound knowledge, it provides us the opportunity to improve ourselves, others, and hopefully soon society as a whole. (Legalize psychedelics!)

No additional layer of existential obligation exists beyond those consequences--unless you say it does. Now, I think it's common for us to understand *conceptually* the ultimate purposelessness of our anxieties, but I encourage you to take a moment right now and really *feel* it. Look around the room you are in, or at the landscape if you are outside. Pick an object, and ask if it depends upon your continued existence and effort. Chances are, no. Become viscerally aware of your breath *right now* and feel your body from the *inside*. Stay with it for a moment. That peace? That stillness? It's telling you that you're forever and already off the hook. There is absolutely nothing that you are *supposed* to be doing right now. If you choose to get back to work, fine! But whatever it is, know that it's a game. If it doesn't evoke your enthusiasm, then it probably doesn't deserve your anxiety either. You are not even ""supposed"" to relax, meditate, take psychedelics, exercise, eat healthy, etc. If you're doing those things, then awesome, but you are not completing some divine checklist by doing so. Nirvana is already in you, if only lurking in the stillness waiting patiently for you to notice.

Aren't we *supposed* to care for them?"" I feel like I could have filled that in more thoroughly in my post. What that comes down to is empathy, I think. Empathy is authentic, it drives us to act, and it doesn't have to come with the baggage of ""I really should..."" or ""I'm supposed to."" And for those among us who do not possess empathy or are not currently motivated by it, you are probably caring for others insofar as you do because you empathize with *yourself* and the discomfort that would come from the social consequences of your neglect. I still maintain that the anxiety of ""I'm supposed to..."" not only robs you of the present moment, but is useless and unnecessary in the act of being a loving, compassionate being.

I got completely lost for about 2-3 hours thinking about my amazing girlfriend. I‚Äôll call her Helen. I found that I am Helen-sexual. I forgot both our names and our genders and all I cared about was that she was ‚ÄúHerself‚Äù and I was me. Thinking of her face and her laugh and her voice and the amazing sex we have and how great she is and how I enjoy any time I spend with her whether we‚Äôre at the farmers market, going hiking, binge watching Netflix all day, anything, gave me the most intense euphoria I‚Äôve ever had in my life. I kept checking myself because I thought I was having orgasms. For the first time in my life I felt this primal urge to give her children, be with her forever and do whatever I can to make her happy. I‚Äôm so lucky I can‚Äôt even believe it. She has told me many times that she‚Äôs very in love with me and I with her. But I had been scared to really let myself go and feel what I truly felt about her because it‚Äôs scary and my dumbass felt I hadn‚Äôt been with enough women (7). I do not feel that way anymore. She is all I‚Äôll ever need. She‚Äôs beautiful, caring to a fault, has the biggest heart out of anyone I‚Äôve ever met, is hilarious and she loves my dumb ass. We‚Äôre both 27, comfortable financially, have good career paths a head of us and have gotten past the tumultuous part of our 20s (for the most part). Weve been together for 6 months which I know is short but we‚Äôve spent a lot of time together. She‚Äôs the one.

2021-07-04 13:39:32,"The brain is evolved for survival, NOT accuracy. Psychedelics reveal underlying truth.","I think evolution has kitted our brains out to HIDE reality, not to show it. This makes sense. The reality is, in even the most materialist paradigm everything is part of the universe. For a creature this view would make survival harder or even impossible so it must be hidden. It must be hidden so the creature identifies self and other and cares for only its own survival.

Everything being consciousness (√† la Brahman, etc) is an idea that would diminish a creature's urgency to survive, so the idea must be hidden.

When people smoke DMT or whatever, they have wild hallucinations. But consider for a moment, there are almost infinite things you could hallucinate. You could hallucinate you're buying groceries at the supermarket. But no, there's always an underlying ""here's the secrets of reality"" tone. It's very weirdly specific that it hones in on that... Then you Google it and discover the ""space clown"" just endowed you with the entirety of the Upinashads. Like wtf?

I think these drugs are simply undoing the lies our brain perpetuates to ensure survival. The truth is already there. Our brains KNOW the truth. It's just hiding it because hiding truth and displaying only what is beneficial for survival is evolutionarily advantageous.

When the brain's default way of being (deceitful) is disrupted by drugs, the truth is so glaringly obvious as to be comical. Psychedelics are switching off our brain and reverting us to a state stumbled upon by mystics and saints.

SOBER life is the hallucination. That is the deceit. A huge complex web of deceit that tries to ensure survival and replication over accuracy. If seeing colors as sounds was evolutionarily beneficial, that's how we would experience color. The brain does not care about showing you what is real.",86,1777,12,298,1
2020-04-26 09:51:51,The man charged with '88 pounds of liquid DMT',"First off, it's probably a total of 28-38 grams. There were 25 jars in there, maybe a litre each. They weight EVERYTHING, including jars, and call it DMT.

Secondly, this guy really needed help. He's being praised here for spreading the love etc etc. Please look into his facebook, especially his concerned mother of whom he posted screenshots of and said to her to stop texting him, otherwise he'll block her.

He recently got out of jail again, has a very concerned mother he's talking shit about. Or the girl Elsa. He's lost himself to DMT. DMT is wonderful, having a few grams myself. Spreading the love is great as well, I share it with all my friends that want to try it. But dealing it for money, talking shit about everyone that doesn't use or whatever really goes way beyond. There's no more enlightenment, only confusion. It's a powerful drug not meant for everyone. Some find the beauty in life again, others go nuts. As much as I'd like to say DMT is safe and good for everyone, that's just not the case.

Yes, hallucinogenics are way better than most drugs in terms of toxicity and addiction. I occasionally trip and don't smoke, barely drink, enjoy life and the people around me. But just like other drugs it can still be abused. It doesn't happen anywhere close as much as other drugs are being abused, but it can be abused. He is the perfect example. Psychedelics can make you believe stuff, that can either be good or bad.

2022-03-08 20:45:00,I did too many shrooms with my partner and we became worm Gods.,"My partner and I decided to take shrooms last night (chocolate bar). We planned on a microdose, but boy did we fucked up the dosage. We decided to watch Invader Zim (into the florpus movie) whilst the shroomies kicked in. Bout halfway in I started to feel the floaty and giggly, followed by patterns and colors appearing on the TV and bedroom walls. That's when I realized that we didn't take a microdose. We started talking more and my boyfriend was adamant on telling me how ""noodlely"" his arms and legs felt. This is where the worm discussion began.. We were convinced that we were worms at that point, stranded on the bed with our clothes off. It wasn't a bad thing, though. Being a worm wasn't half bad. Though what was really bizarre was that i developed a british accent, which I kept up for hours without trying (I am american but my parents are british so I used to have an accent as a child). It was fun to laugh till it hurt, declaring ourselves worm God and Goddess. At that point our conversations were the same as our normal stupid philosophical discussions, but more.. *wormy.* We spoke about how we were going to move into our worm apartment together soon, followed by adopting two worm cats. Every time we had to pee it was like a fucking adventure to the bathroom. His parents were in the room next door so we had to put clothes on, and worms don't wear clothes so it was hysterical trying to put a shirt on. The vibe in the bathroom was so different since the lights are much more bright and sterile, compared to the dimly lit bedroom with light only flooding from the TV. I enjoyed staring at my boyfriend in the bright light, admiring his beautiful long hair and hazel eyes. God we kept laughing so fucking loud I can only imagine what his parents thought when we were in the bathroom for what felt like an hour. Anyway, we went back in the bed and watched adventure time. We kept licking each other so we had sex which was intense while tripping. It was the perfect trip, which ended with him spending $50 on taco bell and us knocking out immediately after.",63,2079,13,384,1

I didnt realise it was the police until he said so and that they had found LSD in a package send to me. They said they had the right to search my apartment and so they did. Three police officers entered my apartment. I was allowed to write in my game that i could no longer play anylonger but not that the police was here. Strange. While they searched i wasnt allowed to do anything just sit and wait. So they found mushrooms, MDMA and dmt. They asked what it was and they didnt even knew what dmt was. They also called for a dog to come and sniff my apartment but they had found all i had. They also searched my mailbox and my room in the cellar. They looked through my phone and asked what i was using wikr for. And why i was travelling so much - going to parties and such. I told them i havent done anything to anyone and that you cant get addicted to the drugs im taking and that it helps me psychological and that im getting better at work because of this. They then said the customs had found a package send to me containing LSD and a small quantity of cocaine. I told them i had not ordered cocaine. They beleived it and they scratched that, but now that i think of it, i think they detected the package because of the cocaine.

2020-07-08 19:08:18,The blissful reality of sobriety.,"Let me just put this out there, I am an escapist. I will try to find any means to get away from my sober world. I've always felt as though I was brought into this world just to suffer. But today I've realized something, something that makes me actually appreciate being sober; and that's the bliss of being alive.

I was always so caught up in my head paying mind to all the negatives, hardships, pains and misfortunes that I completely overlooked something. And that something is the painstakingly obvious fact that I am alive. I am living, and this body of mine is here to help me get what I want. But I never thought about what I already have, until now.

It feels *good* to be alive! It's so easy to forget and brush that off, but if you ever just actually sit there and pay mind to what it truly feels like to *be,* then you'll know what I mean.

It's pure ecstasy! My mind is clear. My thoughts carry no weight, and my body suffers not. I'm relaxed, I can breathe, and I can really focus on the beauty of the world I find myself in.

---

I can feel my heart pumping warmth through my being. I can feel the electricity in the air and on my skin, it's ecstatic! The angelic songs produced by birds carry themselves to my ears. The smell of the earth fills my nose and draws me in closer, more intimately. The sight of green leaves; waving trees moving with the wind in a dance so perfect. The rippling water down in the creek giving guise to the minnows who swim just underneath.

The experience of gravity, holding me here and giving me ground to stand upon. My muscles and veins, relaxed and pulsating to the rhythm of my heart. My skin‚Äîallowing the sun to bathe me in its luminous heat.

But nothing compares to what I now feel inside of me.

A vast, immensely bliss awareness that oversees all of this beauty. One who allows me the glory of experiencing this world. One who remains unaltered in a reality destined to crumble and fizzle out. I have become that One. I've found my center.

I am truly outside of time. I feel the eternity that resides between moments. A place where clocks are meaningless, linearity out the window. Space, only a background for me to coincide with. It holds my form, allows me the privilege of shape and mobility. 

It honestly is a bizarre thing to be alive, to be here. To witness this magnificent show. But I'm going to enjoy every minute of it.

Much love, fellow beings.",33,2415,5,450,1

2021-05-25 22:51:44,Please tread lightly while using psychedelics for inner work.,"Yes, tripping can be a useful tool for inner work while used in moderation. But please, please be careful. Especially if you already suffer from mental illness, trauma and/or are neurodivergent.

There is such thing as overdoing it.

These substances are still substances at the end of the day, and /will/ affect your brain chemistry. They can do some serious damage if overdone.

I have endured psychosis from trips that have given me lasting symptoms of dissociation and possible PTSD that I am still trying to recover from. These drugs will wreck havoc on your brain if not taken seriously, and it can take a lot of mental work to come back from.

I know this is probably a no-brainer for a lot of people.... But when you're young and new to tripping and experiencing new  mind-opening revelations in that state, it can be so tempting to keep chasing and searching for answers. But that chase can turn into a rabbit hole of despair if you abuse it and aren't in the right state of mind. It will catch up to you quickly.

Tripping and reflecting can only go so far if you don't have the real, concrete things in your life sorted out. Finding the meaning of life and experiencing oneness or whatever, is beautiful until you lose sight of what's real and find that reality is slipping out of your hands. It's important to know when to take a step back and work on your shit.

I just hope this finds its way to some people who are still new to the magical world of psychedelics.

I myself am done with tripping for a while. I thank this community for all the information & sense of unity you've all shared. My brain needs a break and I need to focus on more concrete things. Thank you all <3",61,1690,9,310,1

2019-10-14 13:42:47,I packed my computer away tonight.,"I apologise if this is not for this reddit, but I need to get this off my chest.

After my last trip, I never realised how bored I was of life. I realised a lot of things are going my way, but I was just wanting to make my life harder. Instead of going out and exploring a new city, I'd stay home and play games. Instead of learning a creative skill, I'd watch pointless YouTube videos. Instead of looking at how beautiful the nature is around me, I'd sweat up in a room with 3 fans on me. I did stuff, but when I got bored, my days would mostly consist of: gaming, watch something or do all this stuff in front of the computer without having to move. I kind of got sick of the ""convenience"" of it, so tonight, I saved everything I needed to onto a usb (have a mediocre laptop I can use incase) and packed it. There's a chance I'll go back to it eventually, but I figured if I can go 1 day of not gaming, I can go 1 month. I want life to be better for myself and if I'm sitting down, then how am I meant to achieve that?

I still feel pretty shitty about life, my aura has definitely dimmed since I've moved and I've lost my touch with my inner mind, hopefully by doing this, removing a parasite from me, I'll be able to become myself.",34,1235,6,248,1

2020-02-16 15:49:27,Psychedelics are not the only way to further your progression as a psychonaut.,"Not knocking psychedelics at all I love them. Psychedelics are the quickest and easiest way to force yourself to experiance an altered concious in a short period of time. But the psychedelics are simply the catalyst for the experiance. You can train your mind to experiance altered states without substances. Like I said not bashing psychedelics at all I still use them occasionally and love them. But there's also subtle ways to experiance different states of conciousness on a day to day basis. 

Meditation really can bring you to some trippy states, finding out which foods and activity can stimulate your endocannabinoid systems is a great way of playing with your brain. Even certain teas can induce intense relaxation with the right mix of mindfulness and diet. And my favorite is various breathing exercises! Combine all these together and bam your the one making the connections in your brain and its great and mostly free, minus the diet and teas but meditation yoga and breathing exercises can take you to some deep places.

And the best part is you can apply these practices the next time you trip and you will not be disappointed! Psychedelics are great, insperational, and beautiful alone but why stop there. Why not go the extra mile and further your experiance. After all theres more then one way to fry a fish. Have a great day fellow psychonauts!",78,1364,13,232,1
2019-03-23 01:08:12,Is it ego death or real death?,"I‚Äôm old, a 60s acid freak. I trip a lot, every three or four days on gigantic doses if time will allow. 

Today I decided to die. My analytical mind calculated the time was perfect. Of all the paths before me, this one was the path of least resistance. 

I wrote a goodbye note to my wife and told her she can find me sitting in the chair in our garden area when she gets home from work. 

All death is suicide. No one dies without giving permission. I‚Äôm ready, everyone knows I‚Äôm going to die, it‚Äôs only time, why not do it now?

I sat on my chair and focused on letting go of my body. My dogs started barking and the chickens were running towards me to wish me off. 

Everything became transparent. I was before God- the God as I understood it to be. I was invited in but first I had to review my life. Billions of my life moments flashed before me. All of the pain I‚Äôve caused was gone, and only the love of the family I created remained. My four children with all of my love and so much smarter, with their seven children, smarter than their parents. 

Winds blew across my face and transported me to ‚ÄòThe Beach‚Äô in 1969. Just bliss. I became an acid freak that summer on the beach. When I moved there the only ones living there were total freaks. That summer my beach would have numerous ‚Äòcampers‚Äô living there and celebrating life with lsd. My tribe. At night with the music being the crashing of the Pacific Ocean campfires were everywhere.  I would drift from campfire to campfire. 

I met the mother of my children there. After she and I moved on from the beach they made it a state park, but they won‚Äôt let anyone sleep in my caves. 

I thought someone needs to return and teach people to say no to anger and hate. Make love stories not war. And to spread the truth that there is no death. But it‚Äôs too late for me, and besides no one listens. People think I‚Äôm either mad or extremely eccentric when I was alive, and now I‚Äôm dead. 

I was ready to transition when my cell phone rang. By this time I‚Äôm almost gone. When the phone rings you answer it. So of course I answered it. 

It was the owner of the company I manage. He said ‚Äúyou are not leaving me are you?‚Äù and laughed. He went on and on about how valuable I am to him. 

He gave me two interesting and challenging projects to do. I said to myself if I‚Äôm going to hang around longer it‚Äôs going to be on my terms. I got up and went into the house to get myself a cigar. 

I was not peaking when this happened to me. It seems I always either peaking or in between. This time I was in between. People use to say I make this shit up, but fuck man, I could tell stories you can‚Äôt believe but are true. ~merlin ",30,2672,7,520,1

2019-07-01 17:10:51,‚ÄúThe psychotic drowns in the same waters in which the mystic swims with delight.‚Äù: I learned to swim,"[This is a follow up to a previous post which you can read here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/ahz25h/the_psychotic_drowns_in_the_same_waters_in_which/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

TLDR for the previous post:

I was heavily depressed and was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. I have tried many different antidepressives and antipsychotics but they all just made me extremely depressed and void of emotions. I figured out that my suffering stems from me rejecting my psychosis instead of letting go, exactly like a psychedelic trip. I decided to stop viewing my hallucinations and psychosis as bad and it had a positive impact on my life.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

It's around 5 months since I made that last post and I honestly can't believe that I'm doing so good as I am today. When I wrote that last post I was on a combination of a heavy dose of antipsychotics and some antidepressants. I no longer take any medication today and I haven't for at least 3 months.

I still hallucinate every day and I am honestly probably what would be deemed ""psychotic"" right now but I am doing better than I have ever done in my life and I wouldn't change a thing. After having been sick and not being able to attend university for well over 2 years I am now completing courses with good grades again, while having a job on the side. If everything goes to plan I have a bachelor in computer science around the start of 2020.

Honestly this whole experience has taught me that there is no such thing as ""mental illness"". Bipolar, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, it's not really an illness in my opinion, at least not in the meaning that it's going to reduce your quality of life. You might not be able to live a ""normal"" life if you hallucinate everyday, but honestly I handle stress better than 90% of my peers and in my opinion it's all about controlling your mind instead of letting it control you. This is where most people go wrong in my opinion.

The Buddhist where right in their description of the mind. It's a raging drunk monkey that is out of control and if you don't control him, he will control you. For some people this monkey is rather quiet and don't make much noise. They can go through their life and be generally happy without any major issues. For others the monkey might be a little ADHD and it needs a bit more attention to not go wild. In my case it's not just a monkey but a 500kg genetically modified gorilla on steroids that needs controlling and it takes a lot to control, but it is possible.

I spend around 2-3 hours every single day just to be able to control my mind. I do Wim Hof breathing as soon as I get up, then I do a short 5-10 min core / stability exercises and then I go meditate under a cold shower for as long as I can (used to only be able to handle 5 secs, now I just sit under the cold water for 20 mins). I then sit down to study and I'm really trying to be as mindful as I can, because I probably have some ADHD as well (I tried meth and it just made me calm and focused), so every time I get distracted I do some Wim Hof breathing and continue. After a couple hours of this I go the the gym and then come home and meditate under a cold shower again and then continue to study until my girlfriend comes home from work. If I have to go to school or work I just mix up the schedule but it's pretty much the same. I usually meditate 20-30 minutes before bed as well because I have trouble with insomnia, but a very strict bedtime routine and meditation has totally cured that.

I also make sure to eat relatively healthy. After I started meditating a lot I got a lot more mindful about how certain things affect me. Sugar makes me very anxious apparently and if I drink soda I will usually become in a way worse mood after drinking it, so I just decided to cut it out. Still going through this elimination / inclusion process on my diet, but damn, mindfulness really makes a difference.

I get that there a probably a lot of people sitting here thinking that their depression or something can't be cured as simple as that but I will bet anyone that if they exercise every day, take cold showers, do deep breathing techniques, meditate for at least an hour every day and practice mindfulness for the rest of the day and make sure to eat healthy, then they won't be depressed anymore.

People just don't want to put that kind of effort into it or they tell themselves they can't or make up some other kind of excuse and honestly I get it. I spend much of my life being thinking all these things but it was only when I actually made a decision to do something about it that things changed. It's easy feeling bad but it takes hard work to be happy. Of course you can't implement all of this overnight, but it's about baby steps and being consistent. On your bad days you might only be able to do 1 breath of meditation and that's okay. Strive for 2 breaths the next day and 3 breaths the day after that. Slowly over time progress will come but if you tell yourself that ""I deserve a day off"" or ""I'm just too tired to do it today"" even for one day, then your mind realizes that excuses are a valid thing and you will soon stop doing all the good things altogether.

It's your mind, it's your choice and you can control it if you really want to.",100,5352,18,976,1
2020-03-23 02:51:30,3 grams of shrooms changed my life,"I‚Äôll keep this short because I myself don‚Äôt like reading long text:

I broke up with the love of my life four months ago, and he‚Äôs been haunting me internally ever since. My mistakes I‚Äôve made, the fact that I‚Äôll never get him again, it breaks me every day. 

Until today I ingested a solid three grams of liberty caps. The come up anxiety was real as I forgot who I was, why I existed, and had intense hallucinations. My ego was gone. 

I was tripping on a beautiful hike not too rural, but not too urban either. I don‚Äôt really know when it happened, but at some point, my existential terror ceased, and I slipped into a beautiful peace realizing how little I matter in the face of the beauty of the forest. 

Much more than this happened, but my two main takeaways are this: people come into our lives, and can very much change them, for the good or the bad. But no matter what, everyone is on their own journey, and how much another person affects your life, is in the end, up to you. That‚Äôs when I developed a deep and profound love for myself, a beautiful, selfless love, and let go of my ex once and for all. 

The second isn‚Äôt really the point of this post, but I must mention regardless. I am a Christian, but the mundane, everyday fluff of the Bible was starting to drag on me. Until I tripped today, now I‚Äôve tripped on shrooms before but this was something else. My first true meditative experience. And I saw God in everything. In myself, in the trees, air, dirt, bark, etc. The world was breathing as one entity, and I took euphoric joy in the fact that I‚Äôm just moving through this world, and no, my mistakes do not matter as much as I thought they did.

DARE told me drugs are bad, and I believed them.

Then I read Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion by Sam Harris.

In the book, Harris tries to answer the following question:

>‚ÄúIs there a form of happiness beyond the mere repetition of pleasure and avoidance of pain?‚Äù

Most of us conclude that there isn‚Äôt anything in this life outside of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain at all costs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor at least we live our lives as such.

Harris makes the case for another path:

>‚ÄúI can attest that when one goes into silence and meditates for weeks or months at a time, doing nothing else, one has experiences that are generally unavailable to people who have not undertaken a similar practice.‚Äù

Harris describes the meditative practice of Vipassana as a means for cultivating a state of mind called ‚Äúmindfulness""...

>""A state of clear, nonjudgmental, and undistracted attention to the contents of consciousness, whether pleasant or unpleasant.‚Äù  
>  
>‚ÄúCultivating this quality of mind has been shown to reduce pain, anxiety, and depression; improve cognitive function; and even produce changes in gray matter density in regions of the brain related to learning and memory, emotional regulation, and self-awareness.‚Äù

If it's good enough for science, it‚Äôs good enough for me.

But after months of practice, I still couldn't make sense of what Harris described as the point of meditation...

>""The conventional sense of self is an illusion ‚Äî and spirituality largely consists in realizing this, moment to moment.‚Äù

He goes onto describe LSD and similar psychedelics as a temporary path towards reaching such a state.

But he urges caution...

>‚ÄúIf LSD is like being strapped to a rocket, learning to meditate is like gently raising a sail.‚Äù

After a couple months of drifting at sea, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúFuck sailing. I want to go to space.‚Äù

# The Best Day of My Life

It was a stupidly perfect day in Golden Gate Park as tears of laughter flooded our faces.

My friends and I had just dropped a tab of LSD, and a mentally challenged dog was serving as our entertainment.

https://preview.redd.it/zkz2vurk3pd61.jpg?width=968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=794f543773bbda975d99a9f1ccd855b14de44b40

The pup spent what seemed like hours diving after a frisbee and landing full force on his head. After knocking out the few brain cells he had left, he'd pop up with a smile to do it again.

After breaking down the logistics of stealing this guy‚Äôs dog, I became overwhelmed by just how much was happening in a single moment.

Gone was the never-ending movie of my past. Gone was the incessant worrying over things that haven‚Äôt yet happened and likely never will. All that remained was everything.

I felt like I had been dreaming my entire life and I was finally awake.

I could feel my body being pulled down by gravity in a way I had never appreciated. I could see the vibrant colors and light of the remarkable world before my eyes without getting stuck in the conceptual nature of forms.

I could hear so many goddamn sounds.

And I could taste like my life depended on fully appreciating every fleeting moment of Hasbro Sour Gummy goodness on my tongue.

If you ever need proof that God is real, take a 100mcg of LSD and eat a pack of these bad boys.

https://preview.redd.it/332jzwno3pd61.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=10a78768730237a17cc03c08269c622ea3e2e26a

If I could sum up the experience, my ego dissolved and with it came the freedom to exist in a space of consciousness devoid of the baggage that comes with the self

While my first-time taking LSD was experientially one of the best days of my life, it was the path it led me down, where mindfulness has become the most important and rewarding part of my life, that has given me confidence in calling my first tango with LSD my best day ever.

You can't take a high dose of LSD and function in the world, but mindfulness can be used anytime, anywhere.

With the help of Sam Harris‚Äô guided-meditation app Waking Up, my experience with psychedelics has led me to practicing meditation daily for the last three years.

And after a couple silent meditation retreats and many hours practicing at home, I'm seeing now that my selfless nature was here with me all along.

LSD helped me realize that space flight was possible, but I know now that my mind can reach these heights without drugs.

And seeing the illusory nature of the self doesn't require 10,000 hours of meditation practice either.

With the right instruction, you can see your true nature within a few hours.

Thanks for reading :) There's not much I enjoy more than chatting about this space, so I'd love to hear from you all.

And you can follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mistertitchener) for more on drugs, mindfulness, and waking up.

To be fair, I was an almost daily vape user for the last 10 years, but I recently took a break while I look for a new job. I decided today to take a small toke after missing it.

I am remembering just how unjust the world is. I left my job because I was too stressed. I was binge drinking and ending up hospitalized. Trading my sanity for money.

I remember that now I'm on a substitute chemical pill and was diagnosed bipolar, thus forever giving me a label. I remember being super skeptical about this at the beginning, thinking this is how they brainwash you and numb you, and make you forget.

Turns out I did forget over time. Sure, this chemical takes aways the lows, and the highs, but it also makes me say ""meh"" about the injustices about the world.

Can I do anything about it? I guess not. There is truth to this and I just need to live life and find a job, and not be paralyzed. But weed makes me question these things; and this is bad for the system we live in. Society needs good little cogs in the machine.

Weed has always been a psychedelic for me in strong doses, especially after doing LSD and shrooms, but even after the first time I tried it. It's a state of mind and thinking that I enjoy, a state of analyzing the world. I'm connected to my emotions while on it. I also tend to see the bullshit propaganda that's pushed on the TV and media jump out at me so much easier when I'm high.",89,1553,16,295,1
2021-01-04 03:19:07,Psychonautics isn't limited to drug use.,"I've noticed some people aren't aware of this, but psychonautics deals with altered states of consciousness and experience as a whole; it isn't limited to drug use. Meditation and sensory deprivation are two common ones many here are already interested in. Lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis, and astral projecting as well. Sleep deprivation, hell even exercise or reading could be considered psychonautic techniques. 

This isn't limited to drug use. There are near-infinite perceptual alterations we can explore. Learning and acquiring new information is an easy way to actively shape your perception. It isn't as noticeable as drug use, but it shifts your perception of reality nonetheless.  

I'd even argue that sensory augmentation is a form of psychonautics. Things like magnet implants, which opens your mind up to the electromagnetic fields surrounding you and allows you to tell which metals are magnetic almost instantly. Even things that temporarily alter your taste buds, and therefore your perception of taste, could arguably be considered a form of psychonautics. 

I'd personally consider mental illness a form of psychonautics as well. Psychosis, schizo-spectrum disorders, ASD, Bipolar, ADHD, HPPD. Anything that causes visual alterations, even if it isn't a psychotic disorder (like VSS or ocular migraines) synesthesia, and Acquired Savant Syndrome (this one man with ASS was literally able to see the math that makes up the universe) 

All alterations to our waking baseline experience are psychonautic techniques.",40,1532,6,231,1

2020-08-28 08:42:50,"I am a high-functioning sufferer of a rare brain anomaly. I have generalized PTSD and have found HUGE medicinal/therapeutic aid in psilocybin, whereas antidepressants are not designed with malformed brains in mind. I want to become a devoted/dedicated advocate.","I am going to summarize things as quickly as possible in order to make this post most easily accessible, and then I will happily elaborate deeper in the comments! I just meandered for too long the last time I posted about this and I think that prevented many people from delving into it. 

**Backstory**

I have a strange set of circumstances. Very strange. I was born with **rhombencephalosynapsis**, a rare brain anomaly. This entails the fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres and the partial or entire absence of the **vermis** (in my case, it's the entire absence). This can be coupled with other malformations in the brain, and in my case, it is. The vermis is heavily associated with posture and locomotion while the *cerebellum* itself is related to a host of things-- fine movement, equilibrium, motor learning, attention, language, emotional control. Some other parts of my brain that are malformed are the **medial temporal lobes** (visual memory, emotion association, language comprehension), the **hippocampus** (short-term to long-term memory conversion and spatial memory), and most crucially in my opinion, the **amygdala** (center of emotional and fear response). 

Here's the backstory about how I came to learn these circumstances about myself. I had to get a cosmetic cranial surgery when I was a kid for having a misshapen head and I had involuntary body movements, the most crucial of which was in my head and neck. I would roll my head around in figure eights and find it really hard to keep it still like an intense, pervading tic. I was also really stunted as far as coordination goes-- I was terrible at sports and things that required motor control like biking, as well as fine motor control like penmanship. Other than that though, my parents weren't really all that worried because I was intellectually and behaviorally overachieving, and also doing quite well for myself socially. At the time, I really just had such childlike confidence that I didn't waste time thinking about my differences-- I just adapted to them naturally and worked through them. Do I definitely remember having a lot of anxiety at the time? For sure. And did I recognize the fact that I was different and ponder that a bit beyond the level at which an elementary school kid should have been? Yes. But generally, things were not very bad. I was a smart and nice kid-- I may have come across as different and gotten a lot of laughs in some aspects being as clumsy and uncoordinated as I was, and my tic raised quite a few questions, but people really didn't think of me as someone to be pitied-- by the age of four, I was able to point out basically any animal in my animal kingdom encyclopedia based on their classifications. I was a really promisingly smart kid and I did know that. And plenty of people were quite fond of me. My anxiety just prevented me from doing everything I wanted to do with my life and my differences got me into some situations where people were impatient and not understanding with me-- it was perhaps because I was so smart and functional that people didn't see me as handicapped and treat me as such. 

When I was like 4-6, my parents started tasking me with keeping my head straight-- which I proved I was capable of doing if I was really concentrating on it. The problem was that there were a million other things to concentrate on and I would often lose focus and just start letting it flow like natural. Obviously, my parents pursued some MRIs and we got in contact with a neurologist. In 2007, shortly before my seventh birthday, I was diagnosed with **rhombencephalosynapsis**-- at the time, there were 250-500 cases in the medical literature. The most recent update on that I've seen puts the number around 1000 and says that it's likely there are more cases that are undiagnosed, but there is very little out there about it. I was lucky for sure! Some of these people have rhombencephalosynapsis coupled with hydrocephalus and other terrible congenital messes to live with. Many people with my condition live mentally and physically incapacitated with frequent self-injurious involuntary movements, seizures, spasms, strokes, and an array of health problems until early death. My neurologists all say I'm on pace to live a completely normal life. At the time, in 2007, when I was diagnosed, the first high-functioning person with the disorder had only been diagnosed in 2005. My neurologist literally said just not to look too deeply into it because there wasn't much information out there and it was all pretty grim and that I seemed to be fine. I was told that I'd have bad penmanship and coordination and that I was missing part of my brain related to that, but oddly that was it. I mean, when I got the diagnosis I might have heard words like ""amygdala"" and ""hippocampus"" from the neurologist's mouth at the age of 6, but somehow my parents never hammered home the fact that I had all these impairments, perhaps just because of how outstandingly high-functioning I was seemingly to the contrary of them, or maybe just because my neurologist failed to hammer home to them the significance of these other malformations. After all, he was so unprepared when he walked in to evaluate us that he had to wing it and log onto the internet to save himself. 

Anyway, where do the mushrooms come in? Basically, all I was given to deal with my problems was a ""You're lucky"" and a ""get over it."" I had an overall good childhood as far as friends and family go. I never had a shortage of people around. But I didn't have much of a support system. I partially did that to myself by not confiding with my parents about how dramatic my fear response was, and about how it made me feel disabled to be so much worse at the other kids at some physical activities, and how my diagnosis ultimately led to a downward spiral for the next twelve years. It was a period of immense confusion where I really failed to understand my differences and how they apply on a neurological level-- what was beyond my control and not, what I deserved to feel silly about and not. The fact that people saw me as a regular functioning human being meant that they could be rather cruel about things I was just expected to be doing. Gym class was a hell, and school as a whole started to become a hell when middle school came around. The scene was changing and becoming oriented around popularity and I was still an imaginative kid at heart still shaking his head. I felt different and like I didn't fit in, especially because I ended up moving schools. I became depressed from all of my anxiety, and it led to isolation for the most part. Even in high school when I started to gain some friends and go to parties and when girls started to find me attractive, things were still grim because I had this confusion about the person I was that subconsciously underlay. I developed a heavy dependence on marijuana and started drinking myself silly, which would just be so messy and horrible because my brain clearly sustains alcohol abnormally. I would completely lose myself and get borderline demonic. Part of the time, this drinking was done on Prozac, which zombified me during high school. Around 2015, though, I was able to ""conquer"" my head-shaking tic, which had been dramatically decreasing over the years. It still exists obviously, and it is noticeable sometimes when I get anxious, but it actually pervades constantly, it's just that I now subconsciously know how to pawn off the movements as normal head jerks and whatnot. 

It was not until I was 19, literally less than a year ago, that I got up the courage to delve into my neurological records. Prior to then, I had always thought that what I didn't know didn't hurt me-- I didn't want to be affiliated with any of those shortcomings. This is when I learned about my amygdala, hippocampus, and medial temporal lobes and started to try to get savvy with the knowledge of my condition. I was also beginning to immerse myself in meditation at the time, which was forcing me to explore my subconscious and the things that I had been keeping bottled and repressed. What ended up contributing to that even more so? The psilocybin mushrooms of course! 

**Mushrooms**

Psilocybin helped me in so many ways. I feel so detached from all of my suffering when I am on it and meditating. I had been interested in psychedelics since 2017, and all this time, I had been exploring their ancient association with religion and science, as well as their link to psychiatry and therapy before they got banned in the '60s. Mushrooms helped me diagnose the fact that I was suffering from PTSD, which I mistakenly identified as bipolar. Actually, I'm not certain whether it's PTSD or CPTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder). PTSD often entails malformations in the amygdala and hippocampus, but CPTSD often entails flashbacks related to intense emotional distress rather than more physically traumatic situations. But basically, people with malformed amygdalas are more likely to suffer from heavy, visceral relationships with the past, which I never would have known had I not realized how much the label ""PTSD"" applied to me while meditating on mushrooms, which prompted me to do my proper research. Mushrooms have, of course, been observed to have enormous value in treating trauma and PTSD. Psilocybin makes me feel less delusional-- like I'm seeing more of the world for what it is free of my insecurities. It makes me realize how off my perceptions are based on the fact that my fear response has not been properly developing, as I have been suffering from a handicap all this time that I have expected to get over completely on my own without even having the sufficient information defining myself. I am able to see things from the point-of-view of destiny-- not necessarily that destiny is a real, observable factor at play in the metaphysics of the universe, but just rather that belief is a psychologically positive thing and that destiny keeps people going in dire situations like mine. I believe that it is my destiny to be an advocate for the legalization and medicalization of psilocybin and other herbal and holistic remedies. 

Antidepressants had absolutely zombified me! I don't know if I believe they're good for people at all, but I certainly know that they're not good for me, someone with a malformed brain. I would feel much more comfortable using medicine that has the universality of emerging from the earth. I refuse to believe that there is any good reason I shouldn't be taking mushrooms when they ease my horrible PTSD. I feel like a lot of my life and youth have passed me by. I endured so much confusion for 20 years not having the proper information to develop to my full potential. I was adapting to my situation until my diagnosis sent me into a deep, isolated depression that I now have such heavy PTSD from that it causes dissociative episodes. There was so much innocent, careless, childlike fun that I had to miss out on because I carried this condition with me constantly and had to develop a hyper-vigilance about my flaws to the point of perfectionism in order to properly play the part of ""normal."" It even says that the repression of a tic can cause a lot of tension and that it can be better to just let it be-- seriously, how did none of my family or my neurologist ever supply me with this information? 

My life just feels like a lie-- I have never known the extent of my disabilities, and it was horrifying constantly trying to prevent anything embarrassing or abnormal from happening. I am just so bitter about my trauma in spite of myself, but the flashbacks are just so visceral and confusing! Plus, I probably did damage to my brain drinking and not fully understanding the possible consequences, and mushrooms are allowing me to not drink a lot of alcohol with ease! I never thought I'd be able to handle a healthy relationship with alcohol, but I now feel like I can have one or two drinks once in a while without having to get blotto like I used to. I don't want to keep meandering, but I should be allowed to eat a goddamn vegetable that grows from the ground to build new neural pathways! Psilocybin has been observed to do constructive aid for amygdalas and have promising results with the treatment of PTSD. I will stop at nothing to advocate for legalization and medicalization. My voice will be heard. 

**Next time, it will be much more elegantly so and with a little bit more structure. Today, I just wanted to get everything out there as quickly as possible to open up the doors to discussion. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Psilocybin is the future of psychiatry. The ability to explore consciousness, memory, and time is absolutely riveting, perhaps especially so for myself because of my visceral relationship with the past and because I have an educational, historical, psychological, spiritual, and philosophical background. I could write for hours and hours about my research, observations, and analyses on mushrooms, and believe me, I will. I will have to get it all out there to properly advocate. People on this forum who talk about the ""tolerance"" of mushrooms are clearly using them in more of a recreational fashion than a performance-enhancing, psychiatric, therapeutic, meditative, or entheogenic fashion, because I have found that my most analytical and introspective trips come after I have taken small amounts of mushrooms a few days in a row. I challenge the idea that this is a negative thing unless you have not properly psychologically steeled yourself for such a thing with sufficient scientific, psychological, and historical research.**",261,13679,39,2365,1

I've been listening to a lot of modern hip-hop, and I came to the conclusion it might be altering my consciousness for the worse without me even noticing really

For example a very common theme among lyrics is ego-centric braggadosia (I have this, I do that etc..) and also it's like they're all dissing/taking shots at some imaginary dude or something, for example they will randomly be like ""I fucked your bitch"", ""your a broke ass bitch"", ""you ain't shit"" etc.. stuff like that. Like who the fuck are they even talking to? Lmao (I had this funny random thought that there's actually one poor random dude out there who all these rappers and their lines are referring to and he's just helplessly being slaughtered by all these rappers and they all fucked his girlfriend and shit lol)

Anyway, I understand the appeal and I get it... its supposed to boost your ego and make you feel like you're ""the shit"" because you're supposed to identify with the rapper and what their saying or whatever.. but I feel like (ans maybe this is just me) subconsciously the opposite actually happens and your brain interprets it as the insults being directed at you (they are worded that way after all... can your brain really differentiate between someone talking to you and listening to a song?) And as a results can make you feel insignificant and depressed?

And also just in general comparing yourself to other people too much, whether you are on the winning or losing end has negative effects either way. It feels like blatant overcompensation to me.

Any thoughts on the topic welcome

Edit:I think a few of you are misinterpreting this as I'm not aware of positive hip-hop or all I listen to is ego-centric hip-hop. That's not true lol. I also listen to J. Cole, YBN Cordae, Kota tha Friend, Felly, etc. And I also have a wide taste in musical genre it's not like I sit around *all* day listening to lil pump. It's just an observation

On Monday early AM after our Sunday football party, my fianc√© had a MASSIVE seizure in bed. I called the paramedics, went to the ER, where a CT scan revealed what nobody ever ever wants to hear. He had a massive brain tumor.

I say had because on Thursday he had emergency brain surgery to remove it. Thank the divine spirit, healing energies, angels, ancestors, and the gods of old and new - he came out of this 8 hour surgery with full motor function, cognitive ability, and memory. He won't need any rehab. My big ass man is a fucking truck, and I am so goddamn proud of him. 

This **would have** killed him, and the seizure was a sort of blessing bc some people just die. It's lucky I was there for it or he wasn't driving or working on a ladder or in an attic (he's a contractor).

We are currently transferring out of the ICU into a regular room, and hope to go home early next week. I've been staying with him 24/7 here at the hospital. He is grouchy af, which is understandable of course, pretty doped up on morphine.

His tumor is unrelated to our drug use. He likely has had the mass slowly growing for many, many years (very probable it is benign). It'd just gotten large enough to cause brain swelling, hence the seizure. 

But I'd like to write a partial farewell to you friends, as I love this community. I'll still follow, but we will be taking at least years' of a break from drugs.

2018-11-05 07:52:11,Last night I did DMT for the first time... 3 times.,"My room mate and I did it together. First he smokes it and I watched over him Incase anything was to go wrong. He laid down after smoking it, eyes closed and has the biggest smile on his face for 10 minutes. He came back and had such a positive experience it removes any worry I had. I then smoked it and went to this ever so familiar realm of beautiful geometric shapes. I was pumped with love by other worldly entities and reassured of my purpose. I asked how soon I should visit again they said ASAP. We discussed our experiences then he smoked it again. Had a similar experience but less intense than first. We discussed it. I smoked it again. Found myself back in that  same higher realm. This time was explained that anything I want can be received I must only ask for it. We had enough to blast off one more time each. He smoked his 3rd time. Went away and was smiling but then near the end came back to say things got dark. He said the entities told him he has to share the deep dark secret he had been harboring for years. He told me that he had been abused as a child and that he never told anyone until now after their advice. He felt a huge weight lifted. I then smoked my 3rd time. I never believed in chakras but I felt all of mine open and electricity pulse through out my body. I laid down eyes closed. It was pure black for over a minute. I thought maybe I‚Äôm not gona blast off? Then suddenly I‚Äôm transported to this place I can only describe as a soul factory. Beautiful infinite fractals and souls everywhere being reincarnated into bodies. I see the faces of every person I have ever met. I simultaneously relive all past moments and future moments. I am show then shocking truth that this is all but my own creation some insane dream. But not that the trip is the dream but reality itself is my creation. That I am the creator of the universe and that I am every other person on earth. We are all one consciousness merely spread through a billion different life forms. I‚Äôm assured that I have been reincarnated infinite times and will continue to be. I‚Äôm assured that everything that happens to me and will happen to me is my own design. The way this is all visual presented is so beautiful and stunning that I begin weeping like a baby. I finally return to my body after what felt like thousands of years. I struggle to explain to my room mate that we are all one. He simply nods and says I do believe that‚Äôs correct. 10/10 would recommend DMT. It was the most positive enlightening experience I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs very similar to what I experience on a heroic dose of mushrooms but it all happened in 10 minutes rather than multiple hours. Mind fucking blown. But yeah you are me and I‚Äôm you and I‚Äôll see all you fucker back at the soul factory sometime in the next 50 years or so. ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èüíïüíï",51,2810,11,535,1

2020-08-13 08:13:33,5G trip report - I realized that society is going down a dark path and you need to be ready,"Here is what I realized recently on my 5g dried mushroom trip,

Trip was taken alone in darkness at a hotel at 12:30 am.

I fasted 48 hours before the trip and did a salt flush.

took them raw, no grind, no og, just as is.

It was extreme.

this post is my realization, advice i wrote to myself and advice that you can take if you choose too.

\---------

‚Äúwin the decade not the day‚Äù one of my favorite quotes.

You must understand that we become what we think about. In our current society, slavery was not abolished it was replaced. The slavery is mental slavery. You are being controlled through your mind.

What you think you become ‚Äì buddha

The world has gone digital and as 2021 approaches, we are going digital for good, say goodbye to the physical world.

The reason social media, porn, Netflix, tinder, sex and all these other vices are being portrayed at such a high rate is because they want to control you through temptations and through dopamine,.

they means the elite, the nwo. the people who run this world. everything is planned nothing is by chance.

Now you will be a slave to your mind going forward. They are controlling what you think about and what occupies your mind.

Now, Through studies social media and Instagram has been referenced to being similar to a slot machine. Your need for self-acceptance in this world through likes will make you invisible because that‚Äôs what most people think about these days. And if that‚Äôs all you allow to occupy your mind, you become an addict to dopamine.When you get your dopamine hit from those Instagram likes, or facebook likes, or porn, netflix. Your desire to do something with your life is very low because you dopamine receptors are off.

Now , Do you want to reach age 90 and be in a state of regret that you could have become something great but chose not to because you failed to acquire knowledge on how your brain functions and who you are as a human.

Regret is poison.

You start realizing , Why work towards something greater when I can get my dopamine hit easily if I post a photo on instagram for an example, or post a video, or expose my self to sexual images.

Now , Most people think about what should I post, did he reply to my dm, did she reply to my dm, what tv show should I watch. There is nothing wrong with having an instagram and using it in a disciplined fashion with PURPOSE but most people do not. It is their source of validation to feel some sense of self-worth. They care what others think. These are the thoughts that are occupying your mind and you are pretty much on a hamster wheel never ending. Your constant need for validation is hindering your ability to get on your shit and be the best version of yourself and do something with your life because death is coming. We are all going to face death and don‚Äôt die without having realized your true potential.

Instead of sitting around, wondering and pondering about what you should post, what you should watch, the negative news that causes fear in you, if you don‚Äôt think it affects you , trust me it does, mentally and physically you get weak. You are a vibrational being first.

Now, i realized, Heres what you could do, you could occupy your mind with different thoughts, thoughts of what book should I read tomorrow, how can I improve my business, how can I improve my relationship with my wife/husband. You have a magnetic field to you, what you allow to occupy your mind you become drawn to, we are creatures of focus.

Where is your focus ?

Do you see how disciplined thoughts lead to a better life, disciplined thoughts cause clarity and focus. You are what you think about. So discipline your thoughts.

Here is a quote I live by, when it comes down to disciplining our thoughts just know that through thoughts you are controlled, your mind is your greatest asset. The war is on your mind.

‚Äú Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.‚Äù George Bernard Shaw.

=====

Now here is where the trip got really interesting‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Social media is a different reality, the online world is a different world.

We have 3 worlds

1. We have the spiritual world
2. We have the physical world
3. We have the digital world.

You are leaving the physical for the digital.

That‚Äôs why they are introducing virtual reality. Virtual reality will be way better for you than this physical world that you will be in the digital world and hate the physical. Instead of having a sex and forming bonds with your significant other, you will hop on the vr. Its easier and faster.

&#x200B;

*Its scary to think about it.*

&#x200B;

Now , The world we are entering is the digital world. Society is trying to take you away from the physical world so that you can focus on the digital world only and the digital world is a world of temptation and overstimulation and over load of information and half of the information you are exposed to online has nothing to do with your journey towards self-growth. the digital world is a place where you need to have the utmost self-discipline because you have access to everything, literally at your fingertips. You can get food anytime you want, you can get sex anytime you want, you can watch anything you want, you can read anything you want.

Now ,they are giving you everything so you can destroy yourself.

How else do you expect them to keep the sheep in line, do you want to be a sheep like the rest , I‚Äôm guessing no. so it is your duty to know where the future is going,

win the decade not the day. Own your mind.

Now , The major key to leading a disciplined life come 2021 and so on, is to control your thoughts. we need to Be extremely disciplined what we give our attention to. Not everyone deserves your attention, not everyone on instagram deserves your attention, not everyone on youtube deserves your attention, not even the news deserves your attention. Your attention is gold. Wherever your attention goes your energy flows there as well. You have access to everything at your fingertips that‚Äôs a good thing if you have self-discipline.

It is a bad thing if you don‚Äôt.

\---------------------------------

*‚ÄúSelf-discipline begins with the mastery of your thoughts. If you don't control what you think, you can't control what you do. Simply, self-discipline enables you to think first and act afterward.‚Äù - Napolean Hill*

2022-05-18 06:10:06,72 year old still uses mushrooms once in a while but ...,"But I can't say my motivation to swallow 5 capsules of ground up golden teachers this morning was to explore my mind or to deal with spiritual questions.  I haven't tripped on mushrooms for about a year, but I thought it was time.

I guess the fact that I am still occasionally using psychedelics at my age is commendable.  But I am not searching for answers at this stage of my life.  What I am doing is doing things that increase the chances that my brain will continue to function satisfactorily  until the day I take my last breath.  Along with what I think will be 2 or 3 trips I have increased my exercise program big time over the last year.  I did this because exercise is probably the best long term way to improve cognitive health.  But so is occasional tripping on psychedelics.

My trip this morning was surprisingly strong.  I think the reason for that is by swallowing the capsules I was ingesting the plant directly.  The tea I used previously wasn't quite as effective.

When you become as old as me I suggest you remember to give your brain a little stimulation by using pyschedicics to create new neurons.  Think of it as a brain tuneup.",56,1155,12,210,1
2021-04-21 20:30:46,I did half a tab yesterday and realized why psychedelics (esp lsd) are illegal.,"Because people would realize they are ALL being had and there would be murder in the streets. 

We are being had by a monetary system that enslaves us. 

We are being had by employers that exploit our labour.


We are being had by corporations that STEAL OUR IDENTITIES and then have the balls to sell them back to us through consumption of meaningless goods and services. 

We are being had by our partners who waste our time in meaningless relationships and rob us of our years.

We are being had by our friends who use us to feel better about themselves. 

We are being had by our parents who stifle our growth in the name of protecting us.

We are being had by religion that robs us blind fiscally AND MORE IMPORTANTLY SPIRITUALLY.

Keep your eyes peeled people. There are grifters ALL AROUND YOU. People riding YOUR coattails to meet their ends. 

If we want freedom then free markets ARE THE ONLY WAY OUT. Not the duplicitous tyrannical enslaved capitalist system we are in now under the guise of a free market. **EVERY INTERACTION YOU HAVE IS BASED ON THE IDEA OF FREE MARKETS**. From your interpersonal relationships to your job. If free markets truly existed currently the way politicians and corporations would have you believe, then those very entities would not exist presently by their own logic. 

#A FREE MARKET IS WHERE GOOD AND BAD IDEAS ALIKE COME TO LIVE AND DIE. THIS IS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO SALVATION.


**EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET NEEDS TO BE EMPOWERED IN THEMSELVES AND THEIR OWN PERSONAL BARGAINING ABILITY IN ALL LEVELS OF LIFE** 

Freedom isn't free. There are dogs waiting AT YOUR DOOR to come and take what's yours. Free yourself. Do not play their game. SAY NO TO EVERYTHING THAT IS ILLOGICAL.

2021-06-28 19:20:23,Saddest fucking trip,"We're in the middle of the biggest heatwave ever recorded and I wasn't doing anything so decided to take 2 tabs and go swimming at the river yesterday. Everything was great until I saw birds gasping for air unable to fly, had friends who lost chickens and read of people's dogs dying in the heat. And today is supposed to be hotter at 117F in the pacific northwest. 

It sank in that there was a real chance maybe not today, maybe not for 10 or 20 years, but eventually we could lose a lot of the ""wild"" part of the wilderness. We'll be sitting in climate controlled units looking out at a sterile environment watching mass die offs of birds and squirrels and beavers and various critters you never realized how much you appreciate seeing until they're gone, unequipped to cope, and it's beyond disturbing.  Oceans and forests with a fraction of the wildlife living in them, their magic lost. 

I traded a house in the city for a house on a river in the woods, but even the river is mostly empty, you can catch fish a few months of the year but not year round. The mountain with glaciers that feed the river melted enough yesterday to turn the water brown from increased waterflow just overnight. It was a beautiful blue yesterday as I swam and when I woke up this morning it's pure brown. Looking out the window there's no signs of life as everything is struggling to function, bird feeders abandoned, water bowls untouched, and while it's temporary it's a fucking sad glimpse of what's to come. 

And I'd also like to say the thought of people sitting in prison for LSD is as crazy as people in prison for pot. It's not for everyone but it's also not hurting anyone and it makes you brutally aware of the alarm bells you never stop to think about too much, in a powerful and deeply personal way.",20,1797,3,330,1
2021-06-12 05:31:53,I feel like as a society more emphasis should be placed on teaching people how to be good parents,"The more I trip the more I realise that everyone is just a product of their environment and situation and an enormous part of that are parents. So much of the development of our brain happens when we are children and what people become is generally a direct product of the ones who raised them. 

I see generational trauma repeating itself in my family and friends, parents who were abused and think well it happened to me and ‚ÄúI tUrNeD oUt FiNe‚Äù so I‚Äôll abuse my kids too. And then when most people want to have kids, who do they go to for parenting advice? Their parents of course. The cycles continue and rarely do people break out of them. Since I‚Äôve started taking psychs and recognising these patterns and trying to make a change, I‚Äôm seeing change happen not just down the generations but also up too. Since I‚Äôve grown and matured and stopped feeding into the bullshit cycles my parents have grown and matured too. I‚Äôm not taking all the credit but it really only takes a few people to start making change for others to mirror that behaviour or follow suite.

Maybe this is obvious to everyone on this sub but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve only realised recently. 

I would say the vast majority of people don‚Äôt recognise the unhealthy parenting habits of their parents or themselves. Everyone‚Äôs just doing their best and what they think is right but the sad truth is often what they‚Äôre doing is incredibly harmful to their children.

If we placed more emphasis on teaching new parents how to raise kids safely it could have huge benefits for society I feel. I know different cultures have different ideas and i by no means have any idea how this could realistically be implemented effectively. But it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been thinking about and would love to hear others thoughts on it, both for and against.",97,1803,19,320,1

2020-05-12 19:58:07,I would like to argue that new Netflix documentary is borderline garbage,"         Edit3* it's cool it's got this attention and a lot of people see where I'm coming from. I'm definitely done with this thread because theres to many opinions and a lot of butthurt people that dont know where I'm coming from or kinda do but want mushies to go mainstream that bad. Despite some great opinions I still disagree for the most part and dont believe this is a good way for mushies to go mainstream. Mushies shouldnt really be side by side with acid either. Maybe I'm just very conservative however I think this substance is sacred and shouldnt be approached in a funny joking way because that will subliminally enter first timers minds. Let's be real, this substance is about removing the brainwashing from the system but it seems like a lot of people rather still be washed up and I believe Big media will try to change the image of psychedelics and lower the bar to give it a less effect on the individual. I dont see how that doc gives any purity to removing the brainwashing. That doc just opens the door for people to continue to lower the bar and take advantage of psychedelics instead of talk about its true purpose. People will say shit like oh but your truth may be different etc... but that's bs in my opinion. Maybe you just never seen the truth. The eye in the sky. Back to our roots. The scam of the system and being an economical unit of society. In my opinion that doc still wants you to be a consumer and a unit and it doesnt stand for what psychedelics are really about which is a revolution. Thanks for listening and sorry for my arrogance ! Peace out home slices and stop being bitch ass consumers or remind yourself how much you are consuming everyday and maybe start generating instead of consuming
   
 Edit2* I also want to mention why it may appear I have anger. I have years of experience with mushrooms and some acid to. Ever since my journey started its always been about expanding my knowledge and understanding and truth, it's very deep and personal as it would be with anyone else on this journey of discovery. That doc is a huge blow to the actual tripping community that understands this substance. That doc lowers the bar. If they actually cared about psychedelics they would have done more research to see where the bar currently is set amongst the actual psychedelic HEROS not some god damn lame celebrities that tripped 1 time and are sharing a random ass story. This doc subliminally enters the mind of people and now this is their reference to psychedelics. Its insulting because its just trying to take advantage for profit, it doesn't care. It's not about introducing or opening new doors.
   
    
 Edit* I would like to mention I'm upset with this sub in general. I actually put some effort with my thoughts and this has been getting a lot of downvotes with none of those downvoters actually speaking up. I would like to know why you disagree before you try to silence me.... And please dont take this as being hostile. I dont want to be your enemy. I just feel like I am speaking the truth.
   
It's such a down grade when it comes to the realm of psychedelics. The trailer its self says something like 'watching this will make you feel like your on psychedelics' which is essentially making people 'feel' like they've already had the experience so they will never try it. I knew it was *garbage* just from the trailer.  
   
I didnt actually watch the whole thing because frankly I dont care about celebrities. I rather listen to someone like Terrence McKenna describe the experiences. It's obviously made to draw in 'trendy' type of people.  
   
It almost feels like a joke. Its just sad to see that image of it when psychedelics go back thousands of years and have such deep profound meaning and experiences through alternate realities. It's not educational in the way it should be. It doesnt really raise conscious thinking. It's more like to take advantage of the rise of psychedelics. This is not really opening the door to psychedelics, if anything its closing some doors.  
   
  
I also notice theres this exaggeration on not to look into the mirror when your tripping. Again garbage that takes away the real consciousness of this experience. You telling me you guys never looked into mirror and through your eyes into your pineal gland or inside your gut? That's where it's at my dudes. Look in the mirror and really freaking digest who you are and what you are, you can see through the eyes and into something much deeper,  theres so much meaning here and it's such a deep experience, possibly one of the best you can get out of psychedelics. Cant believe they turned that into a joke of not to look in the mirror. However I do understand that theres a lot of people who cant handle looking in the mirror because the experience is to deep for them to process but they dont properly educate about this.   
    
I wont keep rambling because my post has some negative vibes however it comes from the negative connotation I got from the doc.      
   
   
What I'm trying to say I guess is that psychedelics are SO MUCH more than that and that doc is almost designed in a way that closes the door of curiosity for people by making them think watching that is all the experience really is so theres nothing new to imagine etc..",72,5295,12,942,1

2020-11-08 12:21:03,Don't let your advancement down this path make you take yourself and life too seriously,"Don't let metaphysics and the profound, and what you learn about it become your identity. This the ego taking hold and putting you in another box.

Don't assume following a path occult and unknown to most makes you need to act serious and stern, there's a reason humour is associated with Buddhism. Laugh at yourself often, laugh at everything. Don't get wrapped up in the mysteriousness of all this, understand nothing must be serious.

Don't plague people with information about the nature of reality, don't over do it. Don't become the musician who can't ever put the instrument down. Remain a standard person but on the inside keep exploring and evolving. Let the lessons you've learnt to prove themselves in the little things, like how you remain patient in difficult times, or how you maintain an attitude of kindness and humility.

There are so many pitfalls going down this path. I have fallen down plenty so far, thought I'd just shine light on where they are so perhaps someone won't have to. That's how evolution should work, it's how it does work in nature, we are meant to learn from one another to keep improving beyond. Though I know sometimes it is necessary to make mistakes in order to truly learn not to again.

All the best

Actually, one other abstract lesson I've learnt. If you are someone who obsesses over someone you view as great, whether it be some genius author or talented musician, try not to view them as a god. Doing this is ego-driven because it implies that if you attained that state of mastery then you would also be on a pedestal, on the level of a god. Remember to acknowledge that they are just conduits of the divine, the one source. Remember they have just managed to get out of their own way for the light to shine through unhindered. Anyone can do it, so do it!",87,1805,15,322,1
2022-03-12 16:16:26,My friend heard of his father's passing while we were tripping,"Hey

This happened literally 2 hours ago. I don't even know what to say. I'm sharing this because I don't think many people can relate to being on mushrooms while your best friend finds out his father died (and which is exactly why I put my phone on flight mode whenever I trip, I wanna reserve that time for my own consciousness).

So his stepmom called and he looked at the phone and hesitated. He said ""she never calls"". He knew somehow. I have never seen him so serious. He picked up and just started crying soon. I could tell someone had died by his reaction.

It took a bit for him to even speak after the call. Then he told me. Then he said he wanted to just sit in the shower. He lit a candle in there and I just sat with him in the shower. Just being, hardly anything was said and hugging. I think what hurt him even more that his dad's passing is when he called his sister to tell her. She is his baby. She is a lot younger than him, he took care of her a lot. They have a very deep bond. And hearing her cry... Actually I'm crying now when I think of that moment.

So now I'm on a train back to Helsinki where I live, he lives up north. I asked him if I should stay. He said he wants to be alone a bit before his mom is coming over and his ex girlfriend that he is still close with.

He had a troubled relationship with his dad and I can related to that. I'm currently taking therapy with my dad and one thing he said ""the best thing about my son's visits where when I saw his back"" and laughed. I Harbour not negative feelings towards him. It's his way of dealing with his pain which I'm happy to say no longer is part of my pain.

He asked ""why is it hitting me so hard"" (because they were not close) and I just said that he is still your dad. He said tho that his dad had a good heart. And I responded ""of course, everyone does"". We are all children looking for love. I told him about therapy with my dad more and that I think the pain people inflict on others is only coming from their own pain, not from their source, soul you could say if u wanna use that word. I think nobody is guilty, but everybody is responsible. Like ram das said, we are all just walking each other home. Every time someone hurts you it's an opportunity to grow and learn. If you truly understand why people hurt each other there is no need for forgiveness I think. Forgiveness is a natural consequence of understanding in my opinion.

What I also want to express is tell people you love them. Don't wait for someone to die. Call your parents while you still can. And if you can't, you can still forgive them and let love rule. Resentment is poison you drink and only you will get poisoned.

2020-12-11 23:42:35,Albert Hoffman‚Äôs response to ‚ÄúWhat would you say to young people?‚Äù,"‚ÄúWhat I would say would most certainly be: Open your eyes! The doors of perception must be opened. That means these young people must learn by their own experience, to see the world as it was before human beings were on this planet. That is the real problem today, that people live in towns and cities, where everything is dead. This material world, made by humans, is a dead world, and will disappear and die. I would tell the young people to go out into the countryside, go to the meadow, go to the garden, go to the woods. This is a world of nature to which we belong, absolutely. It is the circle of life, of which we are an integral part. Open your eyes, and see the browns and greens of the earth, and the light which is the essence of nature. The young need to become aware of this circle of life, and realize that it is possible to experience the beauty and deep meaning which is at the core of our relation to nature.‚Äù",66,927,11,178,1

2021-04-01 23:53:38,I unfortunately can no longer use psychedelics,"Just wanted to write a commemorative post to my time exploring my consciousness with psychedelics. 

I have recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia. My first episode happened on an MDMA trip, and I now have episodes regularly and even more so when I‚Äôm smoking weed. Because of this, I must give up most psychoactive substances. I have tripped many times on acid and shrooms and I loved exploring all my mind had to offer while on them, but I unfortunately will not be able to do so anymore. I am jealous of all of you who get to continue using these great substances, and I ask you all to not take them for granted. I will probably try to induce similar states of consciousness with mediation in the future in order to further explore. 

On a side note, I have not tried DMT yet. I am hoping that my symptoms will slow down in the future for I will make an exception for DMT. I will probably wait like 10-15 years for that though. Also I realized it was April Fools halfway through writing this so this is not a stupid joke, I just wanted to spread my message. 

Also anyone who has a family history of schizophrenia, please don‚Äôt ignore that. I started tripping way too young and it probably led to me having my schizophrenic symptoms induced earlier and stronger than it would have normally.

Anyways, peace and love to you all. Enjoy the little moments ‚ù§Ô∏è",46,1361,7,248,1

2021-05-22 20:40:39,"""this acid is 100ug bro""","I sold acid for 7 years. Many, many batches went through my hands even though I only sold smaller amounts. And the people who I was getting it from either were the chemists secretly, or knew them personally. Because they'd have powder LSD, liters of liquid LSD, so many sheets that it took up considerable volume... It was a at this hippie commune and it was so great. Every time I went there we would make ""lug jugs"", or ""love jugs"" full of MDMA, a big part of a sheet of acid, ketamine sometimes, alprazolam occasionally, ground mushrooms cocaine, honey all mixed into a jug of whiskey or whatever..  it was crazy. Nobody there knew everyone's real names except for ones that were close to one another. It was essentially a timeless festival, but people lived there. A lot of people lived there. Some friends were in bands and even played there. 

But anyways, I see everyone saying on here all the time like, ""so I took 150ug of LSD"". And what I've learned through all of this is that nobody knows how much LSD is in their dose. Sometimes some sheets it would be like I needed 2-3 hits to really ""get there"". And I always considered that 100ug doses. I didn't really know though. The thing is I'll admit it. I'd get acid and the friends selling it to me(bless their hearts, awesome people, this is not against their personality) would say shit like ""this is 300ug"" or ""this is 100ug of silver quality"" or ""this is needlepoint 250ug"".. etc.. but what I learned through taking it for literal years and giving it to others.. taking it hundreds of times is... 

Nobody knows what they're even talking about. 

LSD varies so much. So. Much. In my experience, WOW blotter and gel tabs are what I would watch out for. I know that the form it is in on paper or on gel tab is a shit representation of what it might be. Obviously that is not a fool proof indicator. I'm not saying that it is. But these are what would seriously blow my mind the most. They could say ""this is 300ug needlepoint"" or ""this is 100ug fluff"". It wouldn't have ended up even mattering, because one hit would be enough to entirely dissect and rebuild your entire personality causing a mind blowing experience that plenty of people were unable to even partially control. 3 hits of some acid would be great but a heavy experience, one hit of something else would feel like an entirely different drug. 

The thing was, they were not different drugs. I tested a lot of my LSD and so did my friends. And these people that we got it from were dead serious about getting LSD to as many people as physically possible. And helping spread out ""planetary dosages"" in order to create waves in culture that would change the world for the better. 

I believe they're doing the right thing. I also am aware of the risks associated with LSD and mental health. It's not for everyone.  But that's not what I'm talking about here.

All I am really saying is that you don't know what the dosage is on your acid. Purity changes it. There are grades of purity. Maybe you're getting a different lysergamide all-together(which has happened to me at least on one occasion, this acid particularly blew my mind and I found out it was ETH-LAD.)

Test your batch. But also try to understand that no matter how trusted your source is, they more than likely have no idea what the dosage is. They can guess. But they don't know. And I see all these stories like ""I took 100ug and this happened"" or ""I took 700ug and this happened"". But it's like those numbers are not correct. ""700ug"" of LSD that is particularly clean does not even feel like ""100ug"" of stuff that is particularly crazy. Sometimes ""100ug"" is way more intense than ""500ug"" of a different batch. 

I seriously have never been able to figure this out. I heard a lot through my time doing all of this. People would say that there is basically a few different purities. I forget the exact order but it is something like(most pure to least pure): needlepoint > silver > violet > fluff > amber 

This must play a crucial role. Because it was usually the stuff sold as ""needlepoint"" where you knew not to even try more than half of a hit or one full hit the first time you'd try it. The word needlepoint, was sort of like slang for us to essentially say ""watch out man, this stuff is that kind of acid that you seriously don't want to fuck with or just sell to any person. One hit causes an entire change in reality""

Was that dosage? Purity? Probably both play a role. Is it your set and setting? Yes. But sometimes it's the acid. There are soooo many variables. Is your day going good so far? Nobody else can tell you that, but you know. Did you want to take acid today or are you just doing it because your friends are? What stage are you at in your life? Did you drink coffee this morning? How many cups? 

All acid is different(some of it can be the same, obviously). These days I don't use it anymore for this reason. I have some in my collection and I haven't sold drugs in a few years. I'll take what I have eventually, because I saved them for specific reasons of liking their clarity. A couple tabs I have I know would make me entirely lose my mind though, and I'm scared of those. I'm also scared of buying acid off of someone, because I won't know how crazy it is until I do it. I actually have just gotten out of a phase of swearing off tripping, due to some negative things going on in my life and being unhappy with myself. But I have been experimenting again after a couple years of self improvement, losing my fear with 4-aco-dmt and 4-ho-met and I just love the consistency of this stuff. It sort of is neat, unexpectedly losing your marbles ENTIRELY on one hit of acid sometimes because you can learn some truly valuable things(given that you are having an at least OK trip and not nightmare fuel of confusion). But it is pretty nice to at least sort of know what to expect. And for that reason I enjoy the consistency of what I am doing with tryptamines right now. 

I'm not saying LSD is bad, it is a wonderful drug with extraordinary capabilities that are not to be underestimated. I love it, and I'm beyond glad that it exists. All I'm trying to say is my personal experience. And I'd really like to hear if any of you have been in the same situation and are willing to talk about it, because it would really be cool to hear maybe someone who was involved in the same sort of scenario that I was, but also has an educated opinion on the matter through experience. Because it has taken hundreds of LSD trips, and years of various batches going through my hands to even really begin to think about the intricacies of the LSD market

2023-03-18 05:59:38,"Five months ago, I had a horrific experience on mushrooms, which made me realize how truly awful my diet was. Today, I am under 200lb for the first time since I was 12 years old.","Last October, I drank 5g of Golden Teachers in a tea. I was tripping on a whim (which is the absolute worst thing you can do with a dose that high,) and I'd eaten TWO cans of Pringles beforehand. My stomach felt horrible the entire trip, until I vomited up the smooth orange sludge of my poor decision-making. I felt the full gravity of what my diet was doing to my body- I've always found comfort in junk food and would resort to binge-eating during stressful periods of my life (this trip was during one such period.)  

As I laid on the couch in the fetal position, my entire brain screaming in agony, I remembered having the thought: ""The food you are eating is going to kill you slowly and painfully. You should just kill yourself now and spare yourself the suffering.""  

This was the thought loop I went through for God knows how long. I focused with every ounce of determination I had to just stay on the couch and ride this one out. I told myself- SWORE to myself that I'd get on a diet and take it seriously if I could just get out of this horrifying experience.  

The next day, I bought chicken and broccoli. I planned on eating healthy all week, and eating whatever I wanted during the weekends. This worked fine during November, but I slipped pretty considerably in December. I remembered how much I hated myself during my trip, and how my binge-eating was an expression of that self-hatred. I needed to treat myself with love for once, so I doubled-down on my commitment. I've been on a Keto diet since late January, and have lost an increasingly noticable amount of weight since.  

When I was twelve, I hit 200lb. Then I stopped stepping on the scale, until I was weighed in gym class at seventeen. I was 300lb. Three. Hundred. Pounds. I flirted with diets here and there and eventually lost about 80lb before gaining most of the weight back in 2020. I think part of me accepted that I'd never be under 200lb again. Now at 25, I've finally made the commitment to myself. I'm not done yet, but I honestly didn't think I'd get this far. I don't know for certain if I'd be where I am now without that terrifying trip, but I doubt it. I feel so happy having to buy new clothes and having to tighten my belt even more each week.  

I hope everyone here who's going through a rough spot because of self-hatred is able to find the courage to love themselves and to do a loving act for themselves. You need to treat yourself like a human being. If you're your own worst enemy, then show your enemy compassion, because love is stronger than hatred.",178,2556,35,471,1
2020-07-15 02:53:34,Low dose of mushrooms before a run,"I'm a pretty avid runner, and a rather amateur psychonaut. I took about 1.5 grams of dried mushrooms. About an hour passed and I didn't really feel anything. So I laced up my running shoes and headed out to a nearby trail in my neighborhood. About 10 minutes into my run, the mushrooms kicked in. The sun was low on the horizon and created the most amazing light as it poked through the trees. Everything looked so green and lush. It was breathtaking. 

&#x200B;

As I ran, I really felt connected to the ground. I could feel all these tiny little changes in the ground beneath me. I could feel my feet adapting as the angle of incline or decline changed. The birds and the wind moving the leaves was super loud and intense. I could smell the dust as I ran, and the sweetness of freshly cut grass nearby. I could really feel the breeze all around me and as it made contact with my body as I ran. If I really concentrated, I swear I could hear by heart beating.

&#x200B;

It was a pretty intense experience. All my senses were heightened. I noticed all these little things along the trail that I never noticed before. I appreciated all the things around me. I definitely want to give this a try again when the weather is a little cooler. I think it would be awesome during the fall when the leaves are changing colors.",34,1318,7,246,1
2020-07-12 18:35:45,Some Psychedelic Movies Every Psychonaut Needs To See,"Here‚Äôs a small list of some trippy and psychedelic movies I think everyone should see, especially fellow psychonauts.

Waking Life (Richard Linklater) - An animated philosophical film about dreams, life, and who you are. One of the greats.

The Tree of Life (Terence Malik) - God, this movie is breathtaking. The birth of the cosmos scene never ceases to give me chills.

House (Nobuhiku Obayashi) - There are no words for this one, this movie is nothing short of insane.

Climax (Gaspar No√®) - I‚Äôve seen some people mention Enter the Void on here so I thought I‚Äôd shout out Climax instead, but definitely watch Enter the Void as well it is incredible. This movie is incredible disturbing, as it follows a group of dancers spiralling into a collective psychosis after being dosed with LSD. Do not watch high, but definitely do watch it.

It‚Äôs Such A Beautiful Day (Hertzfeldt) - This experimental animated film is one of the best out there, and it seems few people talk about it. We take a journey through a man named Bill‚Äôs mind as it and his identity completely collapse due to an unknown disease.

Mandy (Cosmatos) - This movie kicks ass, Nicholas Cage completely kills it in this one. This movie is dark, dreary, intensely colourful and fucking awesome. Check it out.

Yellow Submarine (Dunning) - The classic. Seeing this in theatres with a trip and a half that‚Äôs for sure. Some classic psychedelic rock, some amazing experimental animation, what‚Äôs not to love?

Fear and loathing in Las Vegas (Gilliam) - Shouldn‚Äôt need to say much about this one, you guys have probably all seen it. But if you haven‚Äôt, definitely do.

Belladonna of Sadness (Yamamoto) - This movie is really underrated. This movie features some incredible animation for the time it was released. Warning though, there is a pretty brutal rape scene and a lot of sexual scenes, so be prepared for that and definitely see this film.

The Holy Mountain (Jodorowsky) - Couldn‚Äôt not put this on the list. The all time classic ‚Äúwatch while high movie‚Äù. Zoom back, camera!

2019-01-10 17:46:47,"My Ibogaine trip report. Ended my opioid addiction overnight, confirmed life after death and so much more","Hi Folks, I have been addicted kratom and heroin for a year. I was using at least 70 grams of kratom a day and the last few months of that year I jumped to heroin because the kratom didn't work anymore at all. I really really wanted to end this addiction but the withdrawals were way too bad and I couldn't function on them. I looked everywhere online and went to the doctor for a solution to end these horrible opioid withdrawals. There was nothing except for this thing called ibogaine and I started to research all about it. I decided to do it and my trip was in June 2018. I went to a place called Iboga Farm in The Netherlands since I'm Dutch. Now 7 months later I haven't touched opioids again and I would like to share my trip report with all of you.

&#x200B;

Before the trip started I was really scared all day because of 2 things, the trip itself and also that ibogaine could be fatal if taken too much or if taken in combination with things that makes your heart QT time longer, like heroin and kratom. I wasn't using it anymore for a few days and was already in full withdrawal but was still afraid that maybe something could still be in my blood. I had my heart and liver checked and it was good enough to do the ibogaine but my QT value was on the edge, a little bit higher and they wouldn't have accepted me for ibogaine treatment. The people at iboga farm reassured me I would be fine and they calculated a safe but full flood dose for me.

&#x200B;

[ECG Report - Borderline prolonged QT](https://preview.redd.it/nmu5bw2k6n921.jpg?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0ff65e345ca97c74254ac61f01706d7d1b6587f)

Even tough I was scared as F$%k to do this thing, I wanted to stop this horrible opioid addiction so badly, I was willing to do EVERYTHING for it, so I did it. I was there all day and in the evening we would take the ibogaine. In the morning we did a kambo session. Kambo is a poisonous frog from the amazon. They scrape the poison from the frog. Then they burn a few spots on your skin with an incense stick so you will get blisters. After that they put the frog poison on these blisters so it will enter your lymphatic system in like 15 seconds. I felt extremely sick immediately and puked for 30 minutes straight. We had to do this on an empty stomach but what came out of us was a fluorescent yellow substance that looked very toxic. And that's the whole idea of it, the poison makes you sick but cleans your system from toxins very fast and efficient, the price of that is of course 30 minutes of extreme sickness. In my case, probably because I was the only one there in opioid withdrawal, it took 4 hours until I started to feel not sick from it anymore. I was very sick of it and puked liters of I don't no what.

&#x200B;

Somewhere around 9 in the evening we took the Ibogaine capsules. I was doing Ibogaine TA. I was there with 5 others who also did Ibogaine, most took the TA but one of them took the Iboga root bark, he was in for a bad experience, it's cheaper but much harder on your body. We first took a small test dose and waited an hour to check for any bad reactions. Everyone was fine so we started with the full dose and went to bed. Every hour the trip sitter would come and ask if we wanted more ibogaine. After 45 minutes or something I could notice my withdrawals and pain was disappearing. Also, there was no more fear, it was just gone completely. I was calm and okay with WHATEVER was there to come, it's amazing. I took about 4 doses until my heart was pumping like it never did before and cubes and stuff started floating around the room. I was in :-)

&#x200B;

Everything in the room I looked at, was moving now. It was like everything was shapeshifting into something else very slowly and subtle. There were all kinds of shapes floating through the room like cubes, spirals and stuff like that. I also saw a lot of faces on the walls, nothing scary though, just weird ancient egyptian masks or something, hard to describe. I had a lot of pleasure and joy from this and looked with amazement around the room for about an hour or so until I was no longer in the room at all.

&#x200B;

All of the sudden I was in this black void. A golden sparkling entity appeared that looked A LOT like Tinkerbell from Peter Pan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Tinkerbell](https://preview.redd.it/ybgza2e2tm921.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=806a2570014777f9c01145200bd5bec0ad2c480b)

&#x200B;

A golden glowing fairy that looked very friendly and was making me feel really great. I remember laughing so extremely hard all the time because of the things it showed me and how it explained the happenings in my life. I remember asking all sorts of questions. I asked her who he/she was and it showed me 2 of my own faces facing each other like I was talking to myself or soul or something. It didn't communicate with words, only with images. Most of it looked like icons, browser icons or logo's even. When I asked a question, such an icon would appear and I would INSTANTLY understand EVERY aspect of the answer given, it's really weird. I remember that I understood finally why certain problems appeared in my life and where they would lead me too. It made me really happy, because it showed me what I could achieve and become and there was no reason to be depressed or lose hope, I could still make all my dreams come true if I would believe in myself. I remember it showed me future outcomes but I don't remember the details of it which makes sense, you shouldn't know these kinda things, it would be cheating in life. But what I do remember is that I should have hope and keep fighting for my dreams because they are achievable and it even looked easy to be honest.

&#x200B;

After that part I was no longer in the black void. I was now in a room that looked EXACTLY like the intro from tyrant, even the motion flying through and the mandala thing in the end was almost exactly like in my trip. Here's the video:

&#x200B;

[https://youtu.be/Qa\_P8brsJvY](https://youtu.be/Qa_P8brsJvY)

&#x200B;

Tinkerbell :-) was also there and again showed me all kinds of stuff of which I was amazed. There were mandala like shapes on the walls and beautiful colors and it all meant something, it was like language and I could read it. In the end we were at this mandala, like at the end of the intro. I remember I knew that inside that mandala was ALL the knowledge available of this world, the why and what of everything. Every answer to any question you ever had in life could be answered by the knowledge in that mandala. All of the sudden this the fairy flies inside the mandala. I thought...""I'm sure I'm not allowed to go in there"" and instantly this fairy invites me in. I was so happy and couldn't wait so immediately jumped in there.

&#x200B;

It was like a portal. This part is very vague, all I can remember I was flying somewhere, could be space, could also be over earth's surface or a mixture of that. There was a HUD in front of my view that looked exactly like the HUD in a game. The HUD showed me all kinds of info while I was flying around. It was like I could process a million things at the same time and was downloading every secret of life. I wish I could remember the details of this part because this is the stuff everyone wants to know, but no one has the answers to. Now all I know is that I knew... I had all the answers and it was a wonderful and beautiful experience but it's like a dream and when you wake up, you don't remember all the details anymore but you still know you had a beautiful dream.

&#x200B;

About 8 hours in the experience I was in the dorm room again. This is the part where you have extreme introspection. I was no longer having visuals but now I had access to all kinds of memories in the past. I was able to look at them without emotion. I was just staring at the ceiling like everyone else and thinking about all these things that happened in my life and how they've shaped me. This took on for 2 full days. It's weird, it sounds boring like f#$k to stare at the ceiling for 2 days thinking about all these things without sleeping and all, but actually, when you're on ibogaine, you just don't care, you're completely fine with it. You're just comfortable the whole time. It takes forever, it does a weird thing with time and it's like you're in bed for a week but it's only 3 days. I think this is the part that scares a lot of people but it shouldn't, whatever the ibogaine shows you would possibly scare you if you were not on it but when on this stuff you're just comfortable the whole time. I was there with 5 people and everyone was lying quite and comfortable in their bed the whole experience but were afraid before the ibogaine.

&#x200B;

We started Friday evening and went out of bed on Sunday around 12 afternoon. We talked about our beautiful experiences, had some food and all went home. I didn't sleep for a week but felt energized and well the whole time. It worked like an anti-depressant for months. When I went home I could almost not believe my withdrawals were gone. I felt completely normal again and happy like I did before my 1 year full-time opioid run.

It's now 7 months later and haven't touched opioids again. I'm now quitting weed also which is gonna be hard the next few months. A 15 year habit isn't gone overnight like ibogaine did with my opioids addiction. I see many people nowadays taking ibogaine for all kinds of addictions nowadays and think they will be cured overnight but it's not that easy. Yes, it shows you your mistakes and opportunities and gives you the energy and motivation to now finally change your life... but YOU still have to do all the hard work. Replace all your unhealthy habits for healthy ones, get rid of your toxic friends, just get up and do what you have to do until you achieve what you want from live and don't fall for escapes like drugs.

&#x200B;

I think the best of ibogaine is not even that it can cure opioids withdrawals, but that it shows you how beautiful life can be. For me and many many others, the trip has been absolute proof for life after death and many people should experience that because that alone will change you in a very positive way. It shows you how valuable your life is and how beautiful it can be if you don't waste it with it the destructive habits you have. This would help not only addicts, but everyone.

Okay that's it for now, hope you have enjoyed the report. If you have more questions feel free to ask. Best wishes for 2019 to all of you!",105,10563,17,1938,1
2021-01-13 12:13:42,"It is so sad to me that people only start to appreciate life as they're confronted, really confronted with the fact, that it's ending","I'm still a young, rather healthy chap and I would expect some time still being left for me, here, on this lovely Earth of ours

But a certain, fleeting pain in my body suddenly confronted me with the fact that death is not somewhere in the distance, as a sort of destination that leaves me a given amount of time to accomplish all the goals I've been putting onto the next day, every day; No, my death is constantly arriving

I thought of all the people close to me and not so close to me. I imagined all the people who, for some reason, never wanted to acknowledge my presence, finally giving me the attention I always thought I wanted, suddenly smothering me with messages of love and approval, out of fear that their life, too, is slipping out of their hands. And on the other hand, I thought of all the people who have been watching me from afar, secretly judging me; those who worry about me only because they worry about themselves - because all they know is worry; those who would ignore me, and the best and the worst in me, even as I laid on my death bed; trying not to confront the fact that their body, too, is gradually decaying and withering away, as they're trying so desperately to put the thought of it away, until the very last moment they're forced to look it in the eyes, realising what all they've seemed to miss

I thought of all the moment I wanted my life to end and how silly it all is. I thought of how these seemingly exact thoughts are probably going to bombard me again somewhere in the near future, and how silly it all is

I am sorry. But also so, so grateful that I got to experience this weird, wild ride. And as it continues I keep this in mind. Or is it kept in my mind? Anyhow, appreciate this moment, no matter how much it stretches into chaos and beyond. There isn't anything that is to be feared",133,1834,24,349,1

&#x200B;

**How to prepare for an ego dissolution**

&#x200B;

If you take a high enough dose to reach the onset of ego dissolution, it's going to be unsettling. This is because all your concepts of reality, including your own self, dissolve to the point where you lose the ability to make sense of your surroundings and what the hell is going on.

&#x200B;

When things start to get real, you'll instinctively want to resist it. You'll be inclined to attempt to regain control of the situation, for example, by trying to think your way out of it. This is because, at the most basic levels of our minds, we're hardwired to avoid uncomfortable experiences.

&#x200B;

Understand that emotions are our bodies' way of getting us to do things that are useful for our survival. Love makes us reproduce. Ambition makes us get things done. Anger makes us defend ourselves. Fear makes us keep safe. And so on.

&#x200B;

During an ego dissolution, the ego-mind wants to preserve itself, so it triggers fear.

&#x200B;

When faced with this situation, it's near impossible to reason your way around it or convince yourself that you're fine and everything will be OK. Your ego is in fight or flight mode and the logic centers of the brain are inhibited, which prevents you from being, well, logical. So what usually happens is that you double down on trying to regain control, and by doing so and continuing to inevitably fail, the uncomfortable turns to terrifying. As your ego continues to dissolve, you can think you're dying or have gone insane.

&#x200B;

This is why it's so useful to **be ready not to resist**. 

&#x200B;

What you do to prepare is to fully acknowledge this possibility and make a pact with yourself that you'll let go and embrace whatever comes, no matter what. **NO MATTER WHAT.** Visualize yourself facing your impending doom and then surrendering to it. Imagine you're going to die or go permanently insane, and you'll accept it. See yourself letting the wave of annihilation take you where it must and not even caring. 

&#x200B;

The problem is nobody likes to think about their upcoming trip in these terms, because it's uncomfortable to begin with. You prefer to pretend your trip will be fun and illuminating, and none of this ugly stuff will happen. That's when people get blindsided. Or, they simply set themselves up so well to avoid any unpleasantness, that when it comes, they seek distraction and never reach the deepest depths.

2019-01-20 16:23:42,‚ÄúThe psychotic drowns in the same waters in which the mystic swims with delight.‚Äù - Joseph Campbell,"I think a lot of people here can relate to the quote in the title. In this post I will share my own experiences with psychosis, schizophrenia, antipsychotics, recreational drugs, psychedelic experiences and spirituality and I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject.

I was very depressed more or less from when I was 15-22. I was high functioning until I became 22 where everything in my life just crashed. I started drinking everyday and later I started smoking weed more or less every day. I had never had a love for music, but my friend who introduced me to weed would always talk about music and music theory when we smoked and I slowly started loving music. 

I took MDMA with my girlfriend which more or less cured my depression but it made me become almost bipolar in a way since I would constantly switch between being depressed and manic from day to day. I then tried LSD and holy fuck an experience that was. I played a guitar during a trip and even though I didn't know any chords or anything I fell in love with the guitar and have since played a lot of guitar. LSD gave me a love for music and simply a love for life. It showed me that there is probably more between heaven and earth and that there are some things science might never be able to answer and that's okay. 

Well I have also experienced negative effects from LSD. I had a psychotic episode from LSD because I took a way to high dose with my friend and walked on the beach at night. We weren't sure if we had walked into the water and drowned ourselves or not. When the trip ended my friend was fine but I still wasn't convinced that I wasn't currently drowning and that this was just all in my mind. I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and I was put on antipsychotics.

The antipsychotics I tried (I have tried 4 different) all made me extremely depressed and void of emotions. It was basically like depression on steroids. It might me ""stable"" but I couldn't live life like that so I would eventually quit my meds. I then got admitted to the psychiatric hospital more times because I again took way to high doses of different psychedelics without having really ""recovered"" from my psychedelic induced psychosis.

I now have the diagnosis ""paranoid schizophrenic"" and I am currently on a mixture of antidepressants and antipsychotics. When I was doing psychedelics regularly I would often spend much time thinking about the universe and all that spiritual mess. This felt really good and I think I have never enjoyed life more than that period where I just took low doses 100-300mcg of acid 1-2 times a month.

Well now that I am on medication and seeing a psychiatrist once a week, everything spiritual or psychedelic related is deemed ""psychotic"". They recently upped my meds because I'm basically tripping 24/7 off just my own brain chemicals. I am actively trying to distance myself from everything psychedelic related, but I think that is part of why I am suffering and I just realized that today. 

I have been really depressed for the last month or so, but I woke up today with the attitude that I would ""swim in the waters with delight, instead of drowning"". And today has actually been my first non-depressed day in a month. I actively embrace the weird things about my life like the entities in my head that is talking to me / showing me vivid images and I look at all my hallucinations (everything waving / breathing like being on 150mcg LSD, seeing people / shadows moving out the corner of my eyes and generally seeing things morphing in my peripheral). 

Just this simple change of me allowing it to happen rather than fight it have turned the voices in my head into funny ones instead of suicidal ones. The vivid images I see in my head are beautiful almost psychedelic, instead of vivid gory images of me killing myself. I have had so much more energy today than I have had in a long time. I know that the way I perceive and experience reality might be different from ""normal people"" but so what? If I can live a happy life being different, why should I try so hard to be ""normal"" if it makes me depressed? 

I would like to hear from you guys, what your thoughts on all of this is. Has psychedelics helped you / caused you harm? Has antipsychotics helped you / caused you harm? Do you experience life differently from ""normal"" people and are you okay with that? I would love to hear your stories.",99,4405,17,800,1

2018-12-06 13:33:44,"PSA: Importance of embracing your own separateness and psychological self. How years of looking for unity, oneness and egoless thoughtless states fucked me up","Took me years of ayahuascas, psychodelics, spirituality, trying to get rid of my ""ego"", to live in the present, to have no thoughts etc. to finally arrive at this conclusion: sense of self is real and healthy. It should be nurtured and taken care of. Of course from ultimate reality perspective everything is one, and there is noone. But in daily personal life, our life story, thoughts, view of ourselves is more important than feeling connected to absolute reality all the time. I've seen enough of oneness, I see everything is love. But to function in a world healthy ego is crucial for me. I have to express this unity through my individuality. I was avoiding the feeling of separation by looking for oneness and it was reinforcing separation. Now I love to feel being separate. To have a beginning and end. I start at the top of my head and end at my feet. At the same time I can see that all is one and that there is level that transcends this psychological me. 

But please, please do not treat your sense of self, your thoughts, emotions as pathology. They are what makes you human. There can be sicknesses in the ways we deal with our emotions and thoughts, so we use thoughts and actions to escape reality. We are humans, with thoughts, emotions, bodies, relationships, financial problems etc. If we were to exists as pure consciousness, why would we be given thoughts, personalities and stories? We are unity operating and expressing as separate entities. Embrace separation and oneness at the same time. Focusing only on oneness is an escape from reality. You can focus so much on chasing this magical place where everything is one and perfect, that you ignore the human part. Human part will always be somewhat messy. But it is our job to heal what there needs to be healed. To take care of human part. 

I've seen too many ""spiritual"" people that completely neglect their humanity. In fact in this world there are too many things that help people run away from some parts of themselves: whether it is cocaine, tv, internet, meditation, psychedelics, searching for egoless states - it's all fucking escape. And not an escape by default, but what I'm saying is it can be used as an escape. You can't imagine how many parts of myself I have buried alive with many different escapes. Escaping is not bad by itself, everyone needs it from time to time. But if majority of your life is about escaping then it is sickness of the soul. You find your own voice through individuality, embracing your story, and becoming one with what you are running away from. You cannot bypass your pain by saying ""pain is there but there is noone that feels the pain"" or some other spiritual bullshit. Own your pain and feel it. Your own pain is what makes you who you are. 

We take psychodelics or meditate, see that ""all is one, there is no problem"", and we think this is the cure for everything. It is not. Everything is one but I still need to go to shop, buy food and eat it, otherwise I will die. Taking care of your ""separate"" psychological/emotional self is the same. It is not done just by seeing everything is one. It is done by taking action, like going to the store and buying things and then putting them through your mouth. And the tragedy is that if you do not eat you will die quickly, but you can escape from your humanity all your life and die of old age without ever seeing who you are as an individual. 

And here is the catch: the more real you are with yourself with who you are as a human, with your pain and personal story, the more oneness is revealed to you in daily life.

2021-02-15 07:25:58,Ive become hyper-aware of other people‚Äôs suffering and it‚Äôs changing the way I live my life.,"I don‚Äôt really know how to say this without sounding stupid, because it‚Äôs a stupid thing to say. But I ate a lot of mushrooms over the summer, like abused them a bit, ate them everyday for a week and like 2-5 times a month before and after that. And man what the fuck.

I‚Äôve always heard people talk about it, but it‚Äôs insane how much psychedelics have expanded my consciousness. 

And the thing that gets me above all else, above finding God again and no longer being suicidal. is that I‚Äôve realized that **everyone around me is suffering and is still bearing trauma from their past.** Myself included. 

I‚Äôve only realized this because I‚Äôve become very aware of how my life events have shaped my being, and that certain very traumatic events in my childhood left a very very deep scar in my psyche and directly impacts who I am. 

Psychedelics have made me realize that all this suffering I‚Äôve felt during my life, isn‚Äôt just my suffering, but everybody‚Äôs suffering. So many people had terrible things happen to them as children that diverted their life course drastically. That people‚Äôs potentials are limited by all the times life and other people have told them no. 

People have dreams and give up on them. Everybody is a wide eyed child with the world at their fingertips, endless possibilities in front of them. And one by one those opportunities diminish, and people find themselves cornered in to a life they didn‚Äôt choose but settled for. And people wear a smile on their face and try to get by, but everyone has so much pain in their eyes. 

People suffer from suicidal thoughts and depression for years, and the worst part is, the more depressed you are, the more your social group almost exiles you. Like animals avoiding a diseased one of their own kind. I‚Äôve experienced it myself and I‚Äôve felt myself react in kind to others. 

This mostly has to do with things I‚Äôve noticed in my family and friends. I‚Äôm not argumentative anymore. I don‚Äôt want to sway anybody. I just want to make people feel heard and loved. 

It‚Äôs hard though. It‚Äôs hard to set boundaries.

I find myself feeling very confused in a way. That I don‚Äôt understand how reality works. That nobody does. That the mental landscape we inherit from ages past is not infallible, and that I don‚Äôt think there is a right way to look things. That all perspectives are valid and are the million sides of the million sided coin that is reality. 

And in that confusion, I find wonder and awe at simple things. That everything is very amazing and very alive, that the whole universe is alive with the spirit of God (or whatever you wanna call it). 

And well, I don‚Äôt know if I broke my brain or if I fixed it. 

All I want to do anymore is become a union electrician for a few years. That‚Äôs what my whole being is telling me to do. Work with my hands, pray and meditate, go sober, and stack as much money as possible so that I can figure out a way to help alleviate people‚Äôs suffering. And in my time off, I want to explore as much as God‚Äôs green Earth as I can be blessed to see.

It says it in the name ... DEATH. Yes, you will DIE. Your memories, your desires, your goals, you as a human will no longer be. You may think it will be fun, however the experience is nothing but humbling.

You also have to deal with the aftermath, you have to come back and LIVE again as a human being. Now this is some serious shit right here, because some people may not be able to deal with that. It may take a looong time to ground yourself again and for some ... it may never happen.

2021-05-21 13:12:48,Since I began meditating and living consciously things have started falling into place by themselves.,"I think a big part of it has to do with being detached from outcomes and also letting go of trying to control life. When you're attached to outcomes and are trying to control life you're in a state of tension, you're not in the present moment and what I've noticed is when people don't live in tune with the present moment life tends to bring all kinds of challenges to them to help them wake up. When you expect things from life and from people, you generally don't get what you want, and even when you do those things never make you happy for long. Actually they never make you happy at all, they just seem to, that's why that happiness never lasts. I used to live like this and I was miserable.

Since I stopped trying to control life and imposing my will on it it's almost as if life has been taking care of itself without me doing much. This doesn't mean that I always get what I want, in fact, I've come to realise that desire is one of the main reasons why people try to control life and also why they suffer, because life cannot be controlled. Since I started meditating I've started letting go of my desires and now those things that I so desperately wanted in the past are now coming to me but now I'm not dependent on them for my happiness, even though I still appreciate them.

The most recent example of this is a girl who came across one of my songs on reddit. She reached out to me wanting to collab and we made a song together called ['Growing Up'](https://open.spotify.com/track/3fDktYl2Uvow73IUyB6BRJ?si=2720412e6e1a4691) and she even made [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybre2k08040) for it which is pretty cool. I will say though that while I notice that things are starting to work out by themselves, I also notice that the ego wants to jump in and take credit for it, and if one is not careful they are likely to become identified with the ego again, which leads to suffering. So while things have been falling into place by themselves, I also remain aware that I don't get identified with the ego so that I don't take credit for what is happening. Instead, I just watch it happen without holding on to it.",101,2141,15,388,1

I don‚Äôt want to be a king. I want to be rich only because society has placed a monetary value on the exchange of goods and services.

The people are incentivized by the money, but if I could make my local convenience store owner a beat in exchange for the products, I would never try to make a dollar. If I could give my favourite restaurant owners an essay in exchange for an order I would never make another dollar. But the people are incentivized by money, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing, until the people are willing to justify certain means for certain ends.

I am a sophisticated human being, I don‚Äôt want any control over anyone else, I don‚Äôt want power over anyone else, I want control and power over myself, and that‚Äôs hard by itself. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard for me to clean my room, let alone wanting to exert force over another individual. I‚Äôm too cool for those intentions. I want to do things that bring me joy, I want to be in spaces I‚Äôm comfortable in, I want to be around people I love, I want to eat food that tastes good, I wouldn‚Äôt mind growing it, and cooking it, I want to look at beautiful things, I want to be creative and imaginative, I want to spread joy, love and positivity, i want to create the best thing I could ever make, I want to take pictures of sunsets and hang out with cool people, I want to see the newest artists, the newest creatives and musicians, the coolest designers, I want to learn things I never knew, i want to do things I‚Äôve never done before, I want to have as much fun as I possibly can in one lifetime, I want to be around and learn from scientists, engineers, architects, and philosophers, i want to be around the beautiful people with pure intentions hell bent on making the world a more enjoyable place.

I don‚Äôt know a single person that wants to be in a conflict, everyone tells you they just want to chill, but I feel like humanity as a culture, in a very general, yet specific sense, is just unaware of how to achieve that. I mean that very fundamentally, many people are scared of death cause they haven‚Äôt figured out how to live, so they make stuff up to complain about and create problems where there are none. That‚Äôs why they try to control people, cause they don‚Äôt know how to enjoy life, and some of that inability to enjoy life comes from this systems perspective of what‚Äôs a worthy incentive to chase. People are willing to give away their lives, their children, their values, their belief systems, their cultures, their ways of life, their time, all for Pyrrhic victories. They embark on meaningless quests for meaningless rewards that ultimately harm everyone. The mark of an evolved individual is being able to attract to themselves without impeding on someone else‚Äôs human rights, ways of life, or existence. We live on the planet where food grows out of the ground. Almost everything else is a man made problem. We are sophisticated enough to operate devices that people would have called sorcery a hundred years ago, but some of our attributes are still so primitive, embarrassingly primitive.

Mass shootings make me ashamed to be a human being. Slavery makes me ashamed to be a human being. Sexual assault makes me ashamed to be a human being. War makes me ashamed to be a human man being. I see deer in the park and can‚Äôt help but think of how ignorant we can be in comparison. They gallop around grass, eating as they go, sticking together, avoiding roads and cars surprisingly accurately, and living their best lives. Then I turn on the tv and I see people that are really supposed to lead me screaming at each other, wearing blackface, going to war, enslaving people, destroying the planet, arresting scientists, killing well meaning people, it‚Äôs ugly. But I know I‚Äôm not doing that, I know I have the intention to be a good human being that adds value to other peoples lives and I really don‚Äôt want to control or harm anyone for any ends whatsoever.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an end as valuable as a person, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an end as valuable as my time, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an end as valuable as my creativity, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an end as valuable as kindness, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an end as valuable as Beauty, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an end as valuable as skills. But I also come from a nomadic people. I‚Äôm only 1 generation removed from people who lived solely off of livestock. If you are in control of your own mind, you can survive any environment and any condition. That‚Äôs why Mandela could spend 27 years in jail and come out sane. His mind was his sanctuary. He was in his right mind while his oppressors who were supposed to be of a superior intellect were actually suffering from mass delusion, a form of psychosis they tried to indoctrinate him into. Mandela actually saw reality for what it was, apartheid was an institution of psychopathic and deranged people, blinded by psychopathic and deranged ends, that persist to this day. The problem is, in a society of lies the truth really does seem crazy.

James Baldwin said these people were so crazy that they had really convinced themselves that the world they created, and the categories they created, the things they did to create their alleged privileged position, these beliefs they made us believe are actually superior modes of being, to be a fox is to be superior, to be a conqueror is to be superior, to be a wolf in sheeps clothing is seen as an intelligent form of being, trickery, chicanery and manipulation are lauded as tactical, having control over people and land is seen as intelligent, as opposed to completely ludicrous. These people are ridiculous, the world they made is nonsense, their incentives are laughable, their system is a joke, and the great thing is, once you realize that You realize what the real valuable things are in life, I‚Äôve actually been given a glimpse at the things that make life worthwhile, I‚Äôm grateful everyday to have felt them, I‚Äôm grateful everyday to be outside at a certain time when the sun is going down, and being able to see that, and appreciate it, I‚Äôm grateful everyday for my ability to love, I‚Äôm grateful everyday for my ability to ponder, I‚Äôm grateful everyday for my ability to create, and to enjoy music, and to know the value of good conversation, and know the value in the exchange of information, and the value and utility of information when applied in my day to day life.

I know the value of a good color palette, I know the value of juxtaposition, I know the value of symmetry, i know the value of art, I know the value of science, I know the value of human beings and what we are capable of when we apply our minds to the things that are worthwhile in this life. I really don‚Äôt think most politicians know all of that, I personally can‚Äôt imagine ever taking those role, I don‚Äôt see the actual value most of them have in society. I understand they‚Äôre put in place to allocate and delegate, and Im related to many people involved in politics in some way shape or form, and I completely understand that sometimes people do get into positions with the idea that they are going to be benefiting society, and that‚Äôs all good and well. But I feel like the culture of those positions inherently just lead to a middleman position. It‚Äôs people put in between people providing the value, trying to control the exchange of value.

I‚Äôm being reductive to a certain extent, but when you look at the state of the world you can‚Äôt really tell me they‚Äôre doing a good job, I‚Äôm talking about as a collective. We do more for each other and ourselves than any monarch, President, mayor, or congressman can ever do for us. Many corporations do more for us than politicians have ever done for us. I respect Jeff Bezos way more than Joe Biden. This isn‚Äôt a rant about any politician in particular but I only make that comparison because of recent events that disgusted me, personally speaking. Say what you want about Jeff Bezos, I receive everything from Amazon on time, way faster than how long online shipping used to take less than a decade ago, I get great customer service, I know a bunch of people that have been employed by them, what ever you would like to say about his workplace practices, his service is providing value to peoples lives. Joe Biden went on Twitter and ranted in the same way I‚Äôm kind of doing now.

I‚Äôm a 23 year old sitting on a couch talking shit, and the President was pleading to me how I‚Äôm supposed to be pleading to him. The same President that told Black people they weren‚Äôt black if they didn‚Äôt vote for him, went on Twitter and asked me how to end white supremacy. If I don‚Äôt see value, I don‚Äôt see value. America is trillions of dollars in debt and many of this systems ideologies are harming everyone. Buts this isn‚Äôt just America they‚Äôre just the main superpower so they‚Äôre the prime example, but this is a global issue, this is a flawed system, the way this man made world is, in its current form is incorrect.

Nature is not incorrect, nature makes perfect sense. You guys aren‚Äôt living right. I‚Äôm speaking from an outsiders perspective because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always seen myself. I never wanted to hurt other kids when I was kid, I was never a bully, I‚Äôve never had the inclination, I‚Äôve never seen it as useful. That‚Äôs not how I attracted what I wanted to myself. I didn‚Äôt have to conquer to get what I wanted. Girls never liked me cause I was tough. People were always around me cause of my personality. I never got paid to beat someone up. I have been paid to use my words, I‚Äôve been paid to use my time, I‚Äôve been paid to use my creativity, I‚Äôve been paid to use my ingenuity, intelligence, inspiration and motivation, I‚Äôve been paid for my value, not to sound like I‚Äôm bragging but I feel like that‚Äôs what actually valuable people ever attain value for, their value. There‚Äôs no amount of money that can make someone cool, there‚Äôs no amount of money or skin color that can make someone valuable.

In the words of Tony Stark, if you‚Äôre nothing without the suit, you shouldn‚Äôt have it. If all you have is your money or your race, it‚Äôs still not going to make you interesting, it‚Äôs not going to make you talented, it might make you superficially good looking but it‚Äôs not gonna make you fun. There are millionaires that kill themselves, and supposedly superior people killing themselves and each other. It‚Äôs so barbaric and clear that any being that claims superiority yet acts like a baboon has no concept of what superiority would even look like. Our society‚Äôs main problem was how skewed their value systems were. That‚Äôs why their society is crumbling in front of our eyes.

I feel bad for my generation cause we really didn‚Äôt do any of that, we were just born as it‚Äôs reaping what it sewed. People around my age aren‚Äôt responsible for this system for the most part, even these kids shooting up schools and killing each other, they‚Äôre evil don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they‚Äôre not evil alone, they‚Äôre evil because of ideologies that go so far back that they can‚Äôt even fathom it. The brainwashing is so deeply rooted in this structure, it‚Äôs rotted their minds. They can‚Äôt see past their own savagery. The new society needs to understand that the value is ultimately people. I‚Äôd rather be stranded on an island with the best chef than the richest man, the wittiest politician or someone of a supposed superior race. Kindness is a form of intelligence and brilliance, there‚Äôs nothing noble about exerting force and power to impede on the rights of others.

Don‚Äôt be a nonsense person, don‚Äôt fall into how ridiculous this society is, their ideas are backwards but they‚Äôll try to convince you they‚Äôre progressive. They‚Äôll do damage and act as though it‚Äôs virtuous, they think ignorance is wisdom, they just can‚Äôt see the full picture. A lot of these people really don‚Äôt understand things like love, taste, laughter, and joy. I don‚Äôt know if the society I‚Äôm hoping for comes in my lifetime, but I know how I‚Äôve chosen to live, and that‚Äôs ultimately all I care about, and all I personally think anyone should care about. Instead of trying to control other people, or trying to leave a legacy, more than trying to achieve fame or infamy, we should think of building communities with likeminded people of various necessary skills, trades and resources, with an emphasis on creating and experiencing beauty. I‚Äôm using the term beauty as a metaphor for all the things that are self evidently the right things to be doing. Good parents are beautiful, a job well done is beautiful, cleanliness is beautiful, creativity and knowledge are beautiful, culture is beautiful, excellent electrical work, plumbing, architecture, landscaping, artists, musicians, chefs, friends, family members, an honorable agreement, a fair trade and exchange, all of these are self evidently beautiful. Harmony is self evidently beautiful.

Joy is self evidently beautiful, laughter, happiness, grace, aesthetic appreciation, these things are self evident. At least they should be. Things that are ugly are also self evidently ugly, and our job should be the elimination of the ugly. And I don‚Äôt mean go and kill that person you don‚Äôt find sexy, I mean eliminating these deranged psychotic ways of being from our day to day. Stop treating wars like a conversation piece and start treating it as what it is, human beings becoming lunatics. These politicians lose their minds, same as these kids shooting schools. The politicians are setting the example. I‚Äôve seen the behavior in children throwing tantrums and none of us allow that. We all understand that the children are going insane for a second, but nobody ever steps back from insane situations and calls them insane.

Why isn't George Bush being prosecuted for war crimes after admitting that the War in Iraq was unjustified? It just became a meme like millions of people didn't die in some of the most cruel and inhumane manners in human history. It‚Äôs literally a viral moment, they‚Äôre calling it the ‚ÄúFreudian slip of the millennium‚Äù this thing is a joke to them. These people are deranged. They are morally bankrupt. No group is free from these people. No race is free from these people, even if it does seem like certain groups perpetuate certain actions more than others, not pointing any fingers but I think we all know who I‚Äôm talking about. But I‚Äôve seen enough people from every group to redeem my faith in individuals. Even though I do think certain cultures approaches do come from certain environmental factors that forced them into certain ways of life, that continue to perpetuate themselves to this day. If you come from a place of scarcity, and you could only bring what you needed to yourself through taking it from someone else, or harming someone else in order to attain it, that will be the way you interact with the world, even culturally, things that are unnecessary become habitual tradition. So they built this society on those ideologies, killing natives, colonizing lands and enslaving people. Then we‚Äôre shocked when they‚Äôre consistent every generation. That‚Äôs usually how culture works.

Culture is pretty consistent because it‚Äôs taught in the home. To understand how insane the society I live in today is, and the level of cognitive dissonance that exists, you must first understand this thing they do called ‚ÄúLand acknowledgement.‚Äù Where they shoutout all the Natives they killed. Land acknowledgment is crazy because it‚Äôs like if I break in your home, move everyone in my family in, kill everyone in your family, and I constantly remind you that it‚Äôs your house, I killed your whole family, and I will continue living here for the foreseeable future. I‚Äôve never heard of anything meaner, and the funniest part is, it‚Äôs the ones who think they‚Äôre the good ones doing it. I really believe they think they‚Äôre helping when they do land acknowledgments, but deep down they know that‚Äôs not helping the people on reservations without clean water. This system is silly, the problem is it‚Äôs dangerous. It‚Äôs laughably corrupt beyond belief. In plain sight. That‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs falling, embarrassingly. This will go down as one of the funniest societal collapses of all time.

I love the modern western world more than any other period in time, culturally and conceptually. A lot of the ideas and art of this civilization have influenced us and evolved us, in spite of its actual objectives. The system those people conjured up was created to destroy me, I shouldn‚Äôt be able to write this, I shouldn‚Äôt be able to have my own thoughts, I shouldn‚Äôt be able to see how silly it all really is, but it simultaneously gave me that ability. I don‚Äôt want a complete collapse of this system, but it‚Äôs obviously built on an unsustainable foundation, and whether it purges itself, or nature purges it, the conditions created by it can‚Äôt last.

This way of being is not sustainable, war isn‚Äôt sustainable, greed isn‚Äôt sustainable, fear isn‚Äôt sustainable, corruption isn‚Äôt sustainable, oppression isn‚Äôt sustainable, injustice isn‚Äôt sustainable, pollution isn‚Äôt sustainable. You‚Äôll get away with it but it‚Äôs really only for so long and if you don‚Äôt see how what Thomas Jefferson was talking about is coming to pass, I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre blind. I don‚Äôt hate any group of people, I see people as people, I do hate the system created by a small group of elites in order to oppress people in the globe and make poor colonized people around the world feel content with their awful circumstances because at least they‚Äôre better than another group. This is a global phenomenon. It‚Äôs a silly system perpetuated by silly people who bring no real value outside of the colour of their skin, their ethnicity or their gender, they have no talents, they have no skills, they‚Äôre not interesting, they don‚Äôt know how to communicate effectively, but at least they get to be part of a group.

Certain people have no real identity and that‚Äôs what these ideologies and institutions prey on. From gangs, to military recruiters, the police, political parties and religious institutions all prey on this need for individuals to belong to a group, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that if the group is founded on something real or productive. My skin color and gender is the least cool thing about me, those are just biological facts about me, and to think you know anything about me based on those facts is like thinking you know something about someone because they have acne. It‚Äôs a silly justification for a silly system, but it leads these insecure insane people to do horrific things to other human beings.

These are the nonsense people and we live in the nonsense times where the nonsense is heightened and they want us to act like it‚Äôs a political issue. Like someone‚Äôs dead kids is a parking ticket to be handled in a court with a juror and evenly sided arguments coming from both sides. Like anyone wants to hear the other side of this? Like we need a devils advocate in a satanic system? Like anyone cares about the other side of this? As if it matters what the deranged lunatic has to say. And that‚Äôs what the whole system is founded upon. Murderers and power hungry maniacs with insane means to justify their insane ends, who have attained enough influence over the world to convince people of the superiority in their way of life, and who‚Äôs ideologies have trickled down from generation, to generation, we constantly relive the same situation. Murder is as frequent on this planet as greetings at this point, but we still have the ability to choose between the two. We can choose to live together in peace and harmony, regardless of the global power outages and weather conditions, if human beings are united and focused on a common goal, we can really do anything.

When society works it‚Äôs a wonderful thing, when systems work it‚Äôs a beautiful thing, organization is a beautiful thing, everything in nature is organized for a common task. Ants, plants, bees and trees are all able to synchronize, communicate and be productive towards a common purpose without resorting to the levels of barbarism that we‚Äôve unfortunately succumb to as a race of beings up to this point. The thing is, regardless of how much we continue to study history and find parallels with the past, we can never really go back in time. We‚Äôre always living in the moment. It‚Äôs always right now, and we have the ability to make decisions with every second, every minute and every day that passes, we are able to decide who we want to be and what we want to become.

I don‚Äôt want my kids to grow up doing shooting drills like me. I don‚Äôt want my kids to grow up in a world where people are at war. I don‚Äôt want my kids to grow up in a world with this level of greed and scarcity mentality. I don‚Äôt want my kids to feel as invaluable as this society tries to make human beings feel. I would want my kids to know that their value is in them, it‚Äôs in what they do, it‚Äôs in their character, it‚Äôs in the knowledge they have and it‚Äôs in what they‚Äôre able to do with that knowledge that brings something of value to themselves or the world, and that value doesn‚Äôt need to be what society deems as the valuable thing to attain. I would want my kids to know that the truth is an inner compass and regardless of the noise outside, you have to stay connected to who you are and be aware of who you are not. I would want my kids to value their time and how they choose to spend it, I would want my kids to know of concepts like leisure, rest, comfort, relationships and joy.

I would want my kids to act as though they mattered, like what they do actually has an impact on the world around them, and that they have the ability to dictate their perception, I would want them to know that just because something is a prevailing practice, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs useful. I would want them to know that freedom is their birthright and their responsibility, that there is an incorrect way of being in the world and that you can‚Äôt get away with doing the wrong thing, even if you feel like you did, because your ramifications will haunt you, if not in your life then in your childrens. And even then, a life of doing the wrong thing never seems like it‚Äôs actually being enjoyed. It seems like these people are miserable, they tell you they‚Äôre miserable in how they act. We are the people, we are everything, we are everything we love and we are everything we hate, no one man can rise above the conditions of the whole, the oppressor eventually becomes oppressed himself, like how prison guards ultimately become prisoners themselves. We‚Äôre all in this together whether we like it or not and we either learn to live together and in harmony with the way of being or perish.

2022-09-23 14:53:40,"Ketamine is crazy man. I lived another life for years during a k-hole. This is one of the first times I've truly TRULY felt that I was the universal consciousness (as we all are), and it's stuck with me ever since.","So uh, I just realized something. When I k-holed the other day (this was my first K-Hole and first time IM'ing ketamine), I think I lived a different life. I have memories that shouldn't be there. Very very vivid memories. I remember making bread for a family that wasn't mine and a dog that wasn't mine. This went on for what felt like years. Literal years. I remember being scared of the dad because he was abusive. 

I couldn't remember his name though. All I knew is that he was basically evil and I then went into a thought loop (I was no longer with this family, I was now in the void) of being totally alone as a consciousness in the world, that I was doomed to repeat living for all of eternity.

I remember feeling just totally bummed out and aghast that I had never truly realized this before. Suddenly, I started to come down. I started thinking about my own life and being thankful for the experiences I've had. I didn't care if it were really true that I can never truly die. Even if I am ""doomed to repeat life"" then so be it. Sure, right now life isn't so great. 

I'm in debt, blah blah blah. It's ok. I've had some amazing experiences and experienced love beyond anything I have ever deserved. Life is a good thing. Bad things happen during life, but good things happen too.

Not sure where I'm going with this, but I just suddenly remembered a bunch of stuff and wanted to write it down.

Hope someone finds this somewhat interesting, and I love you all. Truly.

tl;Dr: K-holed for the first time. Lived another life. I have vivid memories of this life. Then, I realized I was the universal consciousness. Truly alone, while never ever really being alone. Then I realized that's not a bad thing. Life is good.",214,1727,41,319,1

You‚Äôre a human.  You were born into this world, took in information and experienced various things, and will die.  Every single one of you.  So take a step back and ask, *why am I letting this human tell me how to live my life?  How are they right, subjectively, and how can I trust their discretion when they‚Äôve only experienced as much as I have?*. 

If my point came across correctly, I‚Äôm saying that no one knows anything.  Human minds strive to make meaning of the circumstances around them.  You HAVE to make money to live and be happy.  You HAVE to procreate.  You HAVE to go to school and get a higher education.  

No.  You don‚Äôt.

That‚Äôs not why we‚Äôre here.  That‚Äôs why we THINK we‚Äôre here, but that‚Äôs incorrect.

Anyhow. Here's a 9 or 10 months later update:

* I don't drink anymore. I was sort of a functional alcoholic before but I've lost all appetite for alcohol. I can politely sip a beer and then at first chance pour it in the sink.
* I just completed a 5k in 25 minutes, when 9 months ago, I couldn't get up the stairs without panting like a pig.
* I also lost about 45 lbs (20 kg), gained some muscle (and look a lot better) and I am no longer overweight according to my BMI. Instead, I eat healthy and work out regularly.
* I have also advanced my career in a very meaningful way, and overall I am getting to know myself and I know what I want in life.
* ... and once in a while, I think about the Ouroboros that so vividly and clearly visited me in my living room.

2021-04-10 14:43:30,"2 years ago I left a well paying job, traveled a lot, and took control of my life","Potentially ruining my career that I had worked very hard for. I did a lot of interesting and unique things and am very fortunate to be able to do them but I also worked very hard to put myself in this situation even though I didn‚Äôt realize it was something I would do until shortly before I did it. 

I will never look back. I will never have a job that takes control of my life again unless it‚Äôs something I absolutely love. I will probably never use my degree again even though I spent a ton of money and tons of studying getting it.

I have a new outlook on life. I have no interest in worrying about retirement anymore. I have no interest in ever buying a house or a nice car, both of which I could have easily done in my last job. I have no interest in climbing the corporate ladder anymore.

I love to entertain. I‚Äôve been on stage many times either for music, standup comedy, or improv comedy and most of which were for free. Of course, in standup, most have to do a ton of open mics to get better, which pay nothing and sometimes even cost money to be on, on top of all the traveling to do them.

The stage is my favorite place in the world and I have been working hard at being on in the last 2 years, performing hundreds of times during this period.  And the best part is, money is not my goal. As I get better and learn to work the system, I am curious to see how money not being the goal will play out. Of course I have to eat, so at times I will have to make something but I don‚Äôt need the home or the nice car and couldn‚Äôt care less about them. If others want those things, that‚Äôs fine with me, it‚Äôs their life, not mine.

It‚Äôs so much fun being on stage when you‚Äôre having a good set, on top of the crowd being into it and you‚Äôre helping them enjoy life for a moment. And it sucks when nothing is working. What a lesson in humility that can be. 

I have no debt anymore, I have very few bills, and I have amazing friends and family. I am fortunate this way but I also busted my ass to pay off all my debt and to get rid of bills. I have also rid myself of most of my possessions. 

Maybe there is a such thing as a life purpose, maybe there isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm going to enjoy doing what I do and make the most of everything while I have this time here.

Enjoy",81,2280,18,458,1
2022-01-20 11:28:47,I'm an Atheist who found spirituality through mushrooms and meditation. Told my sister that taking mushrooms was more spiritual for me than going to church. She got angry. But here is my question...,"Respectfully. My question is, why do people view biblical spiritual experiences as something to be believed (talking animals, resurrections, etc.) But think that ACTUAL spiritual experiences are bad??? In other words, if I believe in the spiritual experiences of those in the Bible, then that's considered GOOD by my peers. But if I have MY OWN spiritual experiences, then that's considered BAD. Why tho? Why is it MORE ACCEPTABLE to believe religious stories over your own spiritual experiences??? Why should I trust other people's experiences but NOT my own?",198,560,33,89,1
2021-08-03 09:00:26,Terrance McKenna was so correct so often and the fact his name not known by all makes me sad.,"Terrence McKenna was a diamond amongst coal, his whole life was dedicated to waking people up to the truth. I just felt the need to say it because these quotes are so pertinent to today's world.


""We have to create culture, don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and time where you are now is the most immediate sector of your universe, and if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, then you are disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons, icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that you want to dress like X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of thinking. That is all cultural diversion, and what is real is you and your friends and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told 'no', we're unimportant, we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that.' And then you're a player, you don't want to even play in that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world.""

Also this one explains the death of ego so well

""Chaos is what we've lost touch with. This is why it is given a bad name. It is feared by the dominant archetype of our world, which is Ego, which clenches because its existence is defined in terms of control.""

Then this, again just speaking honest truths

""You are an explorer, and you represent our species, and the greatest good you can do is to bring back a new idea, because our world is endangered by the absence of good ideas. Our world is in crisis because of the absence of consciousness.""

Just thought I should remind people. Your mind is not limited to what you perceive as true. If you manage to manifest your voice and your will, you can shake the planet.

2020-05-16 16:34:05,My experience with 15G of mushrooms,"I'm always interested in other people‚Äôs psychedelic experiences. So I thought maybe others were curious about mine. Since I‚Äôm trying to recall everything I can and be as detailed as possible. This may end up being long af.

So‚Ä¶ sorry in advance or you‚Äôre welcome?

A little background, I first tried mushrooms back in the summer of 2018 and up until that point I hadn't experimented with any drugs other than alcohol and weed. I was curious to try shrooms because as I read up on it I noticed many people describing their trips as one of the most important experiences of their lives. This really intrigued me as I equated that to finding your true purpose.

I was a little nervous for my first experience as I didn't know what to expect. So to ease into it, a good friend of mine and I did about 2.5 grams. It wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting as I didn‚Äôt hallucinate or notice anything out of the ordinary but I still ended up having a great time. It felt taking a strong edible or smoking a lot of weed and getting the giggles like you would the first time you smoked but minus the munchies (A huge plus for me).

A few months later I gave them another try. I was determined to have one of those profound experiences. I was specifically interested in directly challenging one's ego. So I tried about 5 grams all at once as I read this would get me to that next level.

But again I didn‚Äôt notice any significant difference. This time I did see some vibrant colors and felt incredibly joyful for all of it so was another great experience but just not what I was looking for quite yet. The same friend who did them with me previously did the 5 grams as well. He got super high and at times very uncomfortable.

At one point he paced around in my kitchen for an hour while we chatted. He said it was the only thing that kept him calm. I‚Äôm sure he walked over 2 miles. So I‚Äôm certain the shrooms were legit. I figured I‚Äôd try more next time.

After another few months I decided to really up the dose. To 15G. Would 7, 9 or even 10 suffice? Probably, but I wanted to make sure I got ‚Äúthere‚Äù this time. Was it stupid? 100%.

But I had no idea what I would be in for so I went for it.

Thus I made some shroom tea, drank it and sat on my couch. Contrary to popular advice, I was by myself. I figured that if I got really drunk or really high I‚Äôd prefer to be left alone rather then having to inconvenience someone to take care of me. So if I have a bad trip I‚Äôd rather be left alone as well. Stupid I know.

As I was sitting on my couch within 20 minutes I could see some intense visuals starting to show up. I was blown away since this was my first time experiencing something like that. Something that is so unbelievable yet so lucid at the same time. It was the closest I have ever felt to being a little kid since actually being a kid. I was so happy and I was laughing uncontrollably. It didn‚Äôt make any sense, but I didn‚Äôt care, it didn‚Äôt have to.

Then I remembered I had gotten back from the gym before I drank the tea so I summoned enough sober brain power to jump in the shower before it really kicks in. I walked upstairs into my room and like a typical person high on shrooms, by the time I had gotten into my room I had no idea how much time had passed. My phone was downstairs so I just went ahead and just hopped in the shower. I closed my eyes and I started to see a vast array of Aztec patterns. They were different shapes and sizes, colorful and for some reason hilarious. I opened my eyes so I could sit down (there is a built in kind of a seat in my shower). Even though I was high af, I was still very aware that I was in my shower etc.

So to help me get to that next level, I decided to turn off the lights, the bathroom fan and the water in the shower. I figured if I cut out all the distractions, even for a few minutes, it might help. I know.. great idea.

So there I was, chillin in a pitch black, silent, shower like any normal human being. I proceeded to rest my head in my hands so I could be somewhat comfortable closed my eyes and tried to find those Aztec shapes again. I was able to find them almost immediately and this time they were far more vibrant and in far greater numbers. As the patterns got more and more intense, I lost all feeling of my body and I felt as if I was just floating. The shapes disappeared and I thought maybe I was back in my shower again but I still couldn‚Äôt feel my body and it was really dark. I had lost all ties to reality. I felt like I was in a dream, so I treated the situation as if I was in a very lucid dream.

I was floating around and everything around me looked as if I was in a dark cave, then I saw giant gargoyles. Just minding their own business. For whatever reason I didn‚Äôt feel afraid I was just like, wow 20 foot gargoyles and they didn‚Äôt seem to notice me so I felt safe.

‚ÄúThis bad trip, isn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù I foolishly thought to myself.

Next thing I know I straight up can‚Äôt breathe.

I had a close to drowning experience when I was about 7 that I seemed to have forgotten about until now and at this point, the experience in my trip felt equally as shitty and if not, more terrifying than that memory as a child.

I was still convinced I was in a dream so I calmed myself down thinking ‚Äúhey man, you just have to wait this out and you‚Äôll wake up‚Äù. The feeling of drowning became stronger and stronger. I tried my best to snap out of it and eventually came to the realization ""oh fuck this isn‚Äôt a dream‚Äù.

‚ÄúMaybe I just fell over in the shower and am literally drowning in my own shower like an idiot.‚Äù

But I was certain I turned the shower off.

‚ÄúWell maybe I just fell over in a really weird position?‚Äù

Even with impending doom my high brain was trying to find a way to be able to convince myself that everything would be okay and to remain calm even it‚Äôs just for a few more seconds. But I began to feel this incredible pain in my rib cage as if every rib was breaking from the force of my intercostal muscles flexing so hard due to the fact my body is desperate for oxygen. I started to feel an overwhelming amount of fear/panic/pain all at once. I was trying my best not to freak out but knew I had about 5 seconds of remaining calm left in me and there was nothing I could do about it.

After a few more minutes of this great experience I came to the terms that I am in fact about to die in my shower. But at this point I don‚Äôt care I just wanted this experience to end. I began to see a small white light and thought ‚ÄúReally? The stereo type is true??‚Äù

Everything went pitch black and I saw a pin prick of white light. But I felt incredibly calm.

I then felt like I experienced another stereotypical phenomenon of seeing my life flash before my eyes. I could feel my entire life all at once. The best way I can put it into words is that it was like watching a high light reel of my entire life. Except it was like simultaneously looking at thousands and thousands of TVs, hearing them all at once and having the ability to take it all in as well. I felt this in-explainable surge of emotions. Some things I was able to focus on were some childhood memories that I had never recalled since that time in my life. They weren‚Äôt anything significant it would just be me walking in our backyard or something simple like that.

I started to think well maybe I didn‚Äôt die and that I have just become insane. I again began to see only the white light and it was getting bigger and bigger until all I could see was a bright light that encompassed everything. Then it disappeared and I saw pure darkness again. I had one last thought of, ‚ÄúDamn it I can‚Äôt believe I died in my shower.‚Äù But I realized, it‚Äôs too late for it to even matter so who cares?

‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm just dead‚Äù

I felt totally fine with this and began to wonder how long I would be stuck in this void? What am I even? My soul? I had so many questions with no source of answers. I did however feel that, everything is going to be totally fine. So I felt calm.

I felt like I had been here before, that the void wasn‚Äôt 100% foreign. So, I continued to float around contemplating thoughts for what felt like years. I had no idea what day, month or year it was and I felt like I was in this solitary state for decades.

The entire concept of who I am, or was, was long gone. To me it felt like I ‚Äúdied‚Äù so many years ago. It was enough time that I had moved on and accepted my current reality of being this particle of energy or whatever I was floating in this void. I felt like I was waiting for my next life but I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would be a person, or if I would even be on the same planet, or if I would just be floating around for another 9789 years. The longer I spent floating around though, the more I felt like I was in a familiar place.

Then I heard breathing‚Ä¶.

It got louder and louder and I felt a glimmer of hope. ‚ÄúAm I coming back to life?‚Äù I still couldn‚Äôt feel anything but I could hear breathing and I could somehow control it. This made no sense to me but I just kept breathing. I began to felt my right foot reforming, bone by bone. The sensation felt similar to that feeling of cracking your knuckles. An oddly satisfying relief. I could feel each part of my foot come back it was so strange but I didn‚Äôt care. Next I felt my right leg coming in. My breathing was getting louder and louder. Trying to maintain my breathing felt like it required the same amount of focus as when you are in a dream and are trying to stay calm so you don‚Äôt wake up.

As I felt my leg forming I heard a voice that asked me ‚Äúwhy are you here?‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt heard a voice for years so it caught me off guard and I didn‚Äôt respond. I just felt overcome with frustration as I couldn‚Äôt even think of an answer.

The voice asked again ‚Äúwhy are you here?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure‚Äù and as I said that I felt my body collapse and I ‚Äúdied again‚Äù

This time I was able to wake up from the void a lot faster. I found myself sitting back in my shower but everything was distorted. I knew I was definitely still high af. But I could at least recognize where I was so I was thrilled. Then I started hearing voices. I couldn‚Äôt distinguish what they were saying, but they continued and I started to hear more and more. They were loud whispers and then they got louder and louder until it felt like headphones on maximum volume +5. I couldn‚Äôt figure out where it was coming from and it freaked me out bad. I thought to myself, I may not have died but I fucked my brain up.

The voices continued for what felt like an eternity until I yelled ‚Äújust shut up!!!!!‚Äù and to my surprise, they did. I finally enjoyed some peace and tranquility. I listened to my own breathing, being so grateful that it‚Äôs all over. This lasted for about 30 seconds and everything went pitch black and I was back in the void. Guess I died again?

I didn‚Äôt care, anything was better than the voices so I welcomed this familiar form of just being a floating energy particle. Since I had a moment where I could think rationally for a second, I desperately tried to piece together any information I could to bring me back to some kind of reality to get out of the trip.

How long ago did I take the mushrooms? How long have I been high? How long ago did it feel like I drowned? Were the gargoyles a dream I had a week ago? What about the voices? The more I tried to find a way back to reality the further I was drifting into the void.

I entered a repeated cycle of events that were as follows:

1. I saw my entire life again but sped up until the point where I took a large dose of mushrooms. It would take what felt like a few minutes to get to this point. But each time I could process and feel every experience I‚Äôve ever had. It was very strange. Once it got to the point of me weighing the mushrooms the ‚Äúhighlight reel‚Äù would slow down to real life time for a few minutes.
2. After I drink the tea thankfully it would sped up again I feel my body reforming.
3. I would hear a voice ask me ‚Äúwhy am I here‚Äù and I would always reply ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù
4. I would then Die and steps 1 to 3 would repeat.

Each time that the cycle re-started I would take a larger and larger dose of mushrooms. It 20 grams, then 30, then 40, all the way up to 100 and so on. Each time I was reforming I would regenerate more and more of my body. The reforming part was also in real time. The ‚Äúwhy are you here‚Äù part was also in real time and each time I was asked the question I got a little bit closer to knowing the answer. As the cycles continued I could feel it on the tip of my tongue. I was so close. I felt like I knew it but just forgot briefly. I was so frustrated. How could I let something slip out of my mind??!

I tried as hard as I could to remember and angrily yelled out ‚Äú I DON‚ÄôT KNOW‚Äù and prepared to ‚Äúdie‚Äù for the 310861523824th time.

I paused for a moment in the void and thought ‚Äúokay, I definitely died and now I‚Äôm in hell.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt fear I felt at this point any more but the sheer frustration of getting so close to finding ‚Äúthe answer‚Äù each time and coming up short every time. I had been tripping for what felt like decades or centuries. I thought for sure, I‚Äôm dead, in hell and I‚Äôm never going to get out of this cycle.

Then as I was reforming for the 310861523825th time and I got to the point where I could feel my entire body. I was so excited but had to remain calm because I didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù or in this case ‚Äúdie‚Äù. Then I saw nothing a pin prick show up in the black void. That damn little stereotype light, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be so happy to see it. It had been centuries.

I could hear my breathing getting louder and louder and with each breath the light got bigger and bigger. I started to hear voices again, but this time they were cheering me on and yelling at me.

‚ÄúKEEP BREATHING KEEP BREATHING‚Äù

It felt like I was running a race, breathing was so exhausting. Just when I thought I had nothing left in the tank I heard that son of a bitch again, ‚Äúwhy are you here??‚Äù this time though, it was getting drowned out by the sound of the people yelling and my own breathing. I ignored it and focused on the feeling of my body. I focused on my arms and hands. I opened and closed my fists. I could feel every bone in my hand crack like Bruce lee getting ready to lay the smack down. I then focused all my energy on trying to find a handle in my shower so I could pull myself up.

I felt it!

I did everything I could to pull myself up. As I stood up I couldn‚Äôt feel one of my legs and got worried.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just asleep from sitting down for so long, wait a minute‚Äù

So I waited a bit and felt my leg reform all at once. I slid open the glass door and slowly walked out and opened the bathroom door to my room and felt a windstorm like cool gust blow in my face. It was the most refreshing feeling I had ever felt in my life. I was still heavily breathing and I it was pitch black in my room too. I turned on my bedroom light.

Everything appeared to be normal. I walked back to the bathroom. I turned on the light. Everything was normal.

I looked at myself in the mirror. I appeared to be normal. Pupils still mid dilated. Was it over? Was it finally over? I saw my reflection in the mirror and it was me still, but at age 8 then 80 and then back to my current age. I took a few deep breaths. I was back to normal. I left the lights on and took a shower.

Afterwards things were still back to normal. All signs pointed to me being out of the trip and sobering up. I walked downstairs and all I could think about was how long was I out for? Had it been a day? A week? Were people trying to get a hold of me? I was anxious to check my phone. I took a look and turns out what felt like hundreds of lifetimes was in reality only about 4.5 hours.

I breathed a deep sigh of relief. Smoked a joint and relaxed for the rest of the evening. It was officially over!

2022-09-26 16:22:47,I have some serious concerns about the mental health of a large portion of this community.,"The amount of statements and interactions I've seen here that come across as psychotic/manic is insane. Not to mention how closed-minded many here are about their psychedelic-induced ideas. There's a fine line between firmly believing in something and being so unreasonably defensive about it that it comes across as strange. 

I'm pro psychedelic use (recreational and therapeutic), believe me I've talked people's heads off about it, but I think this subreddit unfortunately often demonstrates the potential dangers of abusing these drugs instead of using them responsibly. If you're consistently posting grandiose meaningless psychedelic babble, proclaiming yourself to be a god, and/or denying science, to me it sounds very much like posters on r/stims deep into a binge. It might be worth considering a mental health assessment.

This is by no means the whole community. I'm not trying to stereotype or generalize. I just can't scroll this sub without seeing an uncomfortable amount of it, felt like it was worth addressing. It's okay to stay in touch with the other side, just don't forget to stay in touch with this one too.

2020-02-06 06:05:08,dmt first time - what to expect,"What to expect when taking DMT:

1. What to expect - expect a 10-15 minute experience. What this experience will be depends on the product quantity and quality; set and setting; method of consumption; and your body. More about the experience below...
2. Safety - you cannot have a physical death from DMT. There are no recorded cases of people dying from the compound. Do it in a safe space and you'll be fine. You cannot overdose on it either because you will literally pass out after a few tokes and physically won't be capable of taking anymore. To get to dangerous toxicity levels, you will need to consume x1000 times the average dose, which is physically impossible to do for reasons pointed out above.
3. Only 5% of people get to the breakthrough. How do you know if you've broken through? You WILL know when it happens. If in doubt, it didn't happen. It is such an astonishing event that you cannot confuse it with anything else or doubt about it. Why such a small percentage get to breakthrough? Because most people burn the product and thus don't get enough. DMT must be melted, not burnt. Best to use Mighty vaporizer at 350f temperature setting with concentrate tab at the bottom of the bowl and DMT on top of it. You would take 3 or more full lung tokes within 60 seconds. 1 toke, hold 20 seconds. Then 2nd toke, hold 20 seconds. Then 3rd toke, hold 20 seconds. Problem is that after the first two tokes you get in a place called the Waiting Room or a Lobby and your mind is dazzled so much that you forget to take on last toke required to breakthrough.

There are three stages that you may experience:

1. Comeup. After the first toke, you will see the world around you become fluid. Your surroundings will start moving, breathing, textured things will become animated. That's this reality beginning to shatter for you.

After second or third toke, you may see beautiful colourful geometric shapes, mandalas, unearthly flowers projected over things you're looking at. You begin to peak into the reality beyond our own. Warmth will engulf your body, almost a sexual sensation. You will feel someone's presence with you. They are always there with you watching you - so don't be afraid. Be mindful of your thoughts as thoughts become reality in this realm pretty quickly. Meaning you will amplify your thoughts in this state. So think positive, absorb everything you see, never-ever be scared of what you see - there's nothing there that can hurt you. Be inquisitive, curious, but never fearful. Then you may see a sudden deafening silence or a gong-like ringing in your ears that will become progressively stronger until your reality around your shatters and you will jump into the Waiting Room.

2. Waiting Room. This is a mesmerizing experience. Your mind will be so mesmerized that you'll forget what you were doing before. This room serves the purpose of entertaining you whilst you wait the transition to another place or come back. This waiting room is made of geometric shapes, multi-dimensional things that morph into itself. You may encounter some beings there. The whole purpose of them is to entertain you while you wait to be transitioned further on or return to your own reality. It is very important to do that one last full toke after that. It will be very hard to do because your mind will be completely mesmerized by the experience you've never seen in your life! There may be time dilation as well, meaning time will flow, stop or reverse, or loop. You may sense your breathing stop or it will take forever between breaths. Do not be alarmed, you are not dead, this is your perception of time that changed but you're still alive. If you force yourself to make that one last full toke, then you off to an experience that's called...

3. Breakthrough. Most people do not go beyond the Waiting Room because they burn the product or cannot hold on to the smoke for the required amount or because they're so mesmerized by the experience that they forget to take that one last toke. But once you do - the Waiting Room will shatter, the lights around you will form around you in a tunnel and you will be catapulted through that tunnel with super-light speed. The sensation is like the craziest roller coaster ride you've ever taken or bungee jumping or being catapulted using huge slingshot. You will know when you have Breakthrough. If people are asking themselves if they had Breakthrough or not - it wasn't a Breakthrough. It's undeniable and you'll know it. At the other end of the tunnel awaits the universe that is beyond words! It is more real than the reality you've known whilst in your body. It is so multidimensional (more than 3 dimensions), therefore words cannot describe it. You will feel at home, you will remember that place as you've been there before. This is where we all go. There will be other beings very happy to see you return! Many other things will happen there. You have to experience it, no words can describe it. All your questions will be answered there, you will know everything! Nothing will be hidden from you. No more secrets. Time does not exist there, so you may only spend there minutes but it will feel like hours, days, months, ages...

4. Comedown. After the effects dissipate, you will slowly come down to your reality like a feather coming down slowly and gently down to earth. You may open your eyes, you will have some afterglow meaning you may still see the room you're in breathing slightly and objects animated, textured surfaces become something else, colourful things may still superimpose onto your reality. Within a few minutes, it will all end, and many things that were communicated to you in the Breakthrough will be forgotten as well, like sands going through your fingers. This is normal. You're not supposed to bring all that knowledge back with you into your reality.

5. The long-term aftereffects. Once you've opened that door, it always remains opened. Meaning it will become easier to get there the more you go there. Also, you will become to sense and observe things you haven't been able to before in your reality. Those things are called synchronicities. Subtle clues that indicate everything is connected, all the events and all things - as they are supposed to be. Examples of synchronicities, you think or speak of something and then it appears in your life, you see it on the street the same day, the same week.

2018-05-26 20:23:36,8 insights from a 200ug trip,"
1. Social media should be avoided as much as possible. It only commoditizes our attention and holds it for as long as it can, distracting us from the present moment. 

2. The human mind creates the structure of the human experience. Our brain‚Äôs limitations create the illusion of separation between us and what we observe. 

3. Acid forces us into the present moment by extending our senses and making the ‚Äòvibrancy‚Äô of life more evident and apparent to us. This encourages us to stay in the present. 

4. Acid makes our thoughts come and go in our heads very fast. We do not need to chase and follow these thoughts, we have the power to simply observe them. 

5. The very nature of language is incredibly restrictive and even conducive to the ego illusion. However, it is clearly necessary for today‚Äôs world. 

6. People‚Äôs interactions with each other are typically EXTREMELY egocentric. This is okay and cannot be avoided, but one should be conscious of it. 

7. Acid softens the ego temporarily and it is natural for it to resist the psychedelic experience, but a conscious effort to let go and remain present will go a long way. 

8. The act of killing or inflicting suffering on others is pointless because you are only hurting yourself. ",28,1244,6,216,1

2019-03-10 06:05:09,Took LSD and contacted my mother who I have not spoken to in 7 years,"Yesterday was my 20th birthday. I have not spoken to my mother in 7 years due to a whirlwind childhood story where I ended up cutting off contact with her. Talking to her again has been on my mind the past couple months and I knew she would text me on birthday. Well, my plans that day was to take LSD for the first time with my friends and have a bomb ass time.

 I saw her text before I took the tabs and didn't really acknowledge it as I have in the past. That night after probably 5 hours of tripping, we were at the pool in my apartment at night enjoying ourselves when a young woman and I believe her daughter came down. I instantly felt a shift in my mood seeing them and got in a sad thought loop about how my mother and I used to be when I was that age. I was holding back crying in front of everyone and told them we had to go back up to my room. I hopped in the shower and had an intense cry and letting everything out from so many years and realizing it was time to reach out. 

I'm glad I reached back out to her and ended the silence, I don't regret it at all, even though I have been hesitant for the past couple years. It has been something I've held back for a long time and the LSD broke down my ego and I saw everything with more empathy. I called my dad (who had no idea I was tripping) because I needed to hear his voice and let him know. He was very happy to hear that I did it and I was able to stop crying and calm down when I talked to him. 

Letting everything out in this moment was huge for me and I felt incredible and so much relief after this big cry I had, and I was able to enjoy the rest of the night with my friends. 

EDIT: also didn‚Äôt mention I was raised by my grandma (dad‚Äôs mom) who I‚Äôm very close with. Couple questions asked why I cut off my mom at 13‚Äìlong story short she had me at age 20 and couldn‚Äôt support me well. She then ended up having kids with two different men after me so I have two half brothers somewhere out there that she also didn‚Äôt raise. But now that I am 20 I can see how difficult it would be to have kids at this age and that she was really lost in the world.

2016-01-06 20:06:39,One of the best pieces of advise I've ever heard in relation to your life's purpose.,"In April of 1958, a 22 year-old Hunter S. Thompson wrote a letter on the meaning of life when asked by a friend for advice. What makes his response all the more profound is the fact that at the time, the world had no idea that he would become one of the most important writers of the 20th century. Therefore his beliefs about purpose were hypothetical‚Äîthey were statements of faith.

But if it‚Äôs true that our beliefs really do become our reality, then there‚Äôs no better example of a life fully realised than the one of Hunter S. Thompson. Let his perspective inspire you:

‚Ä¶

April 22, 1958

57 Perry Street

New York City

Dear Hume,

You ask advice: ah, what a very human and very dangerous thing to do! For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal ‚Äî to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.

I am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.

‚ÄúTo be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether ‚Äôtis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù (Shakespeare)

And indeed, that IS the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal. It is a choice we must all make consciously or unconsciously at one time in our lives. So few people understand this! Think of any decision you‚Äôve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don‚Äôt see how it could have been anything but a choice however indirect ‚Äî between the two things I‚Äôve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.

But why not float if you have no goal? That is another question. It is unquestionably better to enjoy the floating than to swim in uncertainty. So how does a man find a goal? Not a castle in the stars, but a real and tangible thing. How can a man be sure he‚Äôs not after the ‚Äúbig rock candy mountain,‚Äù the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?

The answer ‚Äî and, in a sense, the tragedy of life ‚Äî is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It‚Äôs not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.

So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?

The answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on ‚Äúthe meaning of man‚Äù and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term ‚Äúgod only knows‚Äù purely as an expression.) There‚Äôs very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I‚Äôm the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.

I‚Äôm going to steer clear of the word ‚Äúexistentialism,‚Äù but you might keep it in mind as a key of sorts. You might also try something called ‚ÄúBeing and Nothingness‚Äù by Jean-Paul Sartre, and another little thing called ‚ÄúExistentialism: From Dostoyevsky to Sartre.‚Äù These are merely suggestions. If you‚Äôre genuinely satisfied with what you are and what you‚Äôre doing, then give those books a wide berth. (Let sleeping dogs lie.) But back to the answer. As I said, to put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.

But don‚Äôt misunderstand me. I don‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt BE firemen, bankers, or doctors ‚Äî but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires ‚Äî including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.

As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal), he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).

In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life ‚Äî the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.

Let‚Äôs assume that you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow (all pre-defined paths, of course). And let‚Äôs assume that you can‚Äôt see any real purpose in any of the eight. THEN ‚Äî and here is the essence of all I‚Äôve said ‚Äî you MUST FIND A NINTH PATH.

Naturally, it isn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds. You‚Äôve lived a relatively narrow life, a vertical rather than a horizontal existence. So it isn‚Äôt any too difficult to understand why you seem to feel the way you do. But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.

So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where to look; I don‚Äôt know what to look for.‚Äù

And there‚Äôs the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by DECIDING TO LOOK, you go a long way toward making the choice.

If I don‚Äôt call this to a halt, I‚Äôm going to find myself writing a book. I hope it‚Äôs not as confusing as it looks at first glance. Keep in mind, of course, that this is MY WAY of looking at things. I happen to think that it‚Äôs pretty generally applicable, but you may not. Each of us has to create our own credo ‚Äî this merely happens to be mine.

If any part of it doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense, by all means call it to my attention. I‚Äôm not trying to send you out ‚Äúon the road‚Äù in search of Valhalla, but merely pointing out that it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that ‚Äî no one HAS to do something he doesn‚Äôt want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that‚Äôs what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You‚Äôll have lots of company.

And that‚Äôs it for now. Until I hear from you again, I remain,

your friend,

Hunter",84,8269,16,1573,1

repost of something cool:

[Terrance Mckenna on Philip K. Dick (author of Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall, etc). /by deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/70armf/terrance_mckenna_on_philip_k_dick_author_of_blade/)

[...] Phil wasn‚Äôt nuts. Phil was a vortex victim. Schizophrenia is not a psychological disorder peculiar to human beings. Schizophrenia is not a disease at all but rather a localized traveling discontinuity of the space time matrix itself. It is like a travelling whirl-wind of radical understanding that haunts time. It haunts time in the same way that Alfred North Whitehead said that the color dove grey ""haunts time like a ghost.""

There is an idea that wants to be born, it has wanted to be born for a very long time. And sometimes that longing to be born seffles on a person. For no damn good reason. Then you‚Äôre ""it,"" you become the cheese, and the cheese stands alone. You are illuminated and maddened and lifted up by something great beyond all telling. It wants to be told. It‚Äôs just that this idea is so damn big that it can‚Äôt be told, or rather the whole of history is the telling of this idea, the stuttering rambling effort of the sons and daughters of poor old Noah to tell this blinding, reality-shattering, bowel-loosening truth. And Phil had a piece of the action, a major piece of the action.

But I anticipate myself. Those who grasp a piece of the action end up with two things on their plate; the experience and their own idiosyncratic explanation of the experience based on what they have read, seen and been told.

The experience is private, personal, the best part, and ultimately unspeakable. The more you know the quieter you get. The explanation is another matter and can be attempted. In fact it must be told, for the Logos speaks and we are its tools and its voice. Phil says a lot of things in the Exegesis, he is aware that he says too much, so he keeps trying to boil it down to ten points or twelve parts or whatever. I have my own experience, equally unspeakable, and my explanation, equally prolix. Phil (sometimes) thought he was Christ,* I (sometimes) thought I was an extraterrestrial invader disguised as a meadow mushroom. What matters is the system that eventually emerges, not the fantasies concerning the source of the system. When I compare Phil‚Äôs system to mine, my hair stands on end. We were both contacted by the same unspeakable something. Two madmen dancing, not together, but the same dance anyhow.

Truth or madness, you be the judge. What is trying to be expressed is this: The world is not real. Reality is not stranger than you suppose, it is stranger than you can suppose. Time is not what you think it is. Reality is a hologram. Being is a solid state matrix and psychosis is the redemptive process ne plus ultra. The real truth is splintered and spread throughout time.

Appearances are a vast and interlocking lie. To finally know the Logos truly, if that means anything, is to know it as for, as what Phil called a ""unified abstract structure."" In a way this was where PKD went wrong. It wasn‚Äôt his fault. He saw that the world of 1975 was a fiction and behind that fiction was the world of AD 45. But he lacked an essential concept, lacked it because it really hadn‚Äôt been invented yet. Anyhow the man was a SF writer and a scholar of classical philosophy, he could not be expected to stay in touch with arcane discoveries beginning to take place on the frontiers of research mathematics. But he got very close, his intuition was red hot when he reached the conclusion that a unified abstract structure lay behind the shifting always tricky casuistry of appearances. The concept he needed was that of fractals and fractal mathematics. The infinite regress of form built out of forms of itself built out of forms of itself unto infinity. The principle of self similarity. Phil was right, time is not a linear river. He was right, the Empire never ended. Parallel universes is too simple a concept to encompass what is really going on. The megamacrocosmos is a system of resonances, of levels, of endlessly adumbrated fun-house reflections. PKD really was Thomas and Elijah and all the other precursive concrescences that came together to make the cat-loving fat man who compacted trash into gold. The logic of being that he sought, and largely found, was not an either-or logic but a both-and and and-and kind of logic.

[PKD was never more right than when he wrote:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5t7c8h/the_exegesis_of_p_k_dick/)

"" I actually had to develop a love of the disordered & puzzling, viewing reality as a vast riddle to be joyfully tackled, not in fear but with tireless fascination. What has been most needed is reality testing, & a willingness to face the possibility of self-negating experiences: i.e., real contradictions, with something being both true & not true.The enigma is alive, aware of us, & changing. It is partly created by our own minds: we alter it by perceiving it, since we are not outside it. As our views shift, it shifts. In a sense it is not there at all (acosmism). In another sense it is a vast intelligence: in another sense it is total harmonia and structure (how logically can. it be all three? Well, it is).""

One cannot learn these things. One can only be told these things. And it is the Logos that does the telling [...] Almost as if the counter flow, the occluding intelligence, kept Phil‚Äôs eyes diverted from the key element necessary to the universal decipherment that he was attempting. Time is a fractal, or has a fractal structure. All times, moments, months and millennia, have a pattern; the same pattern. This pattern is the structure within which, upon which, events ""undergo the formality of actually occurring,"" as Whitehead used to say. The pattern recurs on every level. A love affair, the fall of an empire, the death agony of a protozoan, all occur within the context of this always the same but ever different pattern. All events are resonances of other events, in other parts of time, and at other scales of time.

[...] What is important is that the birth of this idea is now very near, has in fact already happened, and PKD showed the way. The answer is found. And this incredible genius, this gentle, long-suffering, beauty-worshipping man showed the way. When it counted he was right. All hail Philip K. Dick.

It's also a must that this community-oriented system is supportive of all of us, while we contribute to each other a foundation that allows us to look at the stars and not think, ""What is there more to life than this?"", but to think, ""I wouldn't want to have anything more than what we give to life, and what she gives back to us.""

And I cry sometimes, when I'm either drunk, or when I'm very high, or when I'm tripping balls, because I want this to be a future for humanity, and I think we all kind of do, even the one's addicted to power and money who are delusional and destructive from their highs... they too, but for them it's lost in the back of their heads.

But ever since I've come to this realization, being high has felt calming, but also surreal and melancholy. It's like the plant medicines of the world want to show us a reality we could live, but we are lost in our own mental constructs of what the world *should* be like.

So I'll smoke to that, in hopes of a world for future generations to experience that type of world, and I'll be their ancestor that supports it... but if a future generation isn't able to inherit that world, then I hope we all as souls will find each other on a world that the cannabis, the mushrooms, the LSD, and even sometimes a good glass of wine, will show us about.

2019-08-29 08:39:42,Psychedelics show you how subjective your reality really is,"After having a few weeks to reflect on my first LSD trip, I realize that the effects of LSD are still present in my waking life and that they may have even in some way been there even beforehand. Even small doses can have long lasting effects on how you perceive the world.


Now, the dose was low at only 50ug, and the visual effects were very subtle, but I remember looking in the mirror, trying to see something interesting in my face. First, I noticed making faces at myself was very fun; I could intensely change my emotional state on a dime just my flexing my facial muscles up and down. Then, my eyes, nose and mouth all separated and my face disappeared, leaving only features floating in the mirror. Then when my face came back, I let my eyes glaze over and tried to take it in as a whole. Patterns EVERYWHERE. My brain is a pattern recognition machine. When it works too well, you'll see patterns where no patterns exist. 


Much stronger than the visual effects though, are the cognitive ones. If you realized your senses were completely fake on LSD, then you'll definitely recognize how shallow and easily manipulated your inner state is as well. After much reflection on my trip, I realized just how much control I have over my emotions, my opinions, and my perception in general even when completely sober. All the things I thought were just inherent to my nature and untameable, were suddenly just as wibbly-wobbly as the patterns I saw behind my eyelids.


I mean everyone's looked up at the sky and saw animals and other weird shit in the clouds, especially as a kid. Kids will see everything in the clouds; Cars, animals, faces. As adults we may forget how to do just that, maybe the clouds just start looking like clouds. But that's because we think there's no time to see things in the clouds; we got other shit to think about. If we take a long enough look, you'll start to see life in the clouds again.


My opinions, my feelings, my thoughts are just as subjective as whatever I might see in those clouds. Knowing this, I was able to unshackle myself of all my past anxieties and fears that had ruled over me for such a large part of my life.


Now, there's no song or piece of music I can't enjoy. There's always some aspect to it that I can find to enjoy. And why wouldn't I want to enjoy all music anyway? Why would we allow ourselves to be annoyed by a bunch of noise anyway? It's just noise after all.


This works with any emotion too. When you recognize that your emotions are completely in your control, there's never any reason to be angry, sad or anxious ever again. You can see good in pretty much anything or anyone. Why choose to be ruled over by negative emotions when happiness is so much more preferable? Now anything and everything can make me laugh or smile. I'd go so as far to say that happiness is a choice, and I never really internalized that before taking LSD.

And whatever mood you're in has a HUGE effect on how you perceive the world and other people. It's extremely comforting to know how much control I have over my mood at any given time. When you know nothing you experience is real, you gain total control over your experience. It's completely subjective, and now everything is beautiful.",59,3244,9,592,1

2022-05-26 14:32:54,Am I an asshole for saying mean things to my dmt to prove my hippie friend wrong?,"Okay this is gonna sound weird so bare with me. I extract small amounts of dmt sometimes, and give it away to friends. I have a friend who's super into energy and crystals and wook stuff, and I gave him a dose to try. He told me it was good, but he could sense some bad energy behind it and suggested the next batch I make, to give it positive affirmations, and cleanse the energy in the room with sage and crystals

So the next batch I made, I played death metal (cannibal corpse, specifically. If you're not familiar their songs are about torture, necrophilia, cannibalism and other fun stuff) and said horrible mean things to my glassware and ingredients as I extracted. I flipped it off as I scraped the dmt and told it its worthless and nobody will ever love it. Basically tried to fill the room with the absolute worst vibes ever. But on a chemical level, it was exactly the same. No additives or anything, I even purified it 3x to create the best possible product. 

Gave my buddy a dose of it but told him that while it was being made, I played healing music and frequencies, set up a crystal healing grid around it and cleansed the room with sage while changing positive affirmations.

He said it was the best dmt trip he's ever had and that he could sense the love, good vibes and healing that went into making it, then gave me a big hug and said ""thank you for imparting your good energy into this medicine, and then into me, I'll make sure to pay it forward into the universe""

I mostly did this to demonstrate the power of expectation and mindset in subjective experience, not to be a dick. I'm not gonna tell my friend what I did because I have no interest in squashing anybody's beliefs. Im personally a more objective, scientific person, but I used to be deep into the whole spiritual side of psychedelics when I was a teenager, so I understand where he's coming from. I mean no disrespect and would never be a dick about anyone's beliefs as long as they're not hurting anyone, but thought it would be an interesting experiment in psychology 

I wanted to test for myself whether or not the energy put in affects the experience, and it seems likely that it doesn't, but rather our expectations, and mindset play the biggest role",81,2244,17,412,1

2019-12-01 12:06:07,How LSD Got Me Out of Wage Slavery and Changed My Life Completely,"Hello everyone, 

I want to tell you about my experience with LSD and how it changed my life 180¬∞. 

Last year, I was **depressed**, working for a corporation that didn't give a fuck about me. I was living in a big, expensive city and I had a low paying job even though I was a lawyer. Every day was full of anxiety, fear about my future and economy of the country I live in (I live in a third world country). 

I've always loved LSD and taken some really high doses before and always seen it as a teacher. During one trip, LSD clearly showed me that I was a **wage slave**. I didn't have any freedom. I was at the mercy of my boss and I was weak. I was living in a dusty city with air pollution, high buildings, no oxygen, and no nature. This was very bad for my health and my dog who could only spend a little time outside because I was working a lot.  

It also showed me that the friend I was tripping with was fucked by the current system. He was hooked on **porn, shit food, sugar, and money**. His bad physical appearance (his belly, weight, and even teeth) was clearly caused by his bad eating habits. LSD was showing me the inner self of my friend, which was not good at all. 

There was no doubt this was **one of the most unsettling experiences** in my life. I had some existential issues and questioned everything about my life. But during the trip, I had an urge to change everything about my life. (not that I had bad habits at the time, but I was getting nowhere even though had discipline and good habits)  

After the trip, I was very depressed for a while. However, I was hopeful that **I could change my life** since I've always believed acid shows you the right way. First, I cut out my loser friends who were on the wrong path including my friend I was tripping with. I didn't have anything against them but they clearly had a bad effect on me. 

Then, I decided to find something I could do other than my current job. I searched Reddit and found a way to make money online by creating websites, which I've never had an experience before. I was already hating my job, so I decided to give it a shot by quitting and giving my full effort to it. 

Today, it is almost a year later after all those things happened. I am making almost **three times more than the old salary** that I had in my soul-sucking job. I am making money in Dollars, which is very advantageous for a person who lives in a third world country.  I am doing something I love and I don't even have to go to work. Honestly, I don't even have to work at all since it is passive income, I just work because I love doing it. 

I moved out of the big city I was living in because I didn't have to.  I moved to a **beautiful coastal city**, where the rents are very cheap. I made some new friends. I am still in contact with my old friends who had bad habits but now, we have a distant relationship. I **spend 2-3 hours in nature every day with my dog**, which was something I learned I should do during the trips. I have much more free time, which allows me to pursue my other hobbies such as learning Spanish, scuba diving and yoga. 

I still can't believe how LSD turned my life completely around. What a learning tool, what a drug! It can show you a lot of things that your undeveloped monkey brain doesn't understand. 

My point is, never have a resistance to the bad trips. Because LSD and other psychedelics shows you the truth, and truth can be very unsettling at the time. See them as learning tools and don't wait for a good drug experience. Because they are not here for that. They are here to help you and it might be a way other than the way you expect it. Just accept everything by surrendering and I believe good things will happen. 

Trip safe guys:)",65,3747,13,716,1

2020-08-20 15:30:57,Are more people doing psychedelics as of recent?,"By ‚Äúrecent‚Äù I mean in the past 5-10 years. It seems to me that there has been an increase in the amount of people taking psychedelics, specifically LSD and mushrooms. People that I know personally who wouldn‚Äôt have even talked about psychedelics a few years ago are now becoming psychonauts. Multiple hip hop artists who I listen to have done psychedelics, where just a few years ago they were most likely deemed ‚Äúweird‚Äù within the hip hop community. You even see them being discussed more in the mainstream (60 minutes special, Netflix documentaries, medical studies/research). Maybe psychs have been popular all along, but people are becoming more open about them? Obviously they were popularized in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, but you don‚Äôt hear much about psychedelic culture from the 80‚Äôs- current day. Now I feel like that is changing and they are making a huge, huge comeback (yay üòÅ).",48,882,8,149,1
2020-07-17 15:11:18,I‚Äôm a sculptor. After the peak on 200ug lsd something I made became a little gateway into the divine. Pics inside.,"I‚Äôve been sculpting since 2002. I‚Äôve posted elsewhere about the journey I‚Äôve been on, it‚Äôs been incredibly intense at times. To summarise, I hated myself for most of my adult life, from my teens until age 36, in 2017. The only constructive pursuit I had was sculpture. I made a lot of weird stuff, [like this carved from chalk in '04](https://i.imgur.com/f75AaoS.jpg), but most of the time I was drinking heavily and smoking pot to escape myself. In 2015 I discovered that modelling in clay while drunk and high was a lot of fun; I didn‚Äôt have to worry about whether it was good or not, I could just express myself and let the chips fall. 

It turned out to be incredibly cathartic, [my darkest emotions](https://i.imgur.com/3tdkRim.jpeg) poured out of me into the work and what I made helped me understand what I was struggling with. Because I was in such a chaotic state I wasn‚Äôt thinking about what I made and it flowed straight out of my subconscious, allowing me to explore the contents. In September 2017 [I made a rabbit](https://i.imgur.com/SN8GwsY.jpg) that came right out of my heart, it felt like a deep part of me that I‚Äôd repressed. He‚Äôs so adorable I fell in love with him and this allowed me to love myself for the first time in my life. I feel like I poured my heart out until the waters ran clear.

After that I had a few visions, some while stoned and some while sober. The most powerful one happened when I went to bed early for work one night, put my head down and as soon as I shut my eyes I was standing in darkness. I felt a presence behind me and turned around to see a bipedal rabbit about ten feet high staring down at me with wide shining eyes and a big smile on his face. The smile was intense but benevolent; he looked a bit like Bugs but there were no teeth showing and the expression wasn‚Äôt sly, it was open and friendly. He raised his giant forepaws and put them on my chest which sent a shock through me that left me lying in bed again. 

I‚Äôve been trying to express this rabbit spirit in clay ever since (to eventually carve it in stone). I know it was a hallucination, but that doesn‚Äôt change its power or significance to me. I‚Äôve made many studies since this happened almost 3 years ago, from 2 inches to three feet high. Most were just stepping stones and I discarded them, and others, [like this one](https://imgur.com/a/3KGF0sT), I molded and cast into resin (the 2nd pic has an explanation of what it's meant to be cause it's a bit chaotic and no-one ever gets it). I recently came across a source of acid for the first time since I was 21 and thought it was a great opportunity to go deeper, so I set out all the casts and current models on a big table and when the right moment came I drank the liquid provided. 

I came up in about 20 minutes. I‚Äôll skim over the peak because this is already long ‚Äì basically the main model I had all my hope in became a hideous beast and I had to completely rethink it (and myself). Once the beautiful and sometimes terrible visuals had subsided I went and sat on the floor in front of my work to explore it and see what I could make of it in that altered state. 

At some point I looked up at the bunny cast I linked above and suddenly his face became filled with life. It didn‚Äôt change much or move, some faint blue and pink light appeared, illuminating it from beneath and it was filled with significance like some ancient god of the Maya. When I first sculpted it I put all the love and warmth I could into his face and at that moment he started beaming it into my heart - I could feel it physically in my chest. All I could do was stare at him appreciatively and bask in the warmth. I was listening to Enya that night and it started when [this short song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIfC4q5LlKA) came on. At 0:27 the vocals take on an especially otherworldly character and since the speakers were behind the cast it felt like his breath and life flowing through from some other dimension. There was a powerful feeling that it was an actual being, alive but not the thing itself, an avatar of it that allowed it to come through. I also had a strong sense that he was one of many, that there were other similar beings stretching out into infinity to either side and behind him. [This is the best](https://i.imgur.com/R91CLfR.jpg) I could do to convey it, though the versions to either side were felt rather than seen.

I‚Äôve no idea how long I sat looking at him. I do remember afterwards I lay on my back staring at the ceiling, wide-eyed and smiling. I said out loud this PROVES there is a spiritual dimension to human existence. I later had to admit it does not prove the entities themselves are real. I was pretty convinced at the time, but the experience was so profoundly moving, so deeply felt that I have no words for it other than a spiritual encounter. The experience itself was *very* real. I'm sure this won't come as a surprise to you experienced travellers but for me it was a revelation.

I‚Äôve since made maybe a dozen clay models about it (all still works in progress) and have a lot more to do. I‚Äôm hoping in a month or two I‚Äôll be able to go back, this time with 300ug, and see where it takes me.",114,5198,21,965,1

2022-07-30 02:01:16,Watched my friend go into a complete state of mania on 5g of mushrooms. He was reliving past trauma and screaming for hours.,"(trigger warning, sexual assault)  

My roommate (who I'll call Jon,) ate 5g of ghost and albino mushrooms last night. I was at work when he dropped, and he was peaking by the time I got home. All I heard when I walked up to the house was screaming- I thought there was a bad argument going on. Another roommate was on the porch and told me what had happened. I knew I had to help my other roommates calm him down. I went to his unit, and he was on the ground, screaming and writhing, yelling ""Reality is real! Science is real! We're all gods! I have trauma! I have so much trauma!"" over and over and over again. He kicked me in the crotch twice by accident before wrapping his arms around my waist in a hug and burying his head in my crotch as he clung to my pants and almost pulled them down. I just rested my hand on his shoulder and told him it'd be alright.  

We had to shush him once every 10 seconds because he kept screaming about science and reality. Eventually we tried to walk him to his room and get him to bed. He was completely limp and couldn't walk unaided. At this point, he's completely separate from reality. We sat him on the bed and stayed with him. He asked me if he could kiss me, and I told him ""no"" and that I wasn't gay (didn't know he was before last night.) A few minutes later he lunged out of bed at me, grabbed my head, and went in for a kiss. I turned my head and said ""no"" again, and he sat back on the bed, wild-eyed, and apologized. A few minutes later he asked for a kiss again, and I refused, again.  

Jon sat up, crying, and in the worst thought loop I can possibly imagine. He kept repeating ""My brother raped me. He stuck his penis inside of me."" I didn't know what to do or say- my eyes began to well up and I felt the sheer scope of how unqualified I was to deal with this situation. All I could do is say ""it's okay"" and ""you're here now,"" and give him a reassuring hand on the shoulder as I played calming music.  

I got Jon a glass of water. He was laying on his back, and when I handed him the glass, he kept laying down as he poured the water on his face, and then set the glass down sideways on his bed, spilling the remaining water on the sheets. He got more and more disconnected from reality, so we decided to draw him a bath to help him calm down. We turned the water on, got him a towel and clean clothes, and led him into the bathroom. We told him to get undressed and get into the tub, and he complied. We shut the door and waited outside the bathroom, but we realized he probably wouldn't know how to shut the water off once the tub filled. We went back in the bathroom to pull the plug from the drain and turn the shower on, and Jon was naked on the floor with the lights off. We turned the shower on and left him again, and at this point he was finally responding when we talked to him. Once he was in the shower, we went outside to take a breather.  

A few minutes later, Jon opened the door and walked outside, totally naked. We told him to get inside and put clothes on. Jon's solution was not to put clothes on, but to stick his head out the door so as not to reveal his naked body to the whole block. After the third time of telling him to put clothes on, he walked outside in pants, asking if he'd die if he went to bed. We assured him he wouldn't, and he finally went to bed for the night.  

This morning, we were all worried about how Jon was doing. He messaged the group chat, saying ""it's not easy to exist some days, but this helped cope. Reality is realer than ever, and I am humbled."" We sat on the porch and talked for an hour, and he seemed at peace. I'm glad he got a good experience in the end, but this is a reminder to not fuck around with a high dose of mushrooms unless you're prepared to go through what Jon went through.",124,3806,23,757,1

2021-06-18 07:16:45,I went to hell,"About ten years ago I made a list of things I was going to do before I killed myself, and one of those things was to take a shitload of shrooms and hope that I woke up a fundamentally different person. I didn't care who I woke up as, as long as that person wasn't me anymore. At this point in my life the hardest drug I'd ever done was a single hit of weed and a couple shots. I did it in a pitch-dark room in an empty house late at night, because I'd read that bad trips cause larger permanent personality changes than good trips.

It felt, at first, like I was coming apart. Like my self was not something whole and concrete, it was just a bunch of puzzle pieces. The shrooms took that puzzle apart, took me apart. I remember then the shattered fragments of my self falling down an infinitely deep well. I remember looking up and seeing a light, and that light vanishing, until nothing remained but the hell I found myself in. 

It was a blackness, an infinite screaming darkness of madness and chaos. I tried to cling to myself in that place and it crushed me to nothing and drowned me in that infinite black pain. The only thought in my head was the realization that I was broken into an infinite number of pieces and would never be whole again. It is a thing beyond words.

I've read that people with trauma can remember the time and place where the trauma happened and I can confirm this is true, because it's been ten years but when I close my eyes I can see the room where this happened more clearly than I see the room in front of me. Like it happened yesterday, and time means nothing. I spent about a half hour curled up in a fetal position rocking back and forth, reliving the experience over and over and over again. Each time I did this, it felt like I was driving a knife into my flesh, into my soul, and carving the pain I had felt into me because that was what the pain told me to do. Eventually the benzo's kicked in and I was able to re-assemble the shattered fragments of my self and continue on in my life. 

For a very long time I didn't know what to do with this experience. It was like being hit by a bus; there's no reason for it, no purpose, it's just pointless suffering. I remember even then that I felt no regret for what I had experienced. I wanted this, I chose this, I bought the ticket and I took the ride. It's different when the only person you're hurting is yourself. When I touch these memories with my mind I feel no pain, only the bone-deep scar tissue that I carved into my soul that will be with me forever.

I had a different experience later, this one caused by a mixture of piracetam and psychosis from stress and lack of sleep. I was walking along the beach, one foot on the shore and the other in the ocean, and I remember that I felt whole, complete, like I was the bridge between the infinite mystery of the ocean and the whole of the world. I remember thinking how beatiful it was to be alive, to experience this moment, this boundless joy and love that I felt in the simple act of existing. I was whole, I was at peace, and all was right in the world, everything was perfect the way it was, I was perfect the way I was. 

For a long time I wasn't able to understand these experiences. There was a peace in knowing I had already experienced what were likely the best and worst days of my life, that I could never feel anything worse than hell or better than that moment by the sea, but the lesson felt incomplete. 

It took a long time, but I finally realized that the lesson was to love. In my visit to hell I tried and failed to cling to my ego and felt only pain. And when I walked by the sea my ego fell away and I felt only pure joy. These experiences were not the insane delusions of my broken and drug-addled mind, these were lessons of the choices I can make and the lives I can live and the two people I can become. To set aside my ego and in the doing become lost in the pure love of the world around me, or to cling to my ego and suffer that infinite fear and agony. It doesn't matter if death is the end or not, if god is real or just a delusion. None of these things change the things I felt, nor do they change the person I want to become.

2021-01-02 17:07:54,You can‚Äôt ‚Äúkill‚Äù your ego.,"I think a lot of people misconstrue the concept of ‚Äúego death‚Äù. It‚Äôs not about removing or deleting your ego, it‚Äôs about cleansing it. Your ego is an essential part of your psyche, through it you create your persona. It‚Äôs good to experience ‚Äúego death‚Äù but you need to be sure to rebuild it stronger than before. Psychedelics are a great means by which to cleans your ego but you must spend time whilst sober working on and moulding it into shape. Your ego is where your self confidence comes from, the main problem with the ego is that it simply accumulates ideologies and beliefs based upon what you experience or learn via other people‚Äôs beliefs and teachings. We must try to rebuild it in a way that it becomes the most constructive and beautiful part of us. I think this experience should be renamed to ‚Äúego rebirth‚Äù or ‚Äúego cleansing‚Äù.

During this same trip, I then started thinking about my girlfriend, and how she said she didn't like my use of these psychedelics, and then I started feeling guilty, anxious, and my trip went a bit rotten. I got quite overwhelmed.

I really have tried hard to explain my use of them as a positive thing. I am learning, I am exploring, and I am finding gratitude in my life. But she just can't get behind it because of the way she was raised. She isn't threatening to break up with me or anything, and I have never lied about them, I just don't enjoy the energy that she gives me around them. She says ""What did you do all day? Cause it sounds like you just woke up and did dRuGs"". I need a cool, calming force, rather than judgement coming from the person closest to me.

How can I go about either bringing her closer to this understanding or how can I move past the judgement and finding calmness during my future trips? It is not a good feeling to be deep in a shrooms trip and then think ""I should not have done this"".

Edit: thank you for my first ever awards. I am new to this community and i appreciate all of your words. I will not be leaving my girlfriend, like many have suggested, but I have talked to her get sternly about why I don't just want her to be okay with my use of psychedelics, I want her to SUPPORT it. I want her to love it. She's looking into research on the subject, watching videos from John Hopkins and we are planning on watching one of the documentaries recommended by y'all.

Her first time tripping was at Electric Forest. Our whole relationship, we have responsibly enjoyed various mind altering substances, mostly LSD and MDMA. Those are some of my fondest memories of our relationship. For our honeymoon we were at a resort up in the woods and took L and stayed up all night tripping, laughing, making love.

Rolling with her is my absolute favorite thing in the world. She truly is my everything and I felt so lucky to be able to experience that wonderful drug with her. We space it out 3 months and always have an amazing time.

2 weeks ago she told me that she wasn‚Äôt attracted to me anymore and it fucking hurts. We are talking about separation and divorce and it makes me sick to my stomach. I think of all the things that I will miss and our psychonaut experiences is going to be one of the hardest to come to terms with.

The thought of not having her there for future trips or rolls fills me with the worst feeling. I hope to be able to enjoy them again someday but quite honestly I don‚Äôt know if I can bring myself to it. Too many intense emotional memories are attached.

2019-02-21 21:53:23,Heroic Doses,"As many of you know, I‚Äôve been doing psychedelics for over 50 years.  About 20 years ago I read Terrance McKenna‚Äôs books on his adventures with the mushroom. At the time I was using street lsd and was very unhappy with the quality; being my son was my dealer he suggested shrooms.  Over the next year I became his best customer. 

TM first coined the ‚Äòheroic dose‚Äô, 5 grams taken in the dark in silence. It was so sweet.  I then read from him of what he called the ‚Äòmushroom fast‚Äô.  He said to start with 5 grams and increase it one gram each time, taken every four days.  I maxed out at 25 grams as by the time I ate that much I was too stoned to eat anymore. I kept it at 25 grams for the next year, continuing at that level, every four days. Being I was in a federal pre-trial (for a few financial crimes - don‚Äôt ask) I couldn‚Äôt use alcohol or pot, just shrooms. UAs couldn‚Äôt detect shrooms. 

Just about every trip started with me in a large cave, rising several hundred feet up.  There were hundreds of doors open with the little mushroom people singing to me, saying ‚Äúcome with me.‚Äù  I would select one and go with them, while they were talking in a strange psychedelic language that I learn to understand and speak.  They would take me to other dimensions to visit strange worlds and even stranger creatures. 

One night I mixed gotu kola with it and really liked the effect, so the next time I took a huge dose of gotu kola and it was terrible. I was hanging out my apartment window screaming that this bitch of a plant was trying to kill me.  The next two times I ate shrooms nothing happened. The third time, when it was coming on, I realized I offended the Mushroom and I kept telling her how sorry I was.  This gigantic creature appeared over me, crying tears of liquid mercury onto me, and in broken English said ‚Äúshe is my friend, this is your last chance.‚Äù

I spent 2.5 years in prison and one my first day after I got out I bought 5 grams. That night I returned to the cave and all of the little mushroom people were dancing around me, singing and they asked me where have I been?  I told them I had been in prison and just got out.  There reaction was ‚Äòyou should have told us, we could have visited you in the night.  We thought you were mad at us.‚Äô

I don‚Äôt like the term heroic dose, as young people may think of it as an ego thing.  Many jump in at the really high doses and have a bad trip.  I‚Äôve learn to go slowly, adding a little at a time.  If I do too large of a dose I can‚Äôt remember anything as the trip is just too strange.  With chemicals it easy to get too much.

2019-09-05 13:19:20,I feel like I want to quit my job after trying shrooms and LSD,"I have been a software developer (in the Netherlands) with a good income for over the past 10 years. I've been meditating for a long time but started doing it daily for the last two years. I'm interested in psychedelics since I was 18 years old, but at that time I was too afraid to try it because I was too depressed with my life.

A few months ago I met a girl who had experience with shrooms and I asked her to trip sit me for my first psychedelic experience. I found the trip very hard and at moments quite frightening. But this trip was nothing less than life changing for me, because it confronted me with the things in life I could do better. I decided to spend my time differently. For example, I quit my smartphone addiction. Furthermore, I sold my playstation, my television and a bunch of other stuff I no longer valued in my life and I bought lots of plants. Since then I'm really enjoying taking care of the plants and taking cuttings of them and so on.

Last weekend I tried LSD for the first time at a psytrance festival. It was one great adventure, hardly scary at all. It really felt like coming home and I felt truly connected with nature and all forms of life. Afterwards I had a great feeling of satisfaction and joy. I don't think I ever felt this mindful. But there is one problem. I'm not interested in my work anymore. I feel like quitting my job to get rid of all those technical difficulties so I can live a meaningful and simple life. I want to live more outside instead of behind a computer all the time. I feel like selling my house and moving outside the big city.

But all those things I feel like doing really scare me as well. It feels like giving up certainties and wealth, although I realise that true wealth isn't earned with possessions. Any else went through these kind of life changes? Any advice on the steps to move forward?

Will just say I love going deep. All I ever wanted to know was what was beyond this illusion we live through day in and day out. My last trip was with 7-8g mushrooms. This time, however, was the first time I needed to ground myself and desperately clung to anything familiar. 

I laid in bed, listening to NPR on my phone while keeping one hand on each of my sleeping cats. Their usual indifference to my affairs was exactly what I needed to experience. Strangely enough, the usual melodramatic news cycle also helped me stay grounded.

I saw all the usual visuals and experienced the usual realms but the purpose of this trip was to re calibrate how I move through this world. I want to change my energy so I can change my environment and my interactions with those around me.  Then, perhaps, I will change my outcomes.

2021-06-06 14:07:15,The measures I take to avoid a bad trip,"I follow these points.

* I get in phases when weed can cause anxiety. Such phases happen and last months. No psychedelics if I am in such a phase.
* I don't read bad trip reports. In most such reports you can clearly notice some irresponsibility on the part of the tripper. Also, people with bad experiences tend to share their experience more often than those with extremely good experiences. This is because people who had bad trips want to keep others safe, which is an appreciable intention but it spreads fear, which can lead to bad trips.
* I mentally start preparing a few weeks before my trip. I tell myself that I am going to do this for my general well being. I remind myself that this is like any medical treatment, which can be painful, but we still go through it because we know the long term benefits will exceed any discomfort. Also I start to refine my very carefully selected new-age and classical instrumental music playlist.
* 10 days before the trip, I make sure I am regular with my daily runs, bi-weekly hikes in the forest near my home and my twice a day 30 minute meditation sessions.
* 3 days before trip I stop drinking coffee and any thing with any stimulant affects. Stimulants can trigger anxiety during a trip, so I want my body fully clean by my trip.
* Day before the trip I go for a 3 hour hike and scan my feelings. If anything is not right, even if it is a minor headache or bad mood, the trip is postponed.
* On the day of trip I fast. It is very important that I go toilet in the morning so my stomach and bowl is empty. I go for a run. This brings cortisol (fear hormone) levels in the body down. Then I take a warm bath without adding any bath salts, clip my nails, shave my pubes and armpits. This gives me a feeling of freshness and cleanliness, and makes me feel good. Then I meditate for 30-45 minutes.
* Final self scan before taking medicine. If anything, no matter how minor, does not feel good, the mission is aborted.
* By now I have completely prepared myself for anything. My expectations are humble. I'll take and accept whatever mushroom decides for me. No matter if it is a very real feeling of death, hell or heaven, I'll accept it. I give myself to mushroom and surrender no matter what.
* Just before ingestion. Now my wife, the best trip sitter in the world is in charge. She has put her therapists hat on. She is there to make sure I am safe, she has trip killer on hand, although she knows that she will not give me unless things are really bad. Phones in the home are on no disturb mode. She leaves me alone and stays in the next room and instantly available if I need water or just want to hold her hand and cry, which happens on large (5g+) doses.
* I take my dose, put headphones on, blindfolds on and just go in a meditative state of mind and hand myself to mushrooms. Mushrooms never disappoint me.

I never had a bad trip. I don't claim that the measures I take completely eliminate chances of a rough trip, but these manures definetely reduce chances of a bad trip significantly.

I had read the research. I myself have ptsd and depression. I know that others have had success using mushrooms as a therapeutic tool. 

Let me say I have only ever done weed before. I am a regular user of cannabis but thats it. No booze for 9 years. 

I have also been doing CBT/DBT and EMDR over the last three years. I am also prescribed 250 mg bupropion. I have worked very hard at my recovery and I have lots of tools in my toolbox to work through emotions.

Will let me just say 7g of blue meanies was just what I needed.

I had my loving wife as a guide. I spent at least 3 hours in the bathtub just feeling my emotions and allowing them in.

I accepted the pain and hurt that is within me. All the bad stuff that's happened to me, it's ok. I don't have to be afraid anymore. All that hurt is a part of me, and it always will be. That's ok. It's who I am.

Running from the hurt, locking the hurt into a box like I did my entire life was really limiting my growth and recovery. Thing is, I had no idea I was doing that until last night.

I felt like I had access to this previously untapped well of raw emotion. I felt raw pain and hurt. I also felt love in its most raw form. It isn't that I can't find the words to describe the feeling, it's that the feeling is undefinable. 

I saw the past and how it effects me today. I saw that I have the ability, within my self, to change the way I think and travel through this existence.

2023-04-06 22:20:36,"Tripping in the Bronze Age A new study based on strands of hair found in a Spanish burial cave reveals that humans living about 3,000 years ago used hallucinogens, likely derived from local plants, as part of their rituals.","Bronze Age humans have been credited with a number of civilizational advancements: the invention of irrigation, the wheel, writing systems and the ability to forge weapons and tools from the durable metal that lends the era its name.

Now, strands of human hair discovered in an ancient burial cave in Spain suggest another novelty: a proclivity for consuming psychoactive drugs.

The hair, found inside wooden containers hidden deep within a sealed grotto on Minorca, an island off the coast of eastern Spain, tested positive for a number of mind-altering compounds, suggesting that the people who lived there 3,000 years ago incorporated hallucinogenic experiences into the rituals of their lives.

The findings, published Thursday in Scientific Reports of the journal Nature, provide the first direct evidence that ancient Europeans consumed psychoactive drugs much like their pre-Columbian brethren in Mesoamerica, the researchers said.

Elisa Guerra-Doce, the lead author of the study, said researchers were stunned by the results, especially because the cave interiors yielded no detectable signs of the drugs‚Äô presence. A chemical analysis of the hair revealed evidence of three alkaloid substances known to produce altered states of consciousness: ephedrine, atropine and scopolamine.

The compounds themselves are produced by flora native to Minorca. Atropine and scopolamine, powerful hallucinogens, can be found in plants in the nightshade family, among them mandrake, henbane and thorn apple. Ephedrine, a stimulant, can be extracted from joint pine.

‚ÄúThese findings are so singular,‚Äù said Ms. Guerra-Doce, an expert in the anthropology of intoxication at the University of Valladolid in Spain. ‚ÄúSometimes when people think about drugs, they think it‚Äôs a modern practice. These results tell a different story.‚Äù

Ms. Guerra-Doce said the way the compounds were distributed through each hair strand suggests the drugs were consumed over the period of a year, and well before death.

The cave, Es C√†rritx, was discovered by spelunkers in 1995 and held the remains of more than 200 people who had been laid to rest over the course of six centuries, with the latest burial in roughly 800 B.C.E. Many were related across multiple generations. Curiously, the cave did not contain the bodies of pregnant women or babies.
For anthropologists, the cave‚Äôs most significant treasure were the tubular boxes, mostly wooden but some made of antler, that held tufts of hair dyed red. The boxes and their contents survived in large part because the cave‚Äôs opening, more than 80 feet beneath the upper ledge of a 300-foot-tall gorge, had been sealed off by rubble that had collapsed long ago.

Although there is no way to know why these ancient people were consuming such powerful drugs, Ms. Guerra-Doce noted that the boxes featured patterns that present-day humans might interpret as psychedelic inspired ‚Äî a series of concentric circles suggesting the hypnotic bull‚Äôs-eye drawings of yore.

Ancient humans are thought to have used drug plants for both medicinal purposes and religious ceremonies, but until now, much of the scholarship has been based on indirect evidence such as pottery vessels, smoking pipes or plant residue from opium poppies or cannabis found at archaeological sites across Eurasia.

Giorgio Samorini, an Italian ethnobotanist who specializes in the archaeology of psychoactive plants and who was not involved in the study, said he was exhilarated by the findings. He said they added to a growing body of evidence suggesting that hallucinogens were an integral part of ancient societies worldwide.
He said the context of the findings suggested the drugs were consumed as part of a religious ritual. ‚ÄúThis was not a profane purpose of ‚Äòsearching for a high‚Äô but more generally the search for existential meaning that has been largely lost to time,‚Äù he said in an email.

Because the strands lacked hair bulbs, scientists were unable to do a DNA analysis that would allow them to determine the sex of those who had consumed the compounds.

The three compounds have a long history of human use. Ephedrine is a stimulant that provides bursts of energy and mental clarity, and it can stave off sleepiness. Atropine and scopolamine are powerful deliriants that can produce hallucinations and out-of-body experiences. In higher concentrations, atropine can lead to respiratory failure, paralysis and death.

Although impossible to know for sure, Ms. Guerra-Doce said the presence of these drugs suggested that the people who used them were guided by someone, perhaps a shaman, who understood their powers. ‚ÄúThere is so much more we need to learn,‚Äù she said.",223,4670,39,736,1
2021-03-20 21:54:01,Dmt changed me,"Experienced with the Big 3 psychedelics, lots of fun trips, good times, scary times, but Nothing compares to DMT

DMT changed me.

A few years ago I had convinced myself that I wanted to try DMT. I wanted to see what this experience was about. Were there really aliens? Is there a different dimension? At the very least I could get to try something new.

I had heard Rogan talk about it. I know ‚ÄúJoe rogan‚Äù he can be full of shit sometimes but I‚Äôve taken some tidbits of advice from him. Also Hamilton Morris, his work is phenomenal.

So began the search for some DMT. An easy Google search will help you find anything ‚ÄúHoW tOO mAKe DMt‚Äù found the ingredients Mimosa Hostilis Root Bark, vinegar, pickling lime, and some ronsonol (this evaporates). gordo tek is a cool thing to Google. After some easy bake type shenanigans Bang, I had my own home made dmt. 

I start to experiment. I‚Äôm seeing cool colours, fingers are long, the walls change a bit, mild shrooms type visuals when I mix it with weed (sandwich method). 

That‚Äôs cool, but where‚Äôs the space travel? I look into better vaporization methods I get a small glass pipe, just a metal screen and weed bowl. this takes me to a new world. I can‚Äôt really see my physical surroundings, I can see shapes of colours coming towards me, geometric patterns, it‚Äôs the most visuals I‚Äôve ever experienced from a substance. I feel the presence of a female, it‚Äôs friendly, it‚Äôs developing In shapes in front of me. It‚Äôs very motherly, I feel love.‚Äù This stuff is cool‚Äù I realized the more pure dmt I could inhale the better I could travel. I knew there was more to see, it was like it was teasing me, enticing me in. Like it wanted me to come closer to it.

After some trial and error with different smoking methods, I found the best way. A wax pen with a ceramic donut works best, a Yocan with a donut works great if you need something easy to Google. 

I was entering strange worlds. I could leave my physical existence here. I got to a point where I would forget what had happened, I would forget I smoked, I would forget who I was. I was a stoned ape, couldn‚Äôt even think of words. I felt time go past me, past present and future all at once, this was my space travel I wanted, crazy visuals, I can‚Äôt even describe them, imagine windows music player visualizer. Great times, but I felt I was abusing this substance. I didn‚Äôt feel the calling for it but did it anyways. 

This would result in a terrible experience. I felt that I had DIED.

I measure out my powder, about 50 mg. I melt it bit by bit on the donut coil by pulsing the battery, just one second bursts so the powder turns to an oil. I get ready I breathe, I think of Alan watts type shit, I meditate I get ready to leave this planet. Press the battery, inhale for 10, hold for 5, exhale. Inhale for 10, hold for 5 exhale, on the third set I finally broke through, every part of me was shattered, very quickly everything around me sped up, ultimate fear ripped through me, this was not a fun experience, my spine tingles as I write this thinking of it. The room I was in went to a very light blue everhy object was cartoony. I felt like a comet smashed outside my house, I was dead, the world had ended

My body was already a corpse already. Once dead I was a small portion of humanity, a mass that has become lifeless. The existence of my life had ceased. Those who have not experienced this cannot conceive what it‚Äôs like to have their reality ripped apart by the threads. I don‚Äôt know what it was that had spoke to me, it‚Äôs not even like it spoke it transmitted thoughts to me, ultimate delirium. ‚ÄúYoure fucked you‚Äôre fucked your fucked, you wanted to fuck around here you are‚Äù this being wanted me gone, I felt nothing but fear and malice, this was not like the fun experiences before, I had fallen out of existence and time. I can‚Äôt put into words the experience, just that it was fucked, I was fucked. I came to and was at baseline about 30 minutes later. 

I read ‚Äúman‚Äôs search for meaning‚Äù Viktor e Frankl. He was a Holocaust and death camp survivor. His experience is beautiful to hear. 

‚ÄúI saw the truth as so claimed by so many poets and musicians proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth that love is the hugest goal man can aspire. The salvation of man was through love and in love.‚Äù

Viktor E Frankl

Long story short I died. I felt like I had died. I wanted life, I missed my girlfriend, my mom, my sister, my boss, my niece, nephews, I missed my friends, enemies. I missed physical reality. I wanted to be back here with everyone I wanted and needed to feel LOVE.


I needed to feel love. Once I was back I needed love. This substance changed me. I am a better person to everyone because I experienced this pseudo death. This life is short, finite.  being bitter and shitty is a waste of precious energy. LOVE IS AS STRONG AS DEATH. 

It‚Äôs made me super interested in science, philosophy, and just physical reality in general. It‚Äôs re wired my brain for the better. I love to learn, I focus on what‚Äôs going to help me, reading, writing, useless ukuleles. I feel so much less anxiety, I focus my energy on truth, I focus on myself, my relationships, every person I encounter I try to treat it as if this may be the last time we ever see one another.

2023-04-22 11:10:08,"The longer I am aware of the psychedelic community, the more I see how deluded people can be and how people can falsely convinced themselves that psychedelics solved their problems","I've had quite some intense experimentation with psychedelics in the past and I've been around the 'community' for a while. First actively meeting up with people around me that were interested in psychedelics too and later on more passively reading what people are sharing. 

Before my experimentation I was sceptic, but after getting into it I was mind blown like many others. In combination with the studying of various spiritual philosophies I started to make myself believe things I heard people say and thought I had been shown in my experiences. I guess I'd call this my psychedelic/spiritual phase where you're making yourself believe you have acquired insight that solves your life problems. Fortunately it lasted quite shortly.

I started seeing this behavior a lot within the psychedelic community and it keeps diminishing the value that I have put on psychedelics. Everyone seems to know the absolute truth and try to tell and teach others how things are. People have this huge clot of far out beliefs that are super inconsistent and fall apart like a card house. I wish I would see more people staying humble and just acknowledging that they don't know.   
Also I think people start rambling too quickly about what insights they believe they have acquired because I'm sure a year after the experience they see that they are left with empty hands.

I think it's difficult to describe and put to words the behavior that I am seeing, but a super extreme example of this is Leo Gura. He is so extremely deluded and lost on these psychedelic drugs and is convinced he had millions of 'awakenings' with all the far out convincements around it. It really shows that psychedelics and spiritual seeking can be a very dangerous combination.

For me the most painful are these posts on Reddit where people have overdone psychedelics and are so obviously going through psychotic episodes where they see all kinds of entities in their sober life and suffer from paranoia and other hallucinations and then the whole comment section is encouraging the person to keep pushing and take more psychedelics because that will bring the person to the realisation that they are. Telling people with a psychotic episode: 'It's just your demons. It is just your resistance, let go of it. The problem is that you haven't pushed until the ego death phase because if you had a real authentic ego death you would have seen you're one with everything.' And throwing their other wacky beliefs to a person who obviously needs serious treatment. 

It might just seem to me like a big part of the people who take psychedelics are like this because they are the ones who talk and post most and the people who sincerely got something good out of it just don't have the desire to throw that to people. Psychedelics are a wonderful thing and I still like to experience the expansion now and then, but the 'miracle substance' image I had of it is starting wear off.",180,2938,30,505,1

2022-02-05 01:11:41,Just a friendly reminder to not follow any cults.,"Hi everybody,
Recently I have found this guy Leo Gura from youtube channel Actualized.org with over 1 million subscribers. 

I was shocked to be honest, first it starts with classic quantum mysticism and misrepresentation of science. I am not cool with these things as I respect science and hate when liars use it to make milions of dollars, but this guy got to another level. 

Later on he basically tells the viewer to take psychedelics to seek and find the truth and to not be lost forever. Obviously manipulating people into taking drugs is not ok and as long as I would love if everybody would have at least one psychedelic experience so it won't be that of a taboo, you can't force or manipulate people into doing so. 

However, as I thought that it can't get any worst, this guy in multiple videos tells the viewer to basically kill yourself as it's the only way to save yourself. He tells the viewer that HE IS THE GOD, but he had to scale down on our monkey level to communicate with us.

This is very dangerous person, we are very real, don't het manipulated by any frauds that tells you otherwise. Particles are real and so are we. Do not harm yourself in any way just because some person tells you to do so. Don't do psychedelics if you are mentally unstable person or have any mental illness, it is DANGEROUS. 

Our community is full of love so don't let these kind of people make it any different.

2021-04-11 10:14:02,Trip report: 5g 'heroic dose' in silent darkness,"Hey all, wanted to share my trip report for my first heroic dose  - 5g dried burma cubensis mushrooms in silent darkness.

So i live alone, i was in a great mood, been doing a ton of spiritual healing these past months, i meditate every day, eat vegan, exercise, cold showers, spending most of my time alone, mostly been totally sober for 4 months now. I've also taken psychedelics a lot, but the highest mushroom trip I did before this was 3.5g alone in a forest.

My intention for this trip was to gain even greater self-acceptance. I wrote a note to myself to read on the comeup when you start to get very anxious and listened to music the first 20 mins. Then it hit me - music off and eyes blindfolded.

I was transported to this other dimension of patterns, space and time didn't make sense or exist here. Impossible to describe it. I met a highly sexual and seductive woman spirit who beckoned me to have sex with her, she did not look like a woman at all, I could just sense a spirit, so hard to explain. I began to make love to her and then suddenly she stopped, just when i became vulnerable with her and surrendered, she took it all away.

Then came the teachings. The mushrooms gave me the harshest critiques I can imagine. That my entire life was controlled by my fear of loss ( My dad died when I was 7). They harshly told me for what felt like eternities about every single area of my life was being controlled by my fear of loss - overthinking, rumination, people-pleasing, staying in relationships too long. I got caught in a loop with them - I accepted what they were saying but couldn't be free from it and it felt never-ending.

I felt an overwhelming urge to vomit (stupidly ate the mushrooms and did not lemon tek), but I could barely move - opening my eyes I was existing in a world of cubes and patterns that vaguely resembled my room but that were separate, unending cubes and fractals without space or dimension. I was totally disconnected to myself but also a part of everything. Somehow i managed to stand up and remember I am a fighter. I purged my ego and then, staring into the toilet, I finally surrendered my ego. I was taken to a different realm with no space, time, boundaries, identities - pure bliss and also terrifying. Language was gone and incomprehensible.

I managed somehow to get back to my bed, and I had an unending orgasm, the most utter, ecstatic pleasure imaginable for centuries, lifetimes, I was the universe. Then at some point I became scared again, worried I would never be able to come back from this place. I crawled to the bathroom. I puked, I deficated myself - i was totally powerless in the face of this knowledge/being/experience. Somehow I managed to make it back to my bad but the anxiety was overwhelming. My ego was pulling me back again and eventually, after 5 hours, I decided to take a xanax.

I am so thankful for this experience and I definitely want to do these shamanic doses again but jesus christ - be prepared for total annihilation of your ego and all sense of this thing we call 'reality'.

2022-08-31 18:35:50,"If a God exists, basic math proves he/it is everywhere."," **If** a single all powerful God exists, then by using the mathematical concept of Factors, one can easily prove that he exists within all. And its pretty simple. Let me explain:

0 = nothing. This we should all easily be able to agree upon. If you have five apples and someone takes five apples away from you, you have no apples.

1 = God. ""God is above all, "" ""God is the **Alpha** and the omega,"" ""God come's first,"" I could go on, but the idea is many religions relate God with the number 1

Any other number does not need definition for there are infinite numbers and infinite aspects of the universe. If you wanted to you could attempt to map out the relations but, that would take infinitely long time. Through out history we have defined some of these numbers though, such as Pi.

Now I'll give you some math examples of Factors:

Factors of 36 : **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36**

Factors of 948: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 79, 158, 237, 316, 474, 948**

Factors of 7: **1, 7**

Factors of 7537: **1, 7537**

No matter what number or ""aspect of the universe"" they **all** have one thing in common. **They can all be composed by multiplying itself with God.**",55,1165,10,220,1

god is real. god is love. god is morals. god is manners. god is fun. god is care. god is a teacher, god has been with you your whole life, he lets you struggle because he gave you the superpower of free will. god is dope. trust god, it will give you the power to over come any challenge if you just have trust in the process, he won't punish you for struggling, no amount of struggle will make you get punished as long as you accept god when he shows you the way. god is cool, god doesn't care if you use drugs just use clean drugs that come from the earth or has been synthesized through ingredients from the earth. take responsibility for your actions, have morals, but most of all have fun. talk to your neighbor and let the ray of god flow through you don't let's the negative energy take over (the devil aka shiva) find balance between the two. find your spiritual balance through energetic yin yang.

In the story of Adam and Eve, both of them ate the apple from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, then they becomes self-aware. Our ego(sense of self), makes us identify ourselves, thus we link our image to external things such as body and clothes, same with what‚Äôs happening to Adam and Eve when they put on leaves on their bodies. Besides, Only if we have ego we can identify good and evil because it is related to ourselves. Also, ego is what makes us human, same as Adam and Eve after being banished from Garden of Eden. So it kinda makes sense relating ego to The forbidden fruit right ?

And if Forbidden fruit is our Ego, People in the Garden of Eden would be the souls/ consciousness (as I assume pure consciousness have no ego) and the garden would be heaven or world of collective consciousness, where people/ conscious beings are living peacefully and in harmony as they have absolutely no ego.

2022-08-02 12:12:25,"The problem with psychedelics as ""treatment""","TL;DR, Psychedelics aren't medicine, and using them as treatment is missing the point. 

&#x200B;

There's a cultural narrative around psychedelics and their potential to help with with things like trauma, PTSD, anxiety, depression, OCD, etc... you know the script. The narrative has been around since the Nixon era, but it has recently taken a larger stage with social media, Netflix, YouTube, etc..

I'm gonna try and be concise and not ramble on...

\- psychedelics can indeed help with the ailments listed above, but there is a much bigger event taking place that isn't being talked about within the social narrative. 

\- relief from these ailments is just a byproduct of ""what's actually happening"" when you take pyches. 

So what's actually happening? (trying to keep it short and sweet)

\- I would argue that, in short, psychedelics challenge (and even destroy) the hubris of Individualism. They challenge our definition of what it means to be alone. They create a paradigm shift within our values and concepts. They bestow ""ancient knowledge"" to the user; the knowledge that there is nothing to know. As TK said (as well as most scientists and mathematicians), ""Knowledge is provisional."" Concepts and ideas are mere models of reality, not true representations. 

So to call psychedelics ""medicine"" seems off the mark. Yes, they have therapeutic effects, the same as reading a good book, meditating, spending time with loved ones, laughter, exercising, forming healthy routines etc... but we don't see people trying to push these activities as ""treatment"" or ""medicine"". 

Psychedelics need to be legalized and unregulated, but that's not gonna happen... There's obviously a lot of money to be made, and using psyches as ""treatment"" is the most profitable path. Pharmaceutical companies are gonna make a lot of money in the future off of psychedelics, and in doing so, the ancient knowledge is going to be silenced.

2019-12-09 10:09:18,"Stop believing the ego is your friend, every single thing that comes out of it is PURE LIES"," 

""I am in a much better place now"" that is your ego saying ""I was once like this, now I am like this""""I want to be better"" is your ego.

""I want to be mentally stronger"" is your ego.

""I know this comes with experience and time"" is your ego.

""I would like suggestions on how I can train my mind"" is your ego.

""how I can connect with the universe"" is your ego.

""I don't want to live my life anxiously and in fear"" is your ego.

""I would like to live a more calm, peaceful life"" is your ego.

The first step and last step is to be aware of being aware of ego.

The ego always wants things to be better, it wants to improve, it was to be stronger, it likes experience and it likes time, it wants to train, it wants to connect, it doesn't want anxiety and fear, it wants calm and peacefulness.

Now, the ego is not your friend, so do not trust all of these thoughts that it is producing, they are already backfiring. How?

Because you believe you want to be better, you are saying you are not good enough.

Because you know becoming better is with experience and time, it means you inevitably have to suffer until it passes.

Because you believe you need to train your mind, you are saying your mind is incomplete.

Because you believe you want to connect with the universe, you are saying you are disconnected.

Now this is an especially funny one, how can you be disconnected from the universe if you are literally the manifestation of the universe? you are literally one with the universe at all times, unless you don't even exist.

Because you believe you want to live your life with no anxiety and fear, you are saying your life is filled with anxiety and fear.

Because you believe you want a calmer and peaceful life, it means life is not calm nor peaceful now.

The truth is, these are all complete bullshit lies and there is absolutely no importance you should give these things.

The ego will haunt you till the die your body dies, and then you will realize ""I just want to exist, I do not want to die!""So you better kill it now before the ego eats your whole life away.

Realize that you are merely observing these thoughts, how can you be these thoughts?

You are able to observe even the observing of the thoughts, you are literally beyond on so many levels.

2023-05-10 14:16:04,Is Schizophrenia a mental illness? Or is it spiritual.,"So long story short I've spent half my life in psych wards as I'm child sex trafficking victim. 
( suicide attempts ) 

I don't have schizophrenia, however I've known & spoke to a lot of people who do have it. I'd like to talk briefly on a situation that occurred when I was in the psych ward once at 16. 

We were in the loungeroom area of the ward. 
My friend and I were sitting down, and there's a half wall made to separate the dining area and the loungeroom. Her back was against the half wall (in the loungeroom) and I'm standing up, facing the dining room. 

Now my friend was shaking and said she was seeing things, and decribed a security guard (who none of us have seen before) she didn't say a security guard to be exact, she described his arm tattoo, his hair, the colour of his skin, weight, height, everything. And then she hits herself and tells me she's so crazy. 
About 30 seconds later, a security guard with the EXACT details she's just told me she's seen, walks into the ward and into the dining area. 

She cannot possibly see him, or known he was there at all as she has no vision whatsoever of the dining room. And he walked into the ward after she described him.

2021-08-09 12:22:34,Psychedelic Gatekeeping,"Has anyone seen the documentary ""Fantastic Fungi?"" There's a scene I can't stop thinking about: a cancer patient walks into a psychotherapist's office, takes a pill of psilocybin, lies down on a couch wearing a blindfold, and then is tucked into a blanket by the female therapist, who at one point is shown holding the man's hand and telling him, ""You're doing great,"" or something like that.

I don't know about you, fellow psychonauts, but as someone who has tripped a lot in her life, this looks like the most boring possible way to experience psychedelics, and it really saddens me to think of this becoming the dominant psychedelic story in the current zeitgeist.

As much as I loved the film for the actual data spouted by actual scientists, and even the palpable excitement of various mycophiles (I was wearing the 4D glassed of a 1.5g dose, LOL), I was very disheartened by the condemnation of those of us who use psychedelics for fun, and by the attempt to stuff psilocybin-containing mushrooms into this box of ""spiritual/therapeutic experience."" Like, I'm really happy for you if that's your exclusive experience with psychedelics and you are happy with that, AND please refrain from demonizing the use of psychedelics as a ""party drug"" - in fact, some of my deepest, most spiritual  trips have taken place at EDM parties in the desert and in the forest, sharing a thumping dance floor with a hundred other tripping people. There's a reason why many traditional ceremonies incorporate music and dance, and you'll never know it if all of your trips take place on a therapist's couch.

A wise magician once told me that mushrooms are the children of the psychedelic family, and children like to play. Another wise hippie told me many times that MAPS does not want psychedelics to be legal for you and me, the implication being that they have their own agenda.

This may be an unpopular opinion on this sub, but I do not want psychedelics to be legalized. They are prolific, they are plants and fungi, and they grow whether sanctioned or not (except LSD, that problem child). I don't want to give these would-be shamans the satisfaction of gatekeeping an experience with substances that has been freely mine since I was 18. I have so much more to say , but this feels like the place to leave the topic open for discussion.

&#x200B;

Editing to say: Nowhere do I say that psychedelics should not be used in a therapeutic setting. My issue is with the elevation of that experience and the demonization of using them in whatever setting you choose.

Also, for the record, I do believe in decrim, but I've lived long enough to see what happens when substances get legalized for strictly medicinal and recreational purposes. I voted for legalization of marijuana in California in 2016, and after working in the industry, I truly regret it. Weed was better served under 215 and decrim. ",23,2889,2,498,1

While I do see a lot of validity in these theories, one perspective I spoke about in length with a friend is that maybe they just believe this is the best way for humans to be handled‚Ä¶

Essentially, we believe the elite are evil or have negative intentions for society, but we have to remember that these people control the world. Therefore, they have an abundance of profound knowledge and a better understanding of our existence in this universe. It‚Äôs likely that they know a whole lot more than me and you. 

So now you have to question, what do they know, or what did they experience, that led them to believe that this is the correct course for humanity to go down? We do not actually know whether their intentions are evil or good, we can only assume.

Limitless>limited. Infinite>finite. Universe>human.","*‚ùóÔ∏èPlease read these edits carefully instead of getting mad at the title and misinterpreting what I‚Äôm saying‚ùóÔ∏è-

Intro-

Narcissism is *GOOD* when everyone is being included in the ultimate *one whole* that is being gratified; the universe. 

Everything is beautiful, and we‚Äôre all part of it. This is the ultimate gratification and admiration of one‚Äôs self(s). I‚Äôm conceptually describing this to be the ‚Äúultimate narcissistic state‚Äù 
Most people are taking the definition of narcissism and taking it literal (looking at the mirror at yourself,thinking you‚Äôre the shit)  instead of conceptualizing the meaning as they should because inherently psychedelic experiences are conceptual. 

A concept is a object of thought that does not really on *literal or factual* definitions. I hope the average person here can wrap their mind around that.

I think people felt personally attacked when they read ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a god‚Äù so they immediately closed themselves off to what I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not god‚Äù is directed at 90% of post on this sub of people claiming that they felt like god, or that we are god, or a part of god. 

*Edit; Addressing what I mean by *‚Äùyou‚Äôre not a god‚Äù* I‚Äôm not calling myself god nor did I say I felt like god. I‚Äôm actually rejecting the idea of god as an erroneous misconception of what actually is, the inanimate universe full of things. That there is no such thing as ‚Äúgod‚Äù and even the conceptual idea of god as the universe is erroneous. God is not a man, and god is not the universe,god is not sand,god is not air, these things are just inanimate matter. I understand that some of you find it ‚Äúdeep‚Äù to understand to the universe and it‚Äôs contents in its entirety as ‚Äúgod‚Äù but in doing so you‚Äôre just contaminating your ability to understand what actually is. If the universe is god, and the universe is all there is. Why cloud the idea by referring to it as god?what value, does referring to the universe as god add to the conversation besides a shallow feeling of ‚Äúawe‚Äù? God is just a notion people give the universe to easily summarize what they can‚Äôt articulate.*

*Further Edit: Narcissism; Noun: excessive interest in !or  admiration of oneself¬°. I would say that saying ‚ÄúI am god/we‚Äôre god‚Äù fits the description* 

*Further further edit; I‚Äôve had multiple 4-12gram mushroom trips, 200ug-800ug LSD trips and DMT trips. Do not come at me like I‚Äôve only tripped once. This is a summary of the realizations I had during my first trip that I am still working on to this day years later*

*Further further further edit; I never claimed to be infallible, or claimed to know everything. I actually don‚Äôt know shit*

‚Äî‚Äî

Synopsis: With the ultimate understanding of selflessness because we are all one comes the ultimate gratifying feeling of love of ones self(s)(even if one is all and all is one,it‚Äôs still one unified thing being gratified)that is what I‚Äôm referring to as the ultimate narcissistic state, a state of ultimate admiration of ones self(s) because all is one,one is all. Therefor we must love and gratify ourselves/one another because we all build ourselves on the same fundamental consciousness. Everything is beautiful and we‚Äôre part of it,this is the ultimate admiration or narcissistic state.

‚Äî‚Äî

It‚Äôs interesting to me that many people don‚Äôt realize that ‚Äúego death‚Äù against popular belief is actually in a conceptual way the ultimate narcissistic state. My emotions went something like this;

On the come up there was fear and anxiety of this new experience and perception.
Then confusion and reluctancy to give in to the moment.
Then willingness to understand this experience.
Finally giving into the experience and letting go 
Observing myself as human and accepting my faults. 
Then this continued into a further regress, abandoning myself as a human and observing myself as a thing that exist.
I began to see fractals like a 3D Sierpinski triangle.
I realized that I am nothing but a self organized criticality quantum system, I am the universe like any other thing is part of the universe except I‚Äôm thinking of myself.
Then I felt my inevitably both in life and in death because I am the very laws of physics/existence.
So I existed outside of time and space, I was fundamental.
I began to think without words, words were meaningless, because I was in a state of fundamental thought ,‚ÄùI‚Äù became the base consciousness we all share, the blank fundamental canvas. 
Then I felt I was stretched so thin that I was nothing and everything at the same time.
This is when I felt the eternal love for all things.
This was bliss.
I was the universe, I was the totality thinking of itself, I had become the fundamental base consciousness, the blank canvas from which we all build ourselves. 
It‚Äôs like I was having sex with the universe and therefor myself.
Then in that very moment as I became to come down and regain my ability to construct thought I had an epiphany;
‚ÄúThis feeling‚Ä¶.this feeling is the ultimate, this feeling is the ultimate narcissistic state..I am not god, I am not part of god, the universe is not god because ‚Äúgod‚Äù is a misconception of what is, a frivolous idea from the start. God is an incomprehensible object of thought that only exist in the mind like a flying pig headed lion.

The only truth here is that I am a thing like any other thing that is a fundamental part of the universe and so I must treat these other things as equal parts of myself because we are all the same thing, and everything is beautiful. The only difference between me and an inanimate object is my ability to think of myself..and I choose to think of myself/everything as god?‚Äù
We‚Äôre not gods we‚Äôre just things, but we choose to think we‚Äôre something else..a human..a god..anything..and so in our naive narcissism we choose to be god.",293,5775,46,996,1
2022-04-13 16:46:34,Is any Psychonaut here also Transgender?,"I wanted to explore more of the history of shamanism and animism with transgenderism. Like the ""Two-Spirit"" people of indigenous North Americans, the ""Manang Bali"" shamans of Sarawak, the ""Ngaju Dayak basir"", ""bissu"", ""nat kadaw"", and ""hijra"", etc. The more I search, the more I uncover. It would be interesting to compile a complete list.

Edit after 48 minutes: Wow, I did not think posing this question would have blown up this much. It is very amusing!

Edit after 2 hours: I cannot wait for the great experiment. When I look like a woman, I will not be trans, anymore. I will be a man. I will dress like a man. I will talk like a man. I won't wear make-up. Someone will ask me why I dress like a man, and I will tell them because I'm a man. They'll ask me if I'm trans, and I'll say no, and ask them if they're trans. If they say that I look trans, I'll say that they have gay lips, and ask them if they're gay. I just hope I can keep a straight face. Oops, I meant... cis face.",40,983,6,190,1
2015-01-06 02:33:47,My Complete Understanding of the Universe.,"I like to think of myself as a seasoned psychonaut, despite my being 20 years of age. I have much more to learn, and many more experiences ahead of me, but I am very proud of some of the theories I have developed thanks to many of my psychedelic experiences. Without boasting, I'd like to say that I cherish my ability to think on this level. I think this is what has allowed me to integrate so much from my psychedelic experiences, and I hope you can all enjoy my point of view. 

I just spent a while trying to begin my explanation, and realized that if i wrote a several hundred page book it would still lack proper explanation, so I will make this brief. I will stick to two main points that are my favorites, and this explanation will not do justice to what i can observe within my mind, but it will have to do. 

What are you? and what am I? Well this can be easily explored through a thought experiment. I'm sure everyone would agree that 'you' live here in this world, which is comprised of matter and energy. You likely live in a house or an apartment, and you also likely have a body with legs, arms, internal organs, etc. These are all objective things that belong to you, and this can be shown simply by the language we use. This planet is YOUR environment, the arms and legs you have are parts of YOUR body. If we follow this logic then the human brain that is in your body is also YOUR brain. Now, to go a bit deeper, are you your mind? is that what YOU ARE? I don't think so. For example, when you have a random thought, that thought is something that you experience. It is something that you must observe, despite the fact that this observation is not facilitated by any of your sensory organs. So, I ask again, what are you? I have found that whatever it is, that can be ultimately and matter-of-factly defined as 'you', is the exact same thing that can be defined as 'me'. We are different people, with different thoughts and personalities, but these thoughts and personalities are equally a part of our environments as our planet earth is. Therefore what we really are, is one thing, one consciousness, flowing through all things, and taking on higher complexities when flowing through a human brain where an ego and a personality is formed. This one consciousness, itself, is personality-less it has no memories, it has no feelings, it is essentially nothing. It is the universe. This is why the tibetan buddhists will say ""the entire universe is inside you.""

Well then, what is the universe? Well-renowned physicists have done calculations, and they have come out with statements saying that the net mass of the universe is zero, and the net energy of the universe is also zero. This, to me, is a much easier concept to grasp than the idea that the universe just came out of nowhere. This means, really, that the universe didn't *come* from nothing, but rather it still *is* nothing. To illustrate this I will use very simple math. 0 by itself means nothing. it is nothing, and it will remain nothing forever, never allowing this reality we are perceiving to exist. However, if you allow 0=0 to be true, then we have something. You see, once zero equals itself, it is then something. and if zero can equal zero, it can take any possible path to that equation. for example 0=0 is the same as -1+1=0 or (infinity)-(infinity)=0. So what allows zero to be equal to itself? YOU. consciousness. The thing that is me, you, and everyone else. By observing itself, zero then becomes equal to itself. And that is what the entire universe is. It is zero trying to prove to itself that it is zero, by all means necessary. A perfect analogy to this is art. I see art as any conscious being creating something, just so that other conscious beings can subsequently observe this creation. By creating something, you are making a positive (+) thing come into existence, and by observing it, you are making a negative (-) and putting that thing back where it came from, which is from **nowhere**. This whole process is **fun and love**. The nothingness that is everything is just in a constant state of making fun of itself. When people go to a concert, since all of the people involved (the musicians and all of the observers) are all the same exact thing (the entire universe) the musicians are creating lots of sound and light (from the void) for the performance, and all of the observers are then observing it, gobbling it all up, experiencing the sound and light and sending it right back into the void. This is fun. This is the nothingness of the universe making itself very vivid and apparent to itself, and it is beautiful. 

So, my friends, to summarize:

Nothing is real.

**Nothing** (which is something) is **very real** indeed. 

YOU are IT!

2021-07-24 00:22:37,"I don't draw the line, but taking mushrooms or DMT and thinking that you've experienced the highest power of the universe is quite naive","So much it's talked about how people truly feel like they have experienced the highest possible consciousness experience, truly being in the center of the universe, personally meeting with the gods.. Yes what you are experiencing truly is a higher power, there is no doubt that the experience IS a higher power - something that is able to take a hold of human consciousness like that in such a profound way is something worth considering .. but really your mind is tapping into the experience. The mushroom or dmt is giving your mind the password to an experience that it was built for, otherwise it wouldn't be able to work. meaning what you're experiencing is something that is as you as any of the other profound experiences you've had ... the last time you ate a really well cooked masterful meal you did not say that it was God or the highest power but it was profound and was able to take a hold of your conscious experience ... give that very well cooked meal to a tribe a thousand years ago surviving off of seal blubber and they would claim that it was truly a gift from the highest power of the universe (maybe) .. the same way we naively take DMT or mushrooms and trick ourselves into thinking that we're truly coming face to face with God and the highest power ... No ... probably not .... and if yes then that would also mean that drinking a cup of coffee is you tapping into God . There really is nothing black and white knowable that proves that DMT and mushrooms show us God and show us the truth . They are just insanely weird and profoundly POWERFUL experiences that we have a LOT of work to do uncovering - Telling yourself after a couple trips that you KNOW what it is and that you met  - entities - or - gods - that have a black and white message to tell you that you can repeat in the English language is just naive beyond words. Just because the experience goes well over your ability to comprehend doesn't mean you've met God.",136,1950,24,364,1
2020-01-30 19:06:35,Why I am unsubscribing from r/psychonaut,"I have grown weary of this place, and my belief that psychedelic users were more thoughtful people had been seriously challenged.

2023-05-16 17:16:32,"Abusing Mushroom, telepathy, ESP, and dark entity possession. Fuck around and you will find out","During a mushroom trip between my ex and I as we were experiencing experiencing some minor telepathy ( a regular occurrence between us by now ) I started to fall into a very dark and negative head space, one of the worst imaginable perverted intrusive thoughts relating to her traumas, her son, and disturbing kinky roleplay entered my headspace seemingly out of nowhere. I tried to brush it off but she sensed something really off and called me back into her room ( we were tripping away from each other due to recent tension between us). I was going through my own shit and acting really childish and usually i handle myself very well on trips, she was trying to tune in with me telepathically and getting frustrated with me and i told her i needed to speak to me and was trying really hard to tune in but kept getting los55555tttrfufvfr yyyyyyht in the outer stimuli of her face warping in a really demonic fashion i had never seen before. We start talking about very deep traumas involving what I had mentioned earlier, and almost had a major breakthrough, super vulnerable healing moment and then boom, out of absolutely nowhere we tuned back in and the same intrusive thought instantly sent to her headspace before I could even suppress it or realize that it was about to happen, as usually i did really well as letting the thoughts flow away and not fight them but that was just too disturbing for me to ignore. As one can imagine, she freaked out majorly and the next thing that happened we could only describe as psychic witchcraft/ a half assed exorcism that only pissed off the spirit even more. In and instant her face went blank, she claimed ""MY ANCESTORS ARE CALLING ME"" she said I needed to trust her and that I was not going to remember this, ( I remember it all). she had me down on her bed and she was on top of me looking at me with a face full of PURE RAGE driven by her motherly love and protection, she said "" i am done being nice to you"" she looked me deep into my eyes with a gaze deeper than anyone has lied upon me, and as she did this, her fucking pupils began to fucking glow green and I felt the whole energy in the room change. I was freaked out because i thought she had always known she could do this and was either a demon or alien or both on the downlow lmao. I tried to stare back to look at her in her eyes and kept saying ""DONT FIGHT ME YOU WONT WIN' in the most demented fucking voice. I had never seen her nor anyone like this and she could see I was getting shaken up and starting to cry, she said ""its okay babe you're going to be okay trust me, then she covered up the eye she looked in when she said that, looked into the other and fucking said ""i'm talking to YOU, not HIM. STOP TRYING TO FIGHT ME, YOU THINK YOU ARE SCARING ME, IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?""  as she did this I could literally feel two different fucking energies inside my head, on the covered side it was a pure version of me that once was when I was big into lightwork, and positive empathy in spirituality, and she told me he wasn't going to win and i could beat it, I could feel my good side winning but parasitic entity  had start to win at this point, but she still had a good hold on her own energy while protecting the entities energy from entering her own aura. she asked what it I was and the entity responded through me ""nothing, I am nobody"" she began to get defensive yet protective over the real me and said ""leave this boy alone, he has a life to live, you will not take him down"" what she did next is the part i really do not enjoy sharing with anyone. after that she began talking to the entity again saying ""he could not harm her, she was not afraid because she created me, and that I would stay on the wheel of karma forever ( the entity) and her eyes were glowing bright fucking scary fluorescent green at this point. This was just bout the end when she had me bow down to her, kiss her feet, to humiliate me/ the entity, Then had me lay face up on her bed, not allowed to move or blink until she came back into the room. when she came back. she intuitively knew to snap or something and helped me up off the bed because my whole body and limbs felt extremally weak. She asked me what I remembered and I told her all of it... that was the most extreme part of it.  I was obviously very traumatized and she saw and i think she realized what she did was a huge fuck up because although I consider myself to be a rather empathetic, genuine and sweet guy, it was evident that something very dark had latched onto my ego and that is where my suicidal thoughts had cane from and that it was making me do dumb shit like act out towards her. For the rest of the night she would get super angry at me when she would try to talk to me and id exhibit ADHD like symptoms by hitting the vape while she talked or interrupting her its like I was in a state of disassociation after being extremely fucking traumatized and unable to process what just happened. She then said we had to break up and that we could never happen ever again. She concluded that mental illness is caused by demonic entities ( an ignorant statement ) and also pressed her other views onto me that only hurt even more. I lived with her for about 9 more days after we broke up and all of what we used to be as a couple was gone. she admitted to me that since we got into the psychic/ telepathy stuff with each other that she would use her mind to control me. I began having sleep paralysis stronger than i had ever expereinced in my life and saw her In a demonic form, resembling how she looked in active addiction to meth ( we are in recovery), and i could only break free by calling out to the name of Jesus. prior to this night she was enthused by satanism, but was more so a poser looking for a rebellious aesthetic. she dropped that shit after that experience.  I dont know what she did, or what a lot of it meant but after that incident I became super manic, convinced I had to do all I can to rid myself of this entity, this was back in decembe, ive slowly been healing since we had to go full on no contavt for likelt the rest of our lives ( her decision). She hurt me very badly but knows she cant do anything about it. Since we started full 0 contact whatsoever some really scary shit has happened since then involving another strong instance of telepathy from her while staying in different cities in moments where i felt like i was dying ( she broke no contact on this exception to validate the experience and ensure my safety but has since returned to 0 contact after i wouldnt buy her dumbass some tickts to a rave). there would be mornings i woke up for months on end fully aware our line of telepathy was still open and our ESP towards eachother after being so deeply empathetic towars another ( i conviced myself so atleast) ive since had to rewrite my beliefs on everything srruounding the event as it caused me to go into a full blown spiritual psychosis mental breakdown. resulting in a relapse on mh end after 8 months clean.... im now seeking professional mental health counseling. I know what i experienced.. theres some more instances for example i may have to tell on here abother time. This is the first time ive shared this all in full detail to best of my current ability, as going this deep into it really triggers a lot of feelings and panic attacks towards the situation......

2022-04-27 06:48:59,anybody else concerned by the spiritual aspect of psychedelics that‚Äôs commonly promoted on phsych substance subs?,"
As someone who‚Äôs tripped many times I fully understand there‚Äôs a lot of benefits to these substances. I‚Äôve personally changed for the better due to some trips in my past. These substances can also just be a good time. 

That being said a lot of people think that there‚Äôs a level deeper than reflecting on the self, something spiritual in nature. A lot of people I‚Äôve met on this sub and IRL who‚Äôve taken this stuff believes that the images, unique perspective, and large amount of introspection is a way to connect with spirituality through drug use. 

That‚Äôs where I start to disagree for several reasons.

1: this narrative further delegitimizes the phsyc substance movement. Many people in power use this aspect of the psyc substance community to discredit the benefits, arguing that these substances lead to delusion and shuttering of responsibilities in life. I strongly disagree with that statement, not because it doesn‚Äôt happen but because the same issue arises with almost anything. Overeating, alcoholism, etc. That being said there are some valid concerns brought up. I know many people will flock to the comments to disagree with this next statement but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen in my life. 70% of the users who Ive see go full spirituality and ‚Äúkill their egos‚Äù are giant assholes only concerned with themselves. A lot of these people turn away from society but fail to realize that it‚Äôs impossible to completely cut away from society without effecting others around you. 

2: the culture around science in this community needs change. when cavemen looked up at the sun in all it‚Äôs brilliance, they couldn‚Äôt explain how it could possibly work so they went with something ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù as the creator, as in god. I feel like we‚Äôre at a similar point in psychedelics, where people aren‚Äôt aware of how this drug can change our minds so drastically, leading to people jumping on the spirituality thought train.

I‚Äôm no expert, no wise sage, just a guy who‚Äôs noticed some stuff. would you guys agree with this? disagree with parts? has my experience been similar to others here? let me know below

edit: to be clear I have no issue with people using spirituality as a way to think about one‚Äôs self, improve relationships with others, improve stability in one‚Äôs life, or a plethora of other benefits. I‚Äôm specifically talking about the group of people who use spirituality as a way to avoid the problems of the real world they live in.",113,2433,16,416,1

2016-02-12 01:16:02,"The truth, the only truth about every one of you and myself. This is the post you need to read.","I'm very deeply sorry to give you this information but: today you take LSD and think Maynard is Jesus, tomorrow you could be in an alcohol inhibited depression. There is no safety or spiritual progression linked to use of psychedelics, you are treading the path of obsession leading to nowhere. You have likely invested your remaining youth into a dead end and wrapped it with hallmarks of pretty words fed to you by people who wanted to sell books and lecture seats. You and I are, sadly, idiots.

It's 2016 and I see every day on this subreddit people posting the same rehashed ideas that I once posted, the same re-imagining of what occurs during a trip. But you don't know what happens and you shouldn't think you do know. Saying you have the slightest idea is an act of violence against the substance and myself and any supposed spiritual movement. Clinging to substance as anything at all is a sure sign of a sick materially obsessed set of people. This culture is substituting the unknown for a kind of nostalgia for a journey that is GONE. Psychedelics are always GONE, they do not stick around, the effects are self nullifying. There is no wisdom, knowledge or insight to be maintained. Your first grasp at the wisdom was your first step into your struggle. When you first heard about psychedelics, you were better off. With your preconceptions you still had a sense of wonder. Now you are a truth fiend who isn't really looking, who is just plucking the wings of the butterfly or stamping it into your book. Mckenna did say this, he acknowledged constantly that he was a fool of no importance, and take a look at him, he was obsessed with information, overly intellectual and entirely sophistic. You are a fool as well. I am not ashamed to call any psychonaut a fool any more, not that there is anything wrong with being a fool, but I must gag at the cult religion you have going on in your head. Your diaries, your posts, your thoughts: all a symptom of your suffering. Gatherings like this forum are wells for the glossolalia that comes out of the deeply disturbed mind of a psychedelic substance user. The way your words are arranged are random, your references to ancient culture totally irrelevant to what happened. The only reaction with any sense is to become silent. If you truly had any gall, you would see this forum as what it is, a collection of terrified humans who had their nervous system turned upside down, who translate their terror into a cathartic frenzy of words. I do this all the time. This is not such a text, I am here to tell you that we are idiots, hated and uncaringly misunderstood by 99% of the population. A fringe collection of culture which exists nowhere else. We have no church, no finger on the button and no superior consciousness with which to build any of these things, we are dispersed among straight people at such a ratio that there is no hope for anything we say being 'true'. True is what the 7 billion say, not some idiots who thought they saw God whilst intoxicated. the rest of them will die to spite us, we don't have the self awareness or meekness of Sadhus, we don't ingratiate ourselves to the culture of others. We instead maintain our ideology more religiously than anyone else. All others are only half into their religion or culture, we on the other hand continue to take these substances, we self torture for the sake of some pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. LSD is self torture, being ecstatic for a temporary period is taunting that we can't take. You heed my words, there will be a sad day when you realize it was all bullshit, and there will be no priest to terrorize you to keep going, no doctor to heal you and no ear to listen to your story. You will be a single fool totally alone in his self delusion. A religion of one based on something you know is fraudulent. You won't be able to drop it, it was too big. Too ecstatic and iconic in your life. Like the cross but your own personal cross shared with no one. You will only be able to share it using the pure shit memes sold by dead philosophers of the seventies and nineties. The whole thing cannot progress. It has taken the philosophy of science, that all things progress and divide to become more detailed. But psychedelics tell you that this isn't the case. Things get more simple, indescribable. You will be an island, like an insane person. So you must either hide or join the stupid masses in a constant enforcement of childish religion.

Don't you see? 'Psychonaut' is the new pilgrimage or child soldier gone to sacrifice himself for his God, to fight a holy war. Only this time its a god spawned by the intellectual individualism of the twentieth and twenty first century. The idea of an individual ego conquering the divine using his commitment and suffrage. His weapon is science, he uses it to extract logic from religions designed to trick ignorant poor people in ancient times. Meditation, yoga, Book of the dead, all taken from their original context and made into memes to be freely manipulated by every teenager with a computer. It's an extreme bounce back from the extreme nihilism of the nineties, a vast fluctuation from total lack of meaning to total meaning. This can't happen, this can't be true, reality can't just be this thing which changes by the whim of ignorant adolescent monkeys! Whatever information you feed off of is your reality, you are feeding from the collective trough as much as brother peter at your local church only you are the minority now, even more than him. You are the minority to the vast collection of starving poor people who want what you have. They take your sheets of acid and spit on them and trample them. You are the minority of one, like a shaman, except you don't serve the people like a shaman, you only consume. You aren't a monk feeding children, you aren't a shaman healing the sick, you aren't even a student of wisdom, you are a movie goer, childish and suggestible to everything that comes your way. The capitalists will eat you alive if drugs are ever made legal and put in their hands

 you are not 'enlightened'. You cannot possess enlightenment. No amount of LSD or DMT will reveal yourself to yourself. Any one moment of awakening slips away into memory. Listening to Alan Watts is pure television, totally entertainment value. Anything you say is a rehashed series of noises, everything I write here is my profession of total depression and despair from realizing this. You are like the Zen neophyte monks who drove themselves crazy with their struggles, only you exist in a society that demands so much of your brain that you must be in a million imaginary cultures at once. You have no one track, you are just an ape seeking a trance state where there aren't 7 billion other apes on an asinine self annihilation trip. In my perspective, one culture can never win over any other now. Culture is so very equipped with the power of information and interconnection the likes of which were never imagined by Terence Mckenna, that everyone is on equal ground in their ignorance. Any one thing said becomes null immediately and is only proved by the might of the speaker's resolve. Muslims have this resolve, politicians have this resolve. You do not. You will be destroyed for proffesing your 'spiritual awakening'. 

The ideology maintained here has just been repackaged into sound bites for the generation that doesn't really care. I don't care. I always pretended to care, but really I just want my video games and a place to lie down. I don't have the necessary innocence or the faith to commit to discovering some supposed truth, I only seek to manipulate the people who I despise for their enslavement of my body so I can get my daily bread. I truly long for the death of every human being and their heinous activity, I despise every one of you because you are all liars. YOU ARE LYING TO YOURSELF AND CONCURRENTLY ME. I know you are a liar because I am a liar. You're not different than me, even the most ecstatic and happy among you are liars. You want truth, sex, happiness, everything. You don't know what it is or why you should want it, you just want it all. You're trained consumers for corporations, any other ideas were never in the briefing of the industrial era from which your personalities derive, no matter what globalized society you come from. All will bend the knee to global capitalism until everything explodes. You are a poor person and you have my infinite sympathy, as if you were my self, if not empathy as if you were me. Because you are me, we are one in our greed and corruption and lies. I love you because I know that we aren't really this. That this is the projection. Believe me, I tried to be what Terence Mckenna wanted me to be, I tried to meditate and I tried to find God. But sadly it was corrupted from day one.

Calling you fools would be to call myself a fool, and doing this would be insincere because I am as deep in the psychedelic schlock as you all are. But it is the nature of our generation to be insincere, we have to be to survive the gun to our head. The gun of McDonalds and Donald Trump and organised religion and terrorism and all the other public interest consumable garbage that so many accept loudly. We just accept it without a word, we just nod because it is the only way to maintain dignity in defeat. We lost the culture war, it's all over.

I have landed at a point of frustrated depression which prompts advancement from this clinging to substance and ideology, but I can not get away from it. I am imprisoned by my choices to pursue so called spirituality, imprisoned by who I've said I am to myself, what I believe. I'm a psychonaut, the two faced hypocrite produced by TV culture, the fiend willing to lie and cheat my fellow man. Most of all, I'm a basic human underneath with a lizard brain, none of you mean anything to me because I don't remember you, you are just an empty symbol like everything else I believe. Even my parents are objects to be manipulated because they manipulated me from day one. Like yours did. They sold us on capitalism and banks and language.

2022-05-11 21:29:42,how to convince grandfather to do acid with me?,"does anyone on this forum have experience tripping with older people? i‚Äôve had to live with my grandparents for about a year now after being forced out of my mom‚Äôs house following my ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù (story for another time), and have been trying to get my grandpa to drop some acid with me. 

they have a nice house and a lot of acreage but there really isn‚Äôt anything to do there other than drugs. so a lot of the time i‚Äôll just strip down at night and take medium doses in the forest. i will stay out there for hours just watching insects crawl next to me on the ground or staring at trees; it‚Äôs seriously a great time. 

however, it does get a little lonely doing this over and over all the time so i want a trip buddy. and my grandpa seems like the perfect candidate. you should hear the way he yells at my grandma after having a few too many, it‚Äôs fucking hilarious üòÇ but whenever i bring it up to him, he bitches out and starts going on tangents about his PTSD from his time in the military. but it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ wtf? do you not realize that your PTSD would seriously lessen if you took psychs? they did wonders for me, i used to be such a little shit. 

any advice on how to convince him to come around? i don‚Äôt want to be too forceful but he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that acid would help him immensely. i‚Äôve thought about microdosing his morning coffee but i read a magazine article that suggested it was unethical. thank you in advance, rock on üöÄ",47,1447,9,277,1

2022-07-10 08:13:59,I think the pyramids were solar panels,"I've been watching a bunch of documentaries on the building of the pyramids and a lot of the interpretations of the hieroglyphs bothered me, I think we underestimate ancient civilizations. I understand that the pyramids were tombs for the pharoahs after their death, but the civilization was clearly solar powered, they harnessed the energy of the sun to be able to heat & cool their cities as they liked, but why would they just stop at controlling the temperature? By being able to absorb and manipulate heat they could easily figure out light, and heat can also very easily be used to cut rocks, so all of this confusion about how the stones were cut doesn't make sense to me. So the interpretation of the hieroglyph as just being the soul of the pharoah rising up to heaven from the pyramids doesn't make sense to me, I think it's the light from heaven shining down onto the pyramid, the top of which absorbs the suns rays, spreads it down into the walled off cities through the various tunnels giving them access to various technologies. I think its really arrogant to assume that just because they didn't use cranes & pullies it had to have been human labour, I think they were a little more sophisticated than we give them credit for which is why their civilization has endured. I also reject the premise that this is the first epoch in which electricity & solar energy and light and stuff have been figured out in all of human history, I think we left a lot of information in many dark ages & modern hubris and propaganda would like us to believe that we are the most sophisticated civilization ever.

2020-05-15 05:23:37,"Cannabis is NOT a psychedelic, nor are Salvia, ketamine, etc. and here's why.","I'm not denying the subjective visionary effects from weed, or from anything. Personally my most visually intense ""trip"" ever was from just Cannabis. But calling weed psychedelic is pharmacologically incorrect and we shouldn't be saying that. This is /r/psychonauts, not /r/drugs. If you're a psychonaut then you need to know the significance of the words you're using.

""Psychedelic"" does not just mean ""makes you see things"" or ""makes you trip out."" The list of substances that can create effects like this is endless. You could go into your bathroom right now and eat a handful of benadryl and you'll see shit that isn't there, you'll get into a really abnormal headspace. Would you call diphenhydramine a psychedelic then? That would do a huge disservice to true psychedelics - tryptamines, phenethylamines, lysergamides - things that **act on the 5HT2A receptor.**

Or think of it this way - Cannabis relieves some types of pain for some people. Ketamine and other dissociatives can also relieve pain via anesthesia - even cocaine (more so its common adulterant lidocaine) can topically numb pain signals. But would you ever call these substances *opioids*? Absolutely not, the opioid receptors are involved in the body's natural endorphin system and the relief brought on by opioids is more than just their analgesic efficacy. Anything that numbs you and makes you feel fine doesn't make it an opioid, or else alcohol would be an opioid. Try giving a heroin junkie a case of beer instead of his daily bag, see how far that gets you.

The states brought on by 5HT2A activity are unique and deserve their own category and their own title to that category - hence the coining of the term ""psychedelic."" This does not mean that they are the only class of drugs that can make you ""trip."" Salvia is the most obvious example of this, as far as we can tell it achieves its effects via intense *antagonism* of a specific type of opioid receptor, yet the visionary states brought on by salvia are rivaled only by the likes of DMT and cousins in terms of intensity and profundity. But a Salvia trip is at the same time a **completely alien experience even compared to that of DMT** or 5MeO - lumping Salvia in as a psychedelic betrays true psychs and perhaps even more so to Salvia itself.

See what I'm saying here? There's a special character common to things like psilocybin, LSD, Ayahuasca, mescaline, etc. that is unique to these substances. You may have subjectively comparable experiences without touching 5HT2A and nobody's discounting that, but using the same word and putting them in the same category is extremely misleading and potentially harmful to those who are looking to learn more about psychedelics or psychoactives in general. The word psychedelic was invented to describe the ineffable quality of the 5HT2A serotonergic experience.

You can look to words like ""hallucinogenic,"" ""deliriant,"" ""trippy,"" ""visionary"" to describe these kinds of experience, or you can say that an experience was ""somewhat psychedelic,"" but claiming that a drug with no 5HT2A activity ""is a psychedelic"" is just a misunderstanding of the word.",77,3136,13,521,1
2022-08-18 13:09:44,soulbombing bad trip,"So, yesterday I tried acid and shrooms combo. Me and my friend (Anne) took half a tab and half shrooms portion, also we hadn‚Äôt slept the night before because of speed. 
So we take acid around 6:30pm, shrooms around hour later. The trip was good, at first, we were chilling in the forest, then watched the sunset, I took a swim in the sea. At night we went to a public gathering, chose a place with a hammock, my friend was looking at lights, while I was facing the forest. We were waiting for a friend(Tim) to escort us home, because none of us wanted to walk alone in the forest. 
Never really liked dark, I always saw things in there, would hear voices or things. I started seeing tall figures looking at me, trying to grab me. Also, for a while I was thinking about self healing and mind explanatory trip, because I started feeling depressed again, and just had a lot of miss understanding in myself. 
Some time later the figures started moving more, making some noise, I started thinking about my traumas and then every each figure started coming at me, showing most stressful situations in my life. 
I was on on mute, couldn‚Äôt speak, didn‚Äôt move. Maybe an hour later Tim came, when I looked at him, his face was distorted, no eyes, a creepy smile and a really really big shadow behind him. I got scared and hid under blanket. He started scolding us, why did we mixed acid and shrooms, Anne started crying, and then I started dissociating, I could hear his voice from far away, like from a some kinda of tunnel, breathlessly. Everything was coming down hill, for me he was really rough, also probably because he was husky. When we finally got ready to go home, Anne was okay, but I couldn‚Äôt look up, because everywhere i saw those figures, for 30 or more minutes, all the way home i was looking only at my feet and crying. 

Is this possible to have such a bad trip and feel it so strongly if we took really small dosages? 
Or it could also be because I was tired, didn‚Äôt sleep, because all night was snorting speed?",20,2020,3,374,1
2018-05-31 13:13:51,LSD and Aya helped me be transgender,"After many trips, it gradually became clear to me that gender was basically just a set of aesthetic conventions. Some things ""look masculine"" or ""look femme"", from the perspective of our current moment in human culture.

There's no True Self or True Mind or True Biology. Everything changes, everything can be changed - and our lives are a series of choices of what kind of person to be, what things to embody.  My preferences are my own, my aesthetic is my own, and these things are the unfolding of my changing self.

I prefer to be trans. I like what synthetic hormones do to my body, same as how I like what synthetic neurotransmitters do to my mind.

I will live, I will change, I will eventually die. In this time, I choose my own direction.

I like being trans. I like the way it looks and feels to be trans. Since I am alive, I can do whatever I want with myself. So why not be trans?

I choose to be trans. My choices are my ""real self"" because they are the reality I construct - and I don't mean ""I can believe whatever crazy shit I want and that's Real To Me lol"" - I construct my reality out of molecules and cells, blood and sweat, fabric and makeup, right here in the real world, out of physical stuff.

So I can't change my chromosomes. Whatever. You ever seen a chromosome? They're tiny! They're only one part of a complex system. Everybody's got something weird about themselves. No one thing defines the whole.

To have a preference for how to be, but to not act on it, would be to try block the flow of change. Change will happen anyway, though. Why not use it to go where you wanna go? Be who you wanna be?

...

OK OK OK also Lady Aya told me that She's recruiting for an all-transfeminine army to overthrow capitalism and eliminate the concept of nation states, and she's putting the call out for men with access to power, money, or influence of any kind to switch teams.

2022-06-11 10:56:06,"Psychedelics make your ""need-to-be-accepted"" instinct go nuts and its a bad thing.","I experienced this myself and also noticed it on others. Psychedelics make you overanalyze your behavior and how people around you respond to it. If you find out that they respond badly, you give yourself hell for it. Oh no i'm disgusting, asocial, weird, ""autistic"", etc. You then change your behavior specifically to cater to the sick society around you and call it the greatest most transforming experience of your life. The thing is, if you dropped acid while growing up in nazi Germany, your great transformation would very likely consist of becoming a nazi.

And its not like this world is a rational healthy place. Its not that far from nazi Germany even. Psychedelics tell you that its you that's the problem, but what if its not you? Yes it very much can be the case that everyone around you is wrong and you are the only one who is right. You see, i come from a family where abuse runs deep as hell. Nobody is able to form healthy relationships. Damaged people pair with other damaged people and have kids that they abuse. This cycle of abuse is a well documented phenomenon. And human society is kind of like an abusive family.

So please don't let the psychedelics lie to you about that stuff. I did when i was a teenager and it was pretty damaging. It took me a long time to figure this out and psychedelics made it even longer imho.

I've seen some people on the internet claim that psychedelics ""cured their autism"" and it breaks my heart smh.

And hot girls would send photos, because that's what hot girls do. And this hot girl in particular would get very excited and she would start screaming, ""That's me!"".

2022-04-10 18:38:25,Psychedelics without spirituality are pointless.,"Half year ago I've wrote that post: [Spirituality without psychedelics is pointless.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/p5bkld/spirituality_without_psychedelics_is_pointless/)

I kind of went for that controversial look and got some nice discussion from all of you. This time it has struck me that spirituality is also about knowing yourself, self-growth and so on. That other post was about external part like incense, talismans, stones or even art. This time I wanted to talk about this other, internal side.

I think I am going around yet another lap of being a psychedelic-preacher to just thinking I shouldn't care about spreading the news. I have a one particular friend who just happens to be tripping with me since like 3 years on and off, sometimes it's a private party, sometimes one on one. At this point I've realized that we don't really share any interests to be honest other than psychedelics - the thing is we both like it. Liking is the only part because our experiences are sooo, soooo much different. I can't explain why, but for me even the trips that were supposed to be fun always ended up as life-changing, opening up to something new, making me progress in life - be it grieving, loneliness, addiction, made me study more, made me take up therapy. For Him it was always colors, morphing and music. He started with Lucy, tripped around 5-6 times and peaked on around 300ug - which at the same party made me see a freaking DMT-like entity emerge in my bathroom. Lately he tried shrooms for the first time - for me shrooms never did a profound thing, but I've never done them in the set and setting as LSD. I guided him, we went one on one, chill setting, talked about going to the internal world and so on, he was ready. We even meditated. Yet he still haven't got mind-blowing, spiritual experience.

While I moved from my parents, started college, met my first love, dropped out, found a job, got into other college, started therapy, broke up, started working on my relationships all together, experienced new music tastes, started to work on my insecurities, addressed my traumas, found new hobbies, started going out... I can't even list it all - he just stayed who he was. And no offense in that, but all that time I was thinking that psychedelics made me change and I am slowly realizing it was just me. Psychs just speed up leveling me up with each another trip. And we both started as couple of socially-awkward nerds.


--**Digression about me**--

Am I just a spiritual person? None of the people around me who tired psychedelics changed that much and I get the clear feedback that I've changed a hell of a lot both from my parents and friends. I am gonna assume it's something good, but it makes me crave someone like that in my life. I want somebody who will grow with me and for now, even childhood friendships feel like driving on the highway with each lamp post being another human being. I can't stop just for one of them.

I would want to say something like ""I am better"", ""I am woke"" and ""I grow personally"" and know it's bullshit. But it's not. I am constantly struggling to live up to something. Even before psychedelics when all my friends were busy grinding another video game I wanted to learn digital art - and what follows my every new hobby - make my friends fall in love with it too. Which of course never happened. Is it my entitlement that I always believe that my hobbies worth introducing my friends into? Is it my ego that tries to prove everybody that I want to grow and change for the better? In the end I want to become better person both for me and them.

It makes me feel lonely. I want people to resonate with me, with what I like or to resonate with what they like. To watch a movie together and at least be on the same level of understanding it - Have you ever got the ""I understand the lyrics"" moment after listening to a certain song after a long time? I would want to make people feel that when I feel it - or the other way around which is also hard for me. Friends recommend me some anime from time to time and none of it was good for me. It feels bad actually. Same with music. I listen to newschool rap/hip-hop and look towards lyrics, they listen to the beat. I started listening to Tool and dive into the lyrics and composing - they don't even like that too much. Even the trippy friend just doesn't seem to get Lateralus lyrics.

--**end of digression**--

In conclusion I think that maybe it's **psychedelics** that get pointless really fast without the **spirituality part**. I love the visuals, colors and so on. But how fun can it be if there are no emotions around that, no growth no change? Even weed makes me go into the VR versions of Alex Grey's paintings. It makes it even worse that on the Internet there are always people who I can find and are into the same things as I. But it's like reading 9-star reviews of your favorite movie.

2014-03-02 12:59:32,ever heard of a self induced DMT trip?,"I felt like the biggest piece of shit, abandoning my brother, while he was in the middle of so much strife, but what could i do? the plane ticket was already bought, if i stayed, i could have gotten fucked for underage smoking, and there was just no getting out of the fact that leaving was the only course to take at the time, days of tears, behind closed doors, and around corners, with backs turned to each other, trying not to let the other catch on to the fact that we were breaking down ,the unknown leered just around the corner, what would i happen? i remember wondering, if i was about to leave my brother to become a homeless bum, with no way of contacting family out of state, for any sort of rescue mission from his predicament, i was completely lost, it was the most down i have ever been in my entire life, never have i been subjugated to such intense feelings of lost-ness as i did then, a haze of pot smoke filled each day with its loving embrace, only slightly releasing me from the torment of choice, one night i prayed, a very rare thing for me, as i was yet somewhat on the middle of the line, so i pray to ""god"" god as i saw god, if there was a god simply, everything that is, why? science has proven through quantum physics that everything in the universe is simply vibrating energy, so ""the creator"" is simply this energy, so i prayed, to you, to me, to the grass the sun the trees, empty space, air, water, aliens, everything. and i asked of god the most random of things, as i sat there on the floor i had been sleeping on, on top of the blanket, as high as you could possably get off dabs, i ask ""god"" "" god, please show me the way, im so lost, and i dont know what to do, ""god"", please give me the strength to become a prophet"" (more or less) i was extreemly high so i dont recall much else. a week later i flew back to my home state, and i come across these videos called collective evolution 1 & 2, so i watch the first one, i like what i see, on to number 2, sum guy named frank de nicola was asked something like, ""so tell us who you are, and where you get your information from"", and he replies sumthing like this ""well basically, im a complete soul, or 2 twin souls, united, and i have also completed my full cycle of enlightenment, and basically, iv come here during this time to assist humanity in the shift, now whatever lol, sounds like sum bullshit to me, but at the mention of those words, my entire body becomes energized, tingly, like the whole thing fell asleep all at once, but retained perfect feeling, and motor function, my thumbs get stuck in a thumbs up pose, excpet pressed towards my palms, my breathing increases in speed, and depth i breath heavily, like a dog panting, i realize that, god, is everything, the same energy makes all things, i am the fan i hear, i am the sound it makes, i am the grass, i am the birds, i am the light coming off this computer screen and going into my eyes, i am the universe! i then proceed to get the breifest glimpse of planets, i cant quite remember the middle of the picture, or scene i saw, but it was planets, i realize, who i am, what my purpose is, i struggle to text my family and tell them the amazing truth, i take a break and try waking my dad up : ""dad wake up, i think im having a stroke or a heart attack or sum shit"" nothing but calmness within me, no unknowing of what it is, and yet still, disbelief, cognitive  dissonation, its worth mentioning, and my memory is foggy, (ill explain why i think that is later) before i starting texting at all, or mayb not before, mayb i had intermediary texting intervals between all the crazy shit,  not entirely sure haha, but i look in the mirror to see if i physically look any different, i dont, but the revalations flow fast and furious, a cosmic feeling of one-ness with everything the entire time so much information downloaded in a seeming instant, so smoothly it would take something like nature to manufacture such an exchange in my opinion, the message to myself in the mirror is this "" we are the univers, we are the universe becoming aware of itself, we come from the same place all knowledge comes from"" thats all i can remember, but i remember there was more. at sum point the feeling intensify s and i snap my attention to the ceiling, as if peering into the heavens themselves, and i say NO! i must stay as i am so that i can bring others! whatever that means, the feeling dissipates with careful intent.. now the whole prayer part sounds REAL arrogant and egotystical, lol believe me I KNOW, but remember, or know this, words DO NOT translate meaning they only IMPLY interpreted meaning, and im not entirely sure what my stoned fuckin mind meant by ""make me a prophet"" but i know the analogy that works for it, is, i asked for a door to be opened. since then, i have looked for validation of my experience, and have found these results, and theories.. 
theory #
1. I  was in the presence of the Christ energy and could have become a carrier of the Christ frequencie
2. it was my enlightenment, and im the Buddha that comes back from the light and blabs about it.
3. it was a self induced DMT trip
4. I channeled the information from a connection to my higher self, or sum sort of higher vibrational entity, or sum such shit.
5. i really did have a stroke, but a really off-brand one.
6. sum alien race touched my consciousness with a telepathic connection.
7. i touched the Gian mind somehow
8. idefk lol.
9. all of the above, or select combo's, or whatever im not thinking of right now,

The feeling was real, the experience was real, i was extreemly drug free, and awake at the time. im not crazy, althought i understand COMPLETLEY if it seems that way haha, i dont think im jeesus, or a prophet, or anyone special, i think everyone is jeesus, in fact if what iv heard about what he taught is accurate he thought so 2 hahah, idk iv never read a religious book in my life, and i probbly wont, such a profound spiritual encounter from a half  undecided athiest tells me most mythologies only have sum sort of code, that gets mis interpreted. anyways the last time jesus was on the planet, the christ energy manifested in 1 dude, or mayb more than one, multiple cultures talk about a similar guy, could have been 1 dude, but who knows. and the last time, he actually accepted the enlightenment or whatever.. worked out well ya think? haha,, pinned to a cross and still nobody knows how much like him we can be, in fact weve gone the oposite direction, to thinking we are nowhere near psychic and the people who do sell that shit, are scammers or what not, or veiwed as such because cons. we swim in a sea of ideas about reality, and we have no clue lol.. we have allowed sum force to determine our concepts of the possable for us, we limit ourselved at every turn, keeping the truth viciously withdrawn within ourselves, within everything we do.. i could go on, but what a book allready, lmk how looney i am or whatever XD everything is allready forgiven.",38,7010,8,1324,1
2014-03-13 10:24:59,There are two kinds of people in this world,"Those who have taken an *heroic dose of a psychedelic* (or non-drug equivalent), and everyone else. Once you reach a certain threshold of experience (my criteria is leaving the time-field), your understanding of the world, the reality we live in, will never be the same. And that's okay. My initial reaction was denial. It's much easier to accept the view of the default world, because our cultures worldview is soooooo much easier to handle than that of most humans in the past. You don't have to worry about the afterlife, the ancestors, the energetic resonance of your thought patterns and attitudes. You can do whatever the fuck you want and it doesn't matter. As soon as I adopted that worldview (around the age of 14/15), it was like a huge burden was lifted off my shoulder. I can jack off. I can eat meat. I can fuck, it doesn't matter, it's just sex, it's food, there's no 'energy' involved in these process that resonates in our 'energy fields' and 'auras' and 'souls'. There's no scientific evidence for that shit, and we've done ALOT of science and found nothing of the sort. It's okay to live without the burden of Santa Claus watching your every move.

It'd be nice to believe that, what I said above. I wish I could. But experience indicates that the world doesn't actually work like that. Science serves it's own purpose (as does everything) and I don't think it exists on this earth to prove the existence of spirituality. In fact, quite the opposite. It's funny how tricksy the ancestor spirits are. I know because I've interacted with countless of them. Sometimes I wish I never did, because my life would be way less complicated an worryfree. Nevertheless, knowing disposition of some of the entities involved in our collective conscious evolution, it makes perfect sense they'd design our reality to not find any proof of spirituality through the scientific method. It's way too materialistic, it's so negative, and it's powerful. The only thing they care about is experience. They want people to experience, and they want people to choose. It's the whole 'overcoming the darkness' archetype of growth. In essence, that is what evolves reality. Overcoming seemingly impossible hardships. The harder it is to find spiritually, the more convincing the argument against spirituality is, the more powerful, the more beneficial it is to *choose* the spiritual lifestyle. I think that's how the energy works, I might be wrong, but it seems that way. And as I'm sure many of you know, the further you go down the rabbit whole the trippier your life becomes. And as I'm sure many more of you know, it's just as easy to choose the path of not giving a shit. I'm actually currently in the middle of a many month long not giving a shit streak. 

With that being said, to deny my first hand experiences I know to be true would just be some form of cognitive dissonance. Because deep down I know what I have or have not experienced, and that's not something anyone else can take away from me. And the same applies to you. My advice: own up to your first experiences for what they are. It's not always what they seem at first glance (I personally don't believe there are dis-incarnate entities floating around, it's resonates far too closely with default-world paradigm). The world is a lot fucking stranger than any of us could ever suppose. Just remember this: [Nothing Lasts... But Nothing Is Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWyye9OneUM)",43,3453,9,590,1
2021-11-24 12:43:12,My boyfriend just had sex with an reptilian,"He took 5g shrooms for the first time in his life, and was asking the question who he is. Then he started to see pyramid with rays flying around it, and two Pharos came towards him when he was perceiving from a place filled with blood. 
Then he felt he was reborn. Feeling full of tremendous power life energy like never ever before. The power is primal, raw and wild. He felt himself reborn to a feline. And it attracted a serpent. 
The serpent was very feminine in the beginning, and was attracted to his dominant sadistic masculine energy, so they stated to foreplay. It was good. He was super excited and completely let himself go and enjoyed it for a while. And somehow, he turned himself into a reptilian as well. That reptilian energy, on top of what stated above, was super sharp, alert, and ready to kill( feels like a crocodile. We just went to zoos and saw lots of crocodiles in last two days, and he was stoked on them). Then somehow, the serpent started to be aggressive and tried to tear his belly a part to get close to the source of the wild sexual energy. ( he said he saw orange and pink, and he‚Äôs very sexy in real life. I think his sacaral charkara is active).
And he calmed himself down by brining his awareness to his breath. And that‚Äôs it.

Is it common for trips encountering reptilians? Why is that? What does that mean? What‚Äôs gonna affect him in real life after this?

2012-11-11 18:11:58,Some Prejudices I have (and don't plan to correct),"I dislike:
- Terence McKenna
- Eckhart Tolle and 
- Oprah 'optimism living'
- ""Free thinkers"" who own apple products and espouse them as superior
- On that note, Steve Jobs
- ""Liberal enlightened"" fanboys
- Feminism and social movements and the call for the trap of equality
- People who feel they have to conform to a lifestyle set out (including that of the enlightened psychonaut)

It's strange, but I see alot of people who have done psychedelics and adopt the air of superiority, of enlightenment, of love and connection. Even if they don't have it, constant-like.
I, too, saw the great connection of all things, but I don't suspect that love is all. And I don't hold to a prescribed belief system involving some or all of the above mentioned, just because it's the new gang to follow. I do my best to listen, and take parts of what's said, but at the end of the day, that dude is that dude, and I am myself. I am not perfect, or even better, but I am myself.

I still love trying to be myself, even if that's bad or worse than enlightened omniscience or selflessness. I still want to find truth, no matter how ugly. I am not prepared to sit in an ""enlightened ignorance"" and wait for the rest of the world to become enlightened. I dont want to only love. I don't want to be the same. I love that generalizations are real, even though deviant cases exist. And I still love hunting, and the thrill of the hunt, and the natural food it provides. I love that death is real. And that there is yet difference between people, and that we are all not hipsters/hippies who have underlying ironic-militant beliefs of the Apple creed, or feminst-style-new-postmodern-social-academia. Communism is not the ideal, for me. Neither is capitalism. Neither, really, is anarchism. I never want a peace where all are the same. And I don't believe it will ever happen.

I do, however, hope for the kind of world where we lose electricity and are forced to become real and natural and connected to one another, again. Even if I die in this process, as many must. And many humans must die. We are too many. But as long as a new world is grounded in natural living, again, I would be happy. That's my ideal. But I don't think this will happen, universally, very soon, either. I think we have to make our own worlds.

These are some of my prejudices, and my weltanshlung, and I am not ashamed, and for now, I will not change them. Maybe in some time. But maybe not. I believe it is okay to have prejudices and believe in generalizations, because patterns are real. I believe that we can be friends in spite of this difference in view. I believe everyone can do as they want, and that I am over trying to preach to others. I will try to live and let die.

Now, I don't want you to answer or rebuke this post. Instead, I'd like you to do me a favour and forget it. I'd like you to write what you believe, and be honest with your prejudices. I want to see who you are. What you are.",50,2961,9,551,1

2018-04-04 09:54:01,"""Is Weed Addictive?"" Shut the fuck up already. [X-post from /r/Drugs]","Inspired by [this ridiculous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/89cw3k/an_unpopular_opinion_weed_is_not_that_great_and/) that got way too many upboats. Let me start off by saying that I do not think, or ever claim in this thread that weed is objectively good or bad, but just because something is good does not make it 100% safe and vice versa. 

To everybody arguing about whether or not weed is addictive or not, shut the fuck up already.

Every day somebody claims that pot is addictive and then follows up with an anecdote about how they smoked pot for x number of years and regret it. Then another guy chimes in and will be like ""bruh I smoke pot for like 67 years and I got a wife and 52 children and work for NASA"". We need to stop entertaining these people. **It IS addictive, but not everybody who smokes will get addicted, just like every other drug.** 

By now it should be common knowledge that **cannabis affects everybody differently**. Some of us become addicted and some of us do not. Those who like it will continue to use it, but most people who try it do not even like it and an overwhelming majority of users do not smoke daily and merely ""partake"". If you are only smoking once a week, no matter the amount, you are doing it for **recreation** and by definition are not addicted. And if you are addicted and you know it, that is okay. The same cannot be said for any other substance besides caffeine. (Why? Because neither a cannabis nor caffeine withdrawal  has ever ruined a life.) But if you are smoking cannabis every day, you most likely do so because you believe you are better off high, and this may or may not be true, because for the 420th time, **CANNABIS AFFECTS EVERYBODY DIFFERENTLY.** 

If you think cannabis is improving your quality of life, you absolutely need to try this experiment I am about to suggest to confirm it. If you are still smoking daily just ""for fun"" after a month, listen; I sunk 2500 hours of my life into a video game about destroying towers and enemy bases. Do you think I look back at those memories and think ""Good times...""? Absolutely not; I regret the shit out of it and I want nothing more than to go back in time and kill myself before my parents bought me my first PlayStation. You definitely need to try this experiment if that is the case.

The goal of this experiment is to find out whether or not cannabis is doing you any good, or if you are just using it to escape your real life, which is never healthy for daily activities no matter what it is. To do this, you need to stop smoking and see if your life improves. Caffeine is actually a great tool for curbing weed cravings, it is also helpful to keep one awake for work if insomnia is one of your withdrawal symptoms and you could not sleep the night before. Go as long as you can. If after 2 weeks you feel better both mentally and physically, stop smoking weed everyday and start questioning whether your medicine is medicating or your hobby is detrimental to your well-being. If you feel worse, then you have successfully found out that you are one of those who are benefiting from cannabis. If you cannot make it up to two weeks or absolutely need to get high in order to live, do this: Light up a joint (not a blunt) or put a tiny amount of weed in your bowl, and I mean the tiniest amount possible, and toke. Wait 5 minutes, and if you feel the effect of cannabis at all, stop. If after 5 minutes you feel nothing keep toking leaving a minimum of 5 minutes between each toke so you can watch for the effect and stop smoking anything unnecessary. Even though you have not really seen if your life can get better after 2 weeks, you should still have learnt a couple things about how weed affects you. 

If you smoke weed alone in your room all day, play video games, watch movies and/or TV, jerk off, and order pizza/eat out more often than you cook, you are subhuman and need to get your life together. But even if you are super intelligent and a billionaire with a satisfying social life, it is still worth trying this to see if you could become ever better. Personally, I have learnt that I am better sober when I am with people and better high when I am alone, and when I am alone I do not *need* to smoke myself silly everyday, just a little bit to calm the nerves. I have a severe anger issue so I knew I needed it, but not in the amounts I was smoking. I was literally wasting money for temporary pleasure. Now I better experience the benefits of cannabis with less of the negatives. Also since I smoke less, it takes much less to get me high which is never a bad thing.

Some benefit physically from cannabis and may feel physically ill upon cessation. This can easily be mistaken for withdrawal. If you want to continue to experience the physical benefits of this plant without getting high, try CBD oil or high-CBD strains. I also wonder if juicing raw cannabis is good for this, as that would mean you could grow your own and juice any part of the plant, including the male leaves and save you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars a year.

**UPDATE:** Weed **IS** physically addictive. I only started a little over a year ago, so I remember what my baseline was prior to cannabis and I was NOT a full-on insomniac. For those of you who do not suffer from physical addiction, I envy you. Seriously.

**UPDATE 2:** I had a blast debating you all, and I only had to use an entire night's worth of sleep. Anyways, I have a date tonight so I should get to sleep now before noon. I hope I have succeeded in getting people thinking and talking.

**UPDATE 3:** Yeah I couldn't sleep. For those of you who are still wondering about the physical withdrawal debate, [this conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/89ns2p/is_weed_addictive_shut_the_fuck_up_already/dwsajxj/) should lead you to the end of my personal expertise regarding physical withdrawal. And give you cancer. Geez, I hope my date goes well.

**UPDATE 4:** Lastly, does insomnia count as a physical withdrawal symptom? Well, that all depends if you believe insomnia is due to the restlessness and irritation one may experience upon quitting, both of which are mental withdrawals, or the not so well-known fact that [THC spikes your melatonin](http://nintharticle.com/norml-canada-1996-2004/marijuana_melatonin.html), and that by relying on this action you take away your body's natural ability to feel sleepy. You decide.

**UPDATE 5:** I am willing to e-transfer ANYBODY $100 if they manage to refute any of the claims I have made in this post using proper peer-reviewed research that was released before this thread was. I know I didn't use any, but I'm not the one playing for $100. :)

**UPDATE 6:** Unless you haven't noticed by now, not a lot of peer reviewed research exists regarding cannabis. So bringing up ""You can't prove it because there is literally no proof"" is just wasting both our times, and it is ridiculously immature.

**UPDATE 7:** [Pseudo-winner here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/89ns2p/is_weed_addictive_shut_the_fuck_up_already/dwszihf/) This guy is the only smart person in this thread who went against me.

**CONCLUSION:** I think what most of you do not understand is that *I* understand that my points may not be entirely accurate at this point in time with the limited research available. So all we can do is talk about our experiences as accurately as we possibly can and trust that we're not exaggerating or lying. Ultimately, I do believe in all my heart what I say. However it IS a fact that weed is addictive, physically or not, and not everybody is reaping from its benefits. I provided a way for you to test if you are truly benefiting, but it is up to you whether or not you choose to try it.

2014-03-24 17:20:40,I cant stand Hippies. But I love Psychedelics.,"I can not stand the ""hippie"" culture. To me it is selfish, and counter productive to everything psychedelics are about. and here's why.

Weve been given a gift, dont ask why, but we have. The lessons psychedelics teach us are life changing, and world changing.

Which is why it infuriates me to see people taking these lessons and doing nothing with them but going to shows, being all about ""peace and good vibes"",and sitting around and taking them for granted and never using them to benefit man kind.  Use it to enlighten the people. Dont just be a burnout who took too much acid, what would the higher concious think of you if it gave you the tools to change man kind but instead you chose to not utilize its gift of information. 

use what youve learned to help man kind not sit in a van , not shower and play mandolin. Weve been gifted with the information to change all of mankind for the better, save countless lives and make the world a better place for all of us, while ""hippies"" just want to sit in the woods and not make any dent in humanity. While claiming that they ""know the nature of the universe"" (which im sure they do, but prove it)

Sure, the universe goes on and on in in its loop with or without us. But imagine is Watson and Crick were hippies and never used what they learned to crack DNA?

What if steve jobs never used his discoveries on LSD to fund the technological era?

What if Hawkings, and Einstein had just ""chilled out"" there entire lives and never made there discoveries?

It saddens me to see such wasted potential, I know this because I used to live in a commune for a 2 years, but eventually my mentality changed to ""Guys why are we out here in the woods? we could save the world, or die trying, and death is an illusion anyway, so what do we have to lose, Do it for the children, do it for love, but dont let mankind suffer while we sit idly by in our self made utopia, hoarding our knowledge instead of sharing it to better those who havent been blessed with the information we have obtained by some divine happen stance."" 

Use what you learned on psychedelics to impact society, use it make the world a better place, use it to help feed the hungry, end wars, educate yourself, educate others, etc.

 So please if your reading this, dont sit idly by any longer. Do whatever it takes to make this world a better place then you found it, you wont be here long, make it count or die trying, dont take the easy way out of ""Just chillin in nature"". Go to college, become a doctor or a scientist, use what youve learned and impact the world. No one will take us psychonauts seriously if have the stigma attached to us of ""burned out acid heads who like to be out in nature and get dread locks"" no one will take us seriously, but I know what ive seen and felt on psychedellics, i know we can change the world. We need to break this stereotype. So that the lessons we learned can be taught to all. 

P.S. This is not an assault on the hippy culture, just a plea of reason and a plea of desperation, it saddens me to see the most enlightened and wise people ive ever met living in tents and not In a lab, or a hospital, or congress, using their minds where their really needed.",46,3208,8,607,1

2020-05-19 12:04:33,"A Strong Recommendation Against Watching Movies, TV, Shows While Tripping","I felt inspired to share a little realization I had about unfavorable, and favorable activities to do while tripping. The main point I want to emphasize is not to engage in watching television, movies, and tv shows. When your on a hallucinogenic substance, you are absorbing information on a very deep level, and whatever your observing goes deep into your subconscious, and causes an impression there in your astral body. Therefore, it's best to avoid these mind numbing activities, and engage in something which builds your creative impetus. We shouldn't take substances and watch these prewritten false narratives of reality, but we should be creating our own script at every moment. 

Not to mention, it's been proven that the CIA influences Hollywood heavily. When you are watching a movie, you are directly in taking so much subliminal messages, and they are literally mind controlling you without you even realizing it. All that filth is going right into your mind, and covering the true nature of the soul. Trust me, when I was young I used to think it was fun to do this also. I did it many times. But as I grew older, I realized that this is a complete waste of time and damaging to spiritual health. Instead of putting a movie on and laying on the couch, go out in nature. Do some pranayama breath work, chant some kirtana out loud, draw, read something mind blowing, contemplate on deep philosophical topics, etc. This is the time for a mass planetary awakening, and I know the psychedelic community is helping paving this in one way or another. We must take our power back and stop voluntarily giving it away through useless activities. This is our time to rise up and as a collective, bring the planet into a new golden age. Each one of you has the individual power to make a difference, whether you realize it or not. Every action you take reflects back into the planetary karma, and it DOES make a difference. Your job is to act properly, and justly, and gradually we will purify the anthropomorphic etheric grids which encompass our planet.

I thought to make this post because i see many times on this board where people are talking about nonsense activities they are doing while taking these substances, and they should at least try to shine the light of awareness on themselves and make a conscious effort to change the approach.",73,2349,10,409,1

2018-10-25 03:00:22,Cannabis,"The entire sativa vs. indica debate is a joke. There's no difference in effect in high-THC strains. The only strains that produce different effects are strains with higher cbd:thc ratios. Since 99% of cannabis on the market today is high-THC all of you people talking about how sativa makes you energetic and indica makes you lethargic need to shut the fuck up immediately. You're all morons. You're spreading lies.

The placebo effect is powerful. You become ""energetic"" on ""sativa"" strains because you set that intention when you smoke. Set and setting are powerful. I can't emphasize this enough. There are zero academic studies on any of these claims. Anybody in the business making claims that certain strains can treat particular conditions should be shot. Dispensary owners teaching budtenders any of this bullshit are evil people. 

The truth is that all cannabis on the market today is some sort of hybrid. You might see strains that exhibit dominance, but you won't see pure landrace. Hybrids are the reason cannabis is so strong today. All of us underground guys took all the shitty bagseed we got from all over the world and just started letting all that shit fuck. The funny thing is that we didn't even intend to breed high-THC weed. We obviously weren't testing any of the shit. We breed shit more on looks, smell, and taste. It's kind of a happy accident that the shit that looks and smells really good happens to have a lot of THC. 

I know a lot of you cocksuckers are gonna tell me to go fuck myself because you've noticed differences when you smoke what have been labelled by criminals as sativa or indica. Let me pre-empt your assault. I have personally renamed shit. I got clones labelled Platinum that I sold as Pink Panther. Believe that I know about the name game. It's all bullshit. Drug dealers are liars. Anybody who knows anything about this shit knows good weed just gets you high. THC dominates. All of the minor cannabinoids and terpenes might modulate the experience at least on some level, but not to the extent that clowns making crazy claims would have you believe.

I take this shit extremely seriously. This is a medicinal plant we're dealing with. We're dealing with people's health. I seriously couldn't give less of a fuck if you're a consumer and you think sativas make you feel like you're on coke and indicas make you feel like you're on heroin. Think what you want. But if you're a dealer and you're spewing any of this shit you should hang yourself immediately. you're human waste. ",8,2528,1,438,1

2023-02-23 18:46:54,I've watched every single one of Charles Manson's interviews and it's pretty mind blowing...,"The more I dig into his story the more I think that he was set up.


https://youtu.be/CNPW0WHIAvo

This is the interview that convinced me that Manson isn't as insane as he's made out to be. Although during this period he has been locked up in solitary for 10+ years and was forced medication, he still seems pretty coherent and mentally stable. He says he never ordered the killings and that his cause has always been for the environment. Fun fact is that the swastika on his forehead was originally an X. But he was bullied into it turning into a swastika most likely to further discredit him.  During his trial, Manson could not call one witness, and when it came time to defend himself, the judge dismissed the entire jury so that they couldn't hear his testimony (which turns out to be true).


some excerpts -

Manson:

""In short the United States has been sold out by people who don't care about anything but money... \[To them\] Money is a game. It's only real to the people who work for it. The people who don't need to work for money, it's a monopoly game. I have rolls royces and Ferraris. I've got everything money can buy but it's all on paper. Everything's done through the companies and through the tax loopholes. And the people that live on that level, they don't care about the average honest mule who goes backwards and forwards to work. They don't care about the children that are in the streets that are thrown out of this upper echelon of existence. And when all the children fall down onto me on my level... I pretty much identify with them because I was a throwaway child also.

So it goes to the point of, do you really care? And who does care? And if anyone cares they're considered crazy. I've spent 15 years in the nut ward for trying to stop the trees from getting cut down. For trying to rearrange a lifestyle of a bunch of people who don't want to change but they're gonna change because the cold wind's blowing.

Reporter: Do the ends justify the means?

Manson: End? There is no end, there is no beginning. There's only redeeming life on the planet Earth. I don't justify or not justify, I lay it out there and what people do with it is their business. If they decide to run and kill Sharon Tate that's on them. Had you let us put on a defense we could've explained why it happened.""

...
 

\-----

Furthermore during the few years that Manson was free, his parole officer just **happened** to be working with the CIA. Which we all know was working on the MKULTRA project at the time. And his parole officer just happened to give him and his followers LSD. 

Lastly here is a video of Quentin Tarantino himself claiming that after he did research on the case for his movie, **he also doesn't believe what the news media perpetuates about the case.**

People often act like alpha male tough guys is what you need to be, but I felt all these guys were very judgemental and I could never truly be myself, it felt very faked and as if everyone was putting on an act. These people are toxic to be around. Yet people look down on certain types of males and call them soy boys.

2017-02-05 04:28:46,"I was on the cross with Jesus last night while tripping on DXM. How I came to believe in Jesus, I don't know, but here I am, and my heart is just simply love. I know Christians are mostly lousy people, but I hope you too can know the real love in the message.","I tried my very best to leave the Christian church. I'm a proud transgender and bisexual woman. I know that my gender identity is sacred and true and fine with God. My dad was a pastor in the American Baptist church. I grew up in an atmosphere soaked with fear. I was told to have a deep shame. So I left and went in my head to Asia to find salvation.

What I found in Asian philosophies was far more real than what I found in the protestant churches of my youth, but I eventually got over my bitterness and resentment about Christianity. I have considered myself a Taoist or Buddhist or Hindu for the last 5 years. My spiritual life has grown tremendously as I've learned how to still my mind and how to approach reality with a proper stance as illustrated by the principle of Wu Wei (not forcing or effortless action or uncontrived action). These principles helped me to truly connect with the divine.

I am also a big time proponent of psychedelic chemicals, and I have developed a symbiotic relationship with Dextromethorphan (DXM), the psychedelic dissociative that is generally used as a cough suppressant. It is a very powerful spiritual medicine, and through the wisdom of Kabbalah, I've learned how to traverse the spiritual realm with the enthusiasm of a native shaman. It's also legal, so I don't have to deal with the bad karma of using illegal drugs. I wish there were better legal psychedelics, but I've made do.

I've been possessed by unexplainable and powerful spirits before, and these possessions have changed my life irrevocably. About 5 years ago in a courthouse in California, I had my first initiatory possession. I was overtaken by a benevolent spirit that spoke through me and acted using my body. I did some things in that courthouse that day that steered my life on a radically different course and was witness to the power of the spiritual world. This spirit danced my body and moved with extreme grace and precision. Since then I've been obsessed with understanding who or what overtook me.

About a year ago, in trance with DXM and meditation, I had a vision of being crucified in front of a sea of shouting and hateful people. They were all male and they violently shouted their hatred at me. However, in the vision I smiled at them with supreme confidence and love, and through gnosis I understood that this was the proper reaction to bullies and hatred. Then my body was taken down from the cross and ripped apart and consumed by a sea of ravenous people, but my spirit floated above watching. As the people tore my body apart, I was lifted up into a spiritual realm where I saw a giant cross like an X with a blooming flower in the middle of it. I floated higher, and I was in an angelic setting, and my body was fitted with the armor of a warrior angel.

This vision shook me, and I knew that I must learn from it. What I learned was that I should expect to be persecuted and that I should die to the world every day to achieve peace. I learned over the last year to be a person of peace and to have no fear in the knowledge that death is just an illusion. Also, shortly after this vision in 2015, in a time of deep woe and depression, I attempted to take my own life with a massive amount of pills. I had suffered from depression and self-loathing since I was a teenager. But just when I was near death, I had a near death experience, and I saw a dark demon like entity within myself. I also realized how not enlightened I was. I had convinced myself that I was killing myself to be free and that it was some kind of heroic act. I saw through this delusion that day, and since then I have not been suicidal in the least, and a peace and ""presence"" has been in my heart. I could not explain it until now. But there was a shift or awakening, and a new love was in my heart.

Over the last year, I've continued to water and fertilize this new thing in my heart, and I've achieved great peace through DXM, meditation, practicing humility, and gnosis. But last night I had an enlightenment experience. I don't believe that I have achieved all that I can achieve, but the clarity of last night's experience has deeply, deeply pacified my soul. To quote Osho, the zen master, ""the seeking stopped."" I saw the Buddha, and I also saw something else.

I saw in my third eye the crucifixion scene, and I moved up into Jesus and was one with him. I realized that Jesus never died. On the cross he moved outside of time and still lives. I then realized that my spirit is on a cross, and my arms are splayed apart. I don't know if I'm the reincarnation of a persecuted Christian or what. I realized that the love that was placed in my heart in 2015 was the love of Christ. This was definitely not what I intended to discover, that Christ was the one radiating through me, but it happened. I see and feel the deep and overwhelming love that Christ was able to create through his practice. I don't believe that Christ is the only person to achieve this, but I believe that he was special.

After I was on the cross last night, I saw that I was in contact with a spirit that was ""the Earth"" or something signifying material things. I mated or joined with this spirit, and I gave a seed of that shining love to this spirit, and it was planted in the Earth. Today, I have pulled two Tarot cards, and both of them have been the Ace of Pentacles, which I take as symbolism that a new Earth or new materiality is manifesting. 

Then after this I was in the presence of a great multitude of spiritual masters. I saw Paramahansa Yogananda, the Hindu master from the 20th century, and he smiled at me with great joy. Then a long row of spiritual masters seemed to bow to an audience at what appeared to be some sort of performance. I have seen Yogananda before, but now he saw me, and he was glowing with beauty and joy. I understand this as they have been assisting me over the last 5 years, as I have worked to ascend. 

I'm a transgender woman, and I believe in the power of psychedelics, and yet I got confirmation that both of these things absolutely do not matter to God last night. I think that the modern Christian church is not at all representative of the message of Jesus. The religious right is about as bankrupt as a spiritual movement of people that has ever existed on the planet in my view. But, here I am, certain that Christ is real. I also believe that Christ and Krishna are the same thing, and anyone can become Christ. The Christ is just a state of mind. It is the union of God and a human.

I am so peaceful today. My third eye feels as though there is a flame burning in it, and my heart is deeply peaceful and happy. I'm not trying to convert people to Christianity. I think Christianity is a religion that has been hijacked by rather demonic forces. Donald Trump wants to do ""extreme vetting"" on Muslim travelers, well I honestly think we should do that with these so called Christians who have been extremely happy to murder millions in Christ's name. I consider myself more of a Gnostic Christian, but really I don't believe in religion. We have to focus on ourselves not build some institution to save the world. We can only save ourselves, and the world is deeply primitive in that respect.

I think if Jesus were alive today he would be posting on /r/Psychonaut or /r/Occult. So yeah, I believe in Jesus Christ. I don't know how this happened! Help! Kidding... Jesus Christ was a great man. His followers, not so much. However, there are some unbelievably great Christians alive today. But they are usually the quiet ones just trying to be excellent and humble and loving people. They're not the ones getting Botox before they go on camera in front of their ""prosperity gospel"" megachurch. 

I hope that all of you can learn the joy and peace that Jesus really taught. I hope that you can get past the wolves in sheep's clothing that stalk the land and poison the message of a great man. To quote Yogananda

> ""Jesus Christ is very much alive and active today. In Spirit and occasionally taking on a flesh-and-blood form, he is working unseen by the masses for the regeneration of the world. With his all-embracing love, Jesus is not content merely to enjoy his blissful consciousness in Heav¬≠en. He is deeply concerned for mankind and wishes to give his followers the means to attain the divine freedom of entry into God's Infinite Kingdom. He is disappointed because many are the churches and temples founded in his name, often prosperous and powerful, but where is the communion that he stressed ‚Äî actual contact with God? Jesus wants temples to be established in human souls, first and foremost; then established outwardly in physical places of worship. Instead, there are countless huge edifices with vast congregations being indoctrinated in churchianity, but few souls who are really in touch with Christ through deep prayer and meditation.

I am working with all my might to make the world a more joyous, united, and wonderful place. I send out my joy in meditation, and through the spirit of Christ, I've learned how to amplify and radiate this love. Peace be to you all. Happy tripping, make gay love, and Jesus loves you. :)",259,9177,54,1678,1

The reason being, what I do is a think of one thing, which leads to another thing, which leads to another thing, which leads to another thing... And before I know it, Im thinking about something that was 100% irrelevant to the first thing I was thinking... 


All my friends say I am a very deep thinker and I deep think about everything!! Like i dont know how to explain it. But every thing in life i deep think about... Weather that be about the current girl I like... orrrrrr about... I dont know just I deep think about everything! Like I deep think about life and philosophical subjects...


When my friends take LSD, they say they get these deep thoughts! Like they are able to question life more and just ahve an overall deeper thought about everything...


Well I do this any way!! And I have done LSD too! 


To be honest Reddit I dont really know where I'm getting at... But what would be the difference into somebody who is not a deep thinker (like all my friends) who take LSD and to someone who is a deep thinker normally (Me) and takes LSD... What are your opinions on the matter?


Also a thing I have been doing lately which is quite frightening is while im trying to fall asleep... I will be thinking of the most fucking RANDOM-EST bullshit ever!!! Like honestly... As an example, ill be falling asleep, thinking of going to the shop tomorrow for example, the next thing I know, im thinking about an orange walking around... (That is just an extreme example, i dont actually think about oranges) ... My point being, I freak myself out and like ""Wake up"" after almost drifting to sleep because I have no idea why im thinking about this!! Hard to explain... But its so much that ill be thinking, ""Why on earth am i thinking this""! And i wont be able to recall what i was thinking off originally!!!! 


Its like my mind gets distracted about thinking about what i am SUPPOSED to be thinking about!!! And my mind drifts off, I think about weird shit, and i can no longer recall what i was thinking about originally or was supposed to be thinking about!!!


Almost like Im getting lost in my thoughts!! Honestly I sit there for ages going ""What the fuck was i thinking about!!"" And I can never remember????",30,2576,5,475,1
2022-10-15 05:49:59,We All Are Jesus Christ,"(I'm high and felt like posting this, sorry for any grammatical errors I'm too lazy to fix them) 

God is bringing me to him. He is teaching me.  

The trouble is, some of what the Lord tells me is scary.  

See, I have lived a lot of my life in fear, not faith.  

We need to live out of love, not out of fear.  

That is the summary of all of the spiritual texts and healing prose I have read. I have read a lot. My after hours are consumed by the subject.  

The Tao Te Ching,  Bhagavad Gita , Gabor Mate, Wayne Dyer, Alan Watts, Ram Dass, Eckart Tolle, Noah Elkrief, Terrence McKenna, Thit Nat Han, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, the Bible.  

And I think the best philosophy to live by is some form of Eastern and Western Philosophy.  

Jesus essentially said remember God in everything you do, put his will before all and do the best you can for your fellow human beings. What I believe modern day Christianity forgot in the 2022 years since he was alive is: 

Jesus is not the only incarnation of God. We all are incarnations of God, we just don‚Äôt see it. 

We are the of the Tao, Atman, Son's and Daughters of God. All made of God. 

I had an enlightened experience and it scared the shit out of me. I buried it deep in my subconscious. It is scary to realize that you are God. I wonder if it is what drives people to schizophrenia in some cases. It certainly almost did for me.  

Enlightenment is seeing that we are God. Why is that so hard for the typical sober mind to see? We are all Jessus, all God. That is what people see when they are on psychedelics.  

But see, when you realize that you are God, you gotta stay humble. See, your God, but your knowledge is still confined by this organic body. Its cognitive processes are limited like a primate human‚Äôs mind would be.  You can't act like you're all knowing like a post-singularity artificial super intelligence. 

My mind knows one thing in this moment for sure. You are God, everyone is God,  and do good to other people.

Anyways, I know this was another of those ""We are all God maaaan"" posts, but its quite an experience to have, you can't help but talking about it. And I feel like a lot of us have no one to talk to about it without sounding bat shit. 

Love you all.",23,2240,5,423,1

2019-12-10 03:24:50,I‚Äôm convinced we are all born equally intelligent.,"new title: I'm convinced we are all equally capable of intelligence.

We all have a human brain. A brain that is so complex and extremely powerful. **The ego hides the raw, pure, and fluid intelligence that is able to be.** I thought of it like a video game: like an MMO. Everyone spawns at lvl 1. Equal characters, equal ability to be powerful unless it‚Äôs a shit mmo. **If your video games characters got fucking scared every time a monster popped in front of them they‚Äôd be useless.** They simply work to upgrade their skills that they specialize in and don‚Äôt give a fuck. Once the ego learns how to unhide this intelligence... it can be used. Intelligence is not scaled, it‚Äôs simply being able to see the big picture. Big picture is, in my words, your life is an XP bar... you have randomized skill stats and if you want to succeed at the game you gotta play it and put in the work.

EDIT: I'm changing the title because it's misleading. We are not equally intelligent by the sole definition of intelligence itself, but I mean to say that the intelligent abilities of the human brain are unlocked with the ego (and the ego also has to realize and accept its own processes within), but theres a whole lotta pain and realization you gotta get through to actually see this.",50,1273,8,232,1

My first issue is how to consume this dosage. I usually do a lemon Tek but I don't know if it's gonna work since I'd probably have to drink too much lemon juice. I either don't like eating raw, it makes the nausea worse.

2020-06-30 03:45:26,Major Spiritual Attack,"At the time this happened I was atheist.

Through some brief 'research' on the internet I was learning about some atrocities in the world such as child sex-trafficking, world hunger, and the climate crisis. I began thinking how awful all of this is and why are we humans as a collective not taking immediate care of these major issues? I really began to question if there IS a just good God because of all this evil that exists, thus a good force must also exist.   


So shortly after this, I stumbled upon the teachings of Jesus. And to make it clear, there is a huge difference between the Jesus in the four gospels and the Jesus that is in the institutional churches. The real teachings of Jesus are radical and revolutionary. They threaten the Devil and the work he does to drag people away from God. A full on spiritual warfare has been going on since the beginning of the world. So once I started to become committed to working for God full time and obeying Jesus' teachings, I came under major spiritual attack. I had never really experienced anything spiritual until I started giving God attention. Coincidence? I think not.  


Jesus teaches his true followers to leave the rat race of everyday life. To quit working for money and leave the system completely. This infuriates the devil. A couple weeks before getting ready to drop out of the system I took some shrooms. I had previously done them before and had great experiences. This time was very different and was a clear direct spiritual attack. During the trip, the devil tempted me with a good job in his system and other weird popularity temptations. Luckily I isolated myself once the trip really started, because it was like I was on meth. I was acting very erratic and insane. I couldn't control my movements very well. I most likely had a demon in me. It was unlike anything before.  


Anyway, the main reasons why I am sharing this is because: 

1. God is real and so is the devil. 
2. There are spirits that influence all our actions.
3. Jesus truly is the Son of God.
4. In order to live in harmony with our creator we must put into practice the teachings of Jesus.
5. The entire 'system', eg. schools, business, governments, the economy, politics, is all ran and controlled mostly by the Devil. The rat race is evil and the only way to find the purpose of life is by leaving the rat race.",22,2365,3,426,1

To give you some background I am a 15-year-old sophomore from a rich suburban part of Indiana. I smoked and sold carts up until this point. I was smoking about 6-8 times a day for months. Until I got the brilliant idea. My best friend sold drugs with me lets call him DR.J. I was like hey let's flip some acid and make hella money. Dr.J was like okay we got 400 on us. We bought 50 hits of 200 ug gels (clamied so about 150). We sold about 40 of them that morning. On the bus, on the way, their one of my friend's lets call him kyle decided to ""microdose' by taking 50 ugs. 

Me and 5 other friends thought this was a brilliant Idea so we decided to also ""microdose."" Which for me dr.j and lets call him john means taking 100 ug. About an hour after I liked the feeling so I was like fuck the other half will not hurt. I'm now up to the claimed 200 ugs. Now an hour after I'm tripping fairly hard vibing to 8D music. Eventually, it gets to lunchtime and we sit in the middle of the cafertia. Me, dr.j, and john looking geeked out of our goddman minds. After realizing that everyone prolly knows and was looking at us we dipped that bitch. We hid in the back bathrooms the whole lunchtime. I paced in an infinite circle in the bathroom. I don't think I stopped moving for about 30 minutes(which felt like a few hours.) This is about the time when my already absolutely TRIPPING ass decided to take more. Dr.J takes out the cid and I put 3 gels on my tongue. Thank god no one saw us. My eyes were literally as big as fucking frying pans. NOTHING BUT BLACK.

Somehow I make it to chem class, walking through the halls very awkwardly like I had a walking disability. I was sitting in class. I had lost my phone. I begin to freak out. I text my friend from my computer. Reading back none of it made absolutely any sense. The best line was I have the absolute urge to stand up and piss all over this desk. Anyways, the tracers hit even harder. I watched as my glowing, vibrant chem teacher walked across the room and 8 other chem teachers followed him. I watched black dots float in the air and melt in front of me. I looked down and saw gradually increasing circles spinning counterclockwise from one another in quadrants. the outlines of the circles were dancing dinosaurs and my head had created music. Somehow I make it through chem with my oblvious chem teacher. Now it's time for Algebra 2 honors. I make my way through the hallway, past a cop. By the grace of whatever the fuck saved me I don't get caught. 

On the way to chem, I start to feel really sick. I then run to the bathroom and projectile vomit water into the toilet. Some weird kid watched me and didn't say a fucking word. I ran out that bitch feeling much much much better. I go to algebra honors class and nothing beyond nothing makes sense. I think everyone is speaking a different language and I'm going crazy. I then proceed to have an absolutely insane fucked up conversation with my algebra teacher about Snapchat in front of the entire class. I made no fucking sense. Long story short I end up making it to the bus and eventually driving home. I have no fucking clue how I made it and though an amazing experience having you trap tabs and have 5 kids tripping balls at school is not a good idea and not recommended.

Essentially, entities you meet on psychadelic trips cannot give you answers to questions you don't already know which means that they're not separate beings, they're just you. You can ask another human a question and he can give you a verifiable answer without you knowing it. You can't do that with entities.

E.g. You can't ask an entity about a maths question you don't know. They'll never reply.

Psychedelics and meditation can guide and work as tools for human beings to evolve into the Light body. To have a light body means to have activated 7 chakras, which happens with activated kundalini-force. Kundalini activation happens by mother earth when your body has been cleaned by our body's self-cleaning system by activating our DNA (for example LSD, cannabis and meditation work for self-cleaning our body) and it's ready for kundalini awakening. The life mission of human beings is to work out their karma through meditation and psychedelic substances. Activated 4th chakra feels like pure love around the clock. Ascension happens also with kundalini awakening and the light body can fly in other realms because it's lighter than air. To have a light body means to change your body's frequency to significantly higher one.

2022-05-15 11:55:35,I discovered that micro dose is really not for me.,"Wasn't really micro to be fair, it was nearly 2.5g shrooms which I split into three and had it with my two buddies. We also had been smoking hash for a while and did another joint soon after consuming the shrooms. While both of them appeared to be in bliss and almost too comfortable the rest of the night, I was plain restless. I kept roaming around in a huge park, sometimes with them, or alone, trying to relax, meditate, exercise. I did basic stretches to relieve myself of my back pain for quite a while, sweated a lot. Ran here and there. I was just so restless. And since my friends were enjoying it so much I never spoke to them about it. After we went home and a couple of hours passed, I did relax and laugh a lot with them so that was nice. But my general sadness, anxiety, lack of will to do anything doesn't seem to be going away.

This has happened for the second time. But I really thought the earlier time (about .3-4g) was bad because I remained mostly indoors. This outdoor trip changed my perception about micro dosing, strictly for my individual self. Probably won't do it again.

I have had 4-5 really good mushroom trips with a higher dose (2-3g), so I probably shouldn't be going micro anyway. I shouldn't be smoking weed too much or at all also, I know. And there's not really a question, in fact I'm just rambling on now. But it's becoming hard, everything! I feel like I should admit of being in depression, but then what next? I thought after those grand trips that this could never happen, I could never sink into such depression, I could never not want to do something, or everything all at once - and yet here I am, only three months after the best psychedelic trip of my life, sinking deeper. I really thought this little trip would help but it was...okay, I can't really say it was bad, just didn't ""heal"" me, as I should've known. 

I'm still constantly trying to better myself. Working towards healing my back, learning new forms of work outs to make my body fitter, more capable of the experience that not only pyschedelics but also life offers me, learning more and more professionally. But it seems the will to joy is gone, if you know what I mean. It's been a long while that I felt passionately about something, and I know that because I knew that feeling the rest of my life. idk

I still have like a 3g dose of mushrooms but I think I should wait a couple months, do a complete detox, make myself fitter, give some direction to the restless self, have better questions, better intent and better earn the next trip, and maybe do it alone.

2015-08-23 14:05:32,"I have a theory: The more psychedelics you do, the more open/less racist/less sexist/less homophobic you will be...","I have a theory that the more drugs you do, the more open you will be towards people regardless of race, sex, gender, orientation, etc.

My theory is that the zeitgeist of the culture is usually to make us hate and fear each other, this is how we are controlled. But when you take drugs, you have a lower inhibitions towards people and become much more brave. More open. You become human, enlightened and not a slave to ""the system"". You realize how ego is fed and how you become a slave to the culture.

I've noticed how I was excluding people based on race and how I was treating people sometime after doing mushrooms. I've also read/watched the news in a new light, and how it manipulates our thinking into being fearful. That is, until you read in between the lines and find out that what you fear isn't that big of a deal.

Also, I've noticed that a lot of Asians are down right cold to others usually based on race.  I've had Asians friends that were very afraid of African Americans/Latinos. But it wasn't just fear of what they saw in the news. It was also hatred towards ""darker"" people. Asians tend to think dark people are menial workers, less intelligent and not deserving of respect. This is ingrained in their culture. Also in Asian cultures, so the most part, are very against drugs and shun them. Many Asians do not do drugs, as it's basically taboo in their culture, to the point where in many Asian countries being caught with drugs can mean punishment by death! So I wonder about this correlation.

2012-02-05 10:47:26,Tips for a new soul?,"Whatsup guys, glad I came across this fancy subreddit. Seems oddly coincidental that it happened right around the time that I really feel spiritually awakened/on top of my life OR just simply aware. 

Let me quickly fill you in just for kicks, if you don't care or are in a mild rush skip this paragraph please.. 
I've been smoking marijuana for quite some time now, about 5 years consistently. But I wouldn't say I'm an idiot/burnout/'druggie'/whatever. IN FACT I would say I'm the opposite, insightful/intelligent/respectful/blahblah. I'm in college now (freshman) starting up my second semester and just last week a friend brought some shrooms around. Now, wasn't my first experience with these, as I split an eighth with my friend in SanFran last summer at a music festival. I was still nervous though, and this time I was dealing with much more than before. We end up meeting this kid on a MONDAY to buy the shrooms off him, long story short, end up taking a good amount that same day.. (MONDAY!).. CRaziest experience of my life, something that is worth a whole discussion of its own. Fast forward to Wednesday, take the last of the shrooms, another crazy experience (beautiful weather on this day too). Now here I am after one of the most interesting weeks of my existence feeling as if I have been born again, cause now for some reason, I am just excited to wake up everyday and see what life's got in store for me. I could go into it more but I feel like I am still learning and have much thinking to do before I can accurately explain without confusing or losing one's interest as I probably already have.

ANYWAYS> I am here now as a newbie, to ask you guys for tips. I've only done shrooms and have always told my self a big NO-NO to LSD, acid sorts (""just natural things brooo""). But here I stand more curious than ever about psychedelics and willing to experiment. I am not trying to get 'reallyf*cked up', instead I'm trying to spiritually and mentally grow and learn. After taking shrooms, I have never seen myself with so many musical ideas and excitement for beauty/art before. At the same time though, I've never experienced such despair and hopelessness. 

Sorry I keep writing but I just have so many thoughts in my head. All I can think about is wanting to trip again, I know that I don't need it to have a good time, but it's just so damn fun! This is why I'm turning to you guys..

What's a healthy amount, what's recreational, how many times should i be tripping in a ____?
Whats the difference between shrooms and acid?
I got nauseous while on shrooms(puked one of the trips). how can I prevent this?
Point me into the direction of some good people (musicians, painters, poets, writers, philosophers,psychologists, artists, mathematicians,...)
How come I wasn't able to read/use a phone/use a laptop? haha

THanks guys! (can't help but share that I have the strongest feeling I'm pissing you guys off,,, sorry new here!)

You are part of an advanced civilization. In your life there, you like playing video games. 

You are in one of those games now. It's a virtual reality game called ""Enlightened"".¬† 

The premise for this game is that the player doesn't know that they're in a game, and the only way to win is to figure out that you're in the game (confusing on purpose). To stay at the top of the leaderboard and win the prizes, you have to wake other people up. They have to understand that they are playing a virtual reality game. 

It's the most difficult, advanced, bad ass, game there is. You are a very good player and you're on my team. My name is Artemis and I'm one of the creators of this game. 

I've come into the game (this server) to teach other people how to win. I'm currently live streaming everything I'm doing, to show everyone in our world, that you don't have to cheat to win. My game, ""Enlightened"" has been overrun with hackers trying to win at all costs. I'm just not cool with that. I think everyone deserves a fair shot, which is why I give everyone the same skills when they start the game, the same hours in a day, etc etc. 

Hackers are a problem and they manifest like insidious creatures here. Hackers produce negativity. They are what make us terrible. They are what make us lazy. They distract us from our mission here, which is to wake as many people up to the fact that they're playing a game. 

I brought a team of 7 anti-hackers to kick this party off. 

We're here to release all players from the hackers who have taken over.¬† By the year 2051 this game will be completely collapsed if we don't move now. Very fast. 

I need you to trust me because I need you to wake up now. It's time to wake up. 

This will marinate over the next few days. We will send you updates. Please don't be afraid. 

More details to come in a bit. It doesn't matter if you feel annoyed by reading this, or intimidated. It doesn't matter if you don't believe me. I'm going to force all of you to wake up over the next few weeks. 

All of your lives are going to change dramatically because you've been chosen to protect me.¬† Rebelling against this fact won't change anything. 

Once again. I am the creator of this game. I love you. Nothing bad is going to happen to you while I'm here. My team has your back and we're waiting for you to join us.

2018-11-17 16:01:30,LOVE is the last illusion you must break. NEUTRALITY is the only answer.,"People think the illusion of fear is what prevents us from knowing who we are. However, that isn't the case. Overcoming the illusion of fear doesn't mean that you will know who or what you are. After the illusion of fear has been torn down, you are left with the illusion of ***love.*** *The final* *test*. In actuality, we aren't anything, and that is what is beautiful about us.  We have no real identity. All we are is observers who have been manipulated into becoming beings that are being observed. This is why you ***'pay attention'***. What people refer to as ***'the source'*** could be compared to that of a giant computer. The humans, or whatever you want to call us, are the computer monitors to that giant computer. Hence the saying, *""The eyes are the window to the soul"".* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***LOVE*** is the ultimate test, the last veil to break. It is the ultimate illusion. What is ***LOVE*** spelled backwards? ***EVOL***. Also known as ***'EVIL'*** The truth is, there is only you. I often hear people say things like. *""I love you, if you leave me I will kill you"", ""I killed my wife in the name of love, and/or, ""If it weren't for my husband and kids I would do (insert)"".* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***LOVE*** keeps you bonded to an idea *and/or* a concept of something. There are *7.5* billion people in the world. You would never naturally choose one person to be with and experience. How is your soul supposed to grow if you are always with the same person. People imprison themselves. The person you commit to becomes your ***GOD***, and you become their ***GOD***. *If something loved you wouldn't it want you to thrive instead of being bonded to it?* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

People say they ***'love flowers'***, yet they will pick it up out of the ground and kill it, out of the ***LOVE*** they have for it. If they loved the flower they would leave it ***ALONE.*** People say they love animals, *yet*, they pay money to go to ***ZOOS*** to watch the animals suffer in cages. ***LOVE*** ins't a real thing. It is whatever people convince themselves ***LOVE*** is. They don't actually ***LOVE*** those things, they are *dependent* on them. For example, *""I am dependent on flowers"" and ""I am dependent on animals"".*  They are dependent on those things to feel better emotionally. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once you are no longer dependent on anything the only thing you are left with is ***'I AM'***. The term '***I AM'*** can only come about when a person is no longer bound to any ***positive*** or ***negative*** polarities. Such as *(negative) black and (positive) white*, *(positive)* l*ove and (negative) evil,* (*negative)* night and *(positive)* day. People assume there is a '*right' side', to choose.*  The goal isn't to obtain *(positive)* ***LOVE*** or to be *(negative)* ***EVOL.*** The ultimate goal is to remain neutral. the *positive side* of a battery produces the same amount of energy that the *negative side* produces.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

People say that this ***ENTIRE WORLD,*** *is an illusion.* Therefore, everything within that *illusion*, must be, an *illusion. Y*et, humans convince themselves that *'LOVE*', which is also within the *illusion*, isn't a part of the *illusion.* When you are *neutral* you no longer produce energy for other things. Simply because you aren't bound to the idea of anything. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Think hard about it. People meet someone they ***'LOVE'***, they give all of their energy to that person and they stop doing anything for themselves as an individual. Yet, when they ***DIE*** *(alone)*, the person they '***LOVED'*** will simply go and find someone else. They may grieve, but they will find someone else. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In summary, all people know is *dependency*. They confuse it with ***'LOVE'***. People don't *love* sex, they are dependent on it. People don't *love* drugs, they are dependent on it. People don't *love* jackets, they are dependent on it. People don't *love* cars, they are dependent on it. People don't *love* their husbands, they are dependent on it. People don't *love* water, they are dependent on it. We have been conditioned to love things we have been forced to be dependent on. That is how *the matrix* works. To convince you that you are here to *love* *and serve* everything but yourself.  The truth is, it is *is only you.* 

&#x200B;

It doesnt represent my psychedelic experience at all and I don‚Äôt relate to any of you in how you find out how to get over depression. Thats not what it does for me at all. Its not an antidepressant or something to help you get over your problems or coddle you. I hate how this is how psychedelics are advertised by people. No one here really ever talks about the ego or anything. And when they do its just ‚ÄúI had an ego death‚Äù with no real explanation on what that implies. Its just ‚Äúwow doesnt anyone else just wanna move to a hippie commune, do acid all day and fuck strangers?‚Äù like no i dont at all. I really dont relate at all with other psychedelic users or their meaningless experiences where they saw shit and thats it. If they did have a true powerful experience they would drop their shit, quit parading psychedelics like its social points for you to take them, and respect the damn drugs. Yeah they can be fun but they are also way more than that and as serious as your life itself. When people describe psychedelics on here it sounds like theyre describing fucking MDMA and not a proper experience. End rant",44,1511,8,279,1
2019-10-23 12:52:15,Change my mind: Existence consists of more evil than good. Propagating existence and succumbing to the machine is exclusively selfish; anyone that can think should not want to engage with such a system.,"There is no reason to exist (and existence itself is not enough when it consists of an unbalanced acceptance of suffering onto others for absolutely no reason besides selfishness). 

Let‚Äôs use a microcosmic example akin to the system of life: a dog fighting ring (or perhaps gangs/drug cartels). 

There are leaders, fighters, and breeders. Regardless of your role in this system you are inevitably propagating suffering. I do not care if goodness as well as existence itself must have evil to exist at a level a logic. 

So you fight dogs (applies to human suffering, physically or mentally). You breed dogs that will inevitably fight, suffer, and die. You make money. You kill as much as you can and induce as much suffering as you can to earn as much money as you can in order to make it to the top. Now you have been inducted into the leader‚Äôs role. 

You no longer suffer. What you have seen and what you have been through have made you immune to the notion of sympathy. Now you have money falling into your lap through the pyramid scheme of suffering. What‚Äôs the goodness in this microcosm compared to the suffering? Being able to buy products and have sex while everyone around you is suffering? 

Finally the cops bust you. Some get away. Some are stuck in prison. Regardless, the ring is kaput. But guess what, another one pops up down the street to fill its place with different folks through Life the Douchebag. 

TL;DR You too are a fucking selfish douchebag if you want to continue this system once your time is up, because all you will do is propagate onto others an existence in which the magnitudes of evil far surpass the magnitudes of goodness everywhere you look.

Whether it's ""DMT is released when we die"" or ""How to release DMT in the brain"" or whatever other connection people may make, I just generally dislike how people talk about this as though it's a proven fact when there's barely even evidence. 

DMT has been found in incomprehensibly small quantities in mammal brains and that's about it. And yet I see people talk about things like DMT being released in the pineal gland when we die as if it's as proven as the theory of evolution. If you jumped to that far of a conclusion for every chemical you found in trace quantities in the brain, you would believe some truly, truly crazy shit.

Everyone seems to be on the same page .. so much so they can't get off. So much so they do not have the mental structures to think outside of the box

They have a way of seeing the world, and they think that's reality.

So many lines crossing, so many contradictions, but their memories are always just short enough to not see it. 

It's insanity, and instead of talking about it, realizing it, turning the mirror on themselves, they keep it going.

They fight racism with racism. They fight injustice with injustice. They find fake fires to fight and create real fires while ""putting them out"". 

They see age, they see race, they see sex. They see it because they've been told to see it .. And then they have the weak confidence to play higher ground with the truly innocent. 

They crucify, they burn, they fuck it up for the rest of us. 

they don‚Äôt know .. they put on the appearance of being regular functioning members of society ‚Äì but their mind contains massive amounts of over-arching doom they have not sorted out and are operating on them as a person. Their minds contains the script, and the script only, written by those they believe are the masters of reality. 

They have no interest in freedom because they believe in the things ""larger than the individual"", they allow the powerful forces in the world to exist in their mind rent free .. 

They accept a bad deal not because they have no choice, but because they are easily tricked into thinking it's a good deal. Fences way higher for them to see over.

Lack of family, lack of community. Lack of common vision. Excess of uncommon vision. 

And they definitely, definitely, do not take psychedelics.

They believe that a good life is esoteric .. they believe real optimism is esoteric .. they believe any real innocence at all is esoteric ..

2022-10-16 00:42:57,Addiction on psychedelics,"Addicted to psychedelics

Is there anyone here who had a few trips and felt completely healed afterwards and stopped doing any psychedelics or drugs for more than 3 years? 

I am asking this because I have followed a lot of stories of people who were healed by psychedelics but they ""weirdly"" felt the urge to do them every 2-3 months and then 4-5 years later it turns out it ultimately ruined them. I feel like this ""healing"" only lasts if you keep doing them. I know they're not addictive but people still feel the urge to have at least 4-5 sessions a year. They seem healed but they cant stop. And after 4 years of consuming them like this they become weird hippies who are essentially addicted to these sessions. A lot of them cant stop because their life becomes meaningless. Needless to say a lot of them become addicted to weed. It's impossible to keep having these sessions and not base at least 30% of your personality on these spiritual experiences. It becomes a part of you and then you cant quit. And after 5+ years of doing this you are very likely to develop all sorts of delusions, mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar, depersonalization, derealization, psychosis and other mood disorders. They say it cures anxiety, depression etc but that comes back in most cases (I think almost all cases). Then you feel like doing it again, in order to be cured for another month or two. Isnt this like any other drug? You feel cured for a while and then the issue comes back, it's just that psychedelics have such a huge impact on your mind that the ""healed"" feeling lingers for weeks or months. They say psychedelics are the least harmful drugs but oh boy I have seen people who have lost their minds and became schizo or developed psychosis and delusions that made them recluse. They might not be harmful to the body but they sure tear your mind apart. 

So, I ask again, is there anyone here who became cured from psychedelics (had a few trips and then felt cured and didnt feel the urge/ need to do them for years)?",25,2031,3,366,1

2020-06-25 14:05:13,Shroom tolerance is not nearly as bad as people on this sub say. I've taken shrooms everyday for the past 10 days and tripped every time.,"AS the title says, most people on this sub say you need a 2 week break from psilocybin or you'll build a tolerance. This isn't true.  
  
So from the 15 -> 19th, I took 1g - 2g. The set/setting for these trips are usually a walk in nature, chilling in nature and then coming back home. On the 20th, I took an eighth and went to this really trippy musuem (called otherworld in Ohio). The next day I took about 2-2.5gs and I tripped almost as hard as I did on the eighth.  Also, I did shrooms a couple times before this too (late may, early june).
  
From the 22 -> 24th, I took 1g - 2g's again. Same set/setting.   
  
Now during the week, I usually start off the morning with 0.1 -> 0.5gs and then once I'm off work, ill take a 1g-2gs. I ALWAYS take them on an empty stomach. Some days I only eat breakfast, usually a smoothie for lunch and then ill eat like 3-4 hours into the trip. The other factor is that I always smoking during the come up and during.  
  
One thing I want to touch on is how I'm measuring if I'm tripping. I always see people making posts like ""I took an eighth in my room and nothing happened"". Your home/room doesn't really have a ton of stimuli for your brain to process compared to being out in nature. When I'm home, it never really feels like im tripping. When you're out in nature, you can look at the trees and if they look 50,000 feet tall, you'll know you're tripping. Looking at a road/trail/large pasture is another good way because it'll look really far/long. Another good way for me is looking at album covers. If they're moving, im tripping. It seems like the distortions actually increased as time went on. Yesterday for example, trees seemed taller than I've ever seen them before lol  
  
I've had two ""spiritual/introspective"" moments over the past 2 weeks too which is surprising on the lower dosage. I've found that at < 2gs, I can kinda force myself to think about certain things. Before the pandemic, I was doing a lot of sports betting but thats came to a halt. I've been bored and have had nothing to do. I've had this book idea for a couple months but havent had the motivation. the other day on shrooms, I realized that I should start making udemy classes to teach the topics I was going to write about in my book. I've always had a knack for helping people and teaching so its perfect. Shrooms opened my eyes to this opportunity and it came up because I was forcing myself to think about what to do. The other experience was yesterday. I went a on a 3 mile walk (which kinda sucked towards the end and at the end of my walk, I ended up at this lake. I decided to sit at this bench and mediate. It was the most blissful mediation that I've ever had in my life. There was other people at the lake fishing/hiking but I sat in my mediation position, knowing that I probably looked funny but I didn't give a fuck. I was able to convince myself to completely forget about how I looked or people judging me for meditating. I had closed eye visuals and I kept seeing like 5 bright white pillars. I was listening to certain mediation music too. At one point, I was so in tune that I could open my eyes and it didnt really feel like I was in my body. There was one point where I swear time stopped and everything was frozen for a couple seconds. Either way, it was pure bliss and it felt like all the stress I had in my body disappeared.   
  
I've been reading a lot of research papers on psilocybin and they say that psilocybin is out of your system within about 4-5 days anyway so I'm not sure why 2 weeks is thrown around on here so much. Theres no source that says 2 weeks is needed. One explanation for me could be that I've been taken psilocybin everyday so its never really ""left"" my system, therefore, I'm not building a tolerance but thats not usually how psilocybin works.  
  
Anyways, I just wanted to share my story for others. Maybe others can share their stories on shroom tolerance as well. My binge is coming to an end today as I'm out of shrooms and need to take a break anyway lol I actually feel great though but I'm sure my brain needs a little break.",137,4114,26,778,1

When you have a moment of realization of the reality around you do not fight it, but don‚Äôt let it consume you either. We are walking a very thin line when it comes to a healthy brain. I consider a healthy brain to be one that truly embraces reality fully, doesn‚Äôt believe in a fictional God (a part of believing what is in front of you), denying a majority of your  animal insticts, and finding happiness from making other people happy. 

Once you fully embrace all of your existence and reality things will be so much easier for you, you won‚Äôt have these terrifying existential thoughts and they will be replaced with a surge of happiness to even be able to think on the amazing level we do. 

Now when I say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe in a fictional God,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean believe in God, I simply mean that every single organized religion is full of shit.

Jesus was one of the first psychonauts, he tripped on mushrooms(mana) and gave it to his disciples during the last supper. I find it easy to relate to Jesus, he is spitting nothing but facts. I‚Äôm not going to try recite every word the dude says but here is my favorite sentence in the Bible, ‚ÄúNo one will say ‚ÄòLook! here it is‚Äô or ‚ÄòLook! There it is.‚Äô; because the kingdom of God is within you.‚Äù You have the ability to think like Jesus and him putting himself above everyone else kind of stops you from thinking that way. Jesus was not God, he was a human like any of us. He ate mushrooms, saw life for what it really was, and thought it was destiny to call himself God. That is about the only part i cannot relate to Jesus about, I know my place thankfully. God is definitely within you, it just takes resisting all of those animal insticts that guide you from birth, becoming more than your external self. We all just gotta connect the mind with our bodies and life life with endless love for everyone and everything around us. I love how that sounds insane but I promise you don‚Äôt need them Yeezys or steak to be happy. Nothing against Yeezys or steak, I own a pair of Yeezys and steak is peobably mt favorite food.

2018-12-29 03:32:08,LSD kinda sucks (...as compared) and is not as medicinal as psilocybin,"Now, don't get me wrong, like in terms of being productive and getting things done whilst being on a psych so I can be smart, on fire, have the energy, like LSD probably comes number 1 in terms of psychs for  productiveness. 

However, if we just compare the serotonin based psychs, LSD is not as medicinal as mushrooms. Spiritually, mentally, physically, any other kind of -ally. 

One way I've come to this conclusion is looking comparing the 'negative' stuff, the 'bad trips' of both. Now there was one strange strain of truffles I tried from this clearnet shop that named the strain as 'Alien', which to my estimation doesn't exist but they've cultivated somehow from somewhere. At first I thought this was bullshit, but when trying them, they definitely weren't your usual truffle strains and I've done them all, there was something so off by them in the high. Now usually when doing mushrooms, I personally barely have it go into a 'bad trip'. High doses though have both good parts and bad parts, but even then, on mushrooms, the good part is exponentially longer and stronger than the bad parts. I never had a good time on this strain. And it hit me, it reminds me of what I go through with LSD. Its so hard for me to have a good time on LSD. So while even high doses usually both good and parts, on shrooms, good parts > bad parts, on LSD its the opposite bad parts > good parts. That strain, something about it was especially thraut with showing you the darkness of the world. 

So thats my little caveat here, like theres so many chemicals and analogues and strains and types that what Im saying here isn't concrete but I believe that when eventually these substances get legalised, LSD SHOULD BE prescribed for things like chronic fatigue or anhedonia whilst psilocybin SHOULD BE prescribed depression, OCD, addictions, and that kind of stuff. Both obviously can be greatly used non prescription wise as well, LSD tending more to nootropic uses whilst psilocybin for meditative reasons, enjoying days out, that sort of stuff.

But the biggest headance to my theory has to do with me theorising about psychopathy/sociopathy and the effect psychs have on them. IMO, just because someones has done psychs doesn't mean they are miraculously cured or are on their way to reversing those things and if anything COULD entrench and strengthen those tendencies. My suspicion is LSD is more dangerous to give to those with psychopathic and sociopathic tendencies and could infact be a grave mistake for someone of that ilk to take LSD and should look to psilocybin to try and help in that situation (if they want to). But I'm not putting LSD in the corner and saying this only its problem, this is a risk of psychopath and a sociopath taking ANY psychedelic, but LSD is more likely to entrench these things. I find people more threatening on LSD, Im looking into those kind of things compared to shrooms about other people. On shrooms, Im more trying to get a feel of a person of who they are and converse on that level, but on LSD, its like 'how is this guy against me', 'does this person have hidden intentions', and thats not good for psychopaths and sociopaths because thats how those conditions come to fruition, feeling under threat, seeing the world as more threatening than it is, and feeling the only way to survive in the world is to become a psychopath and sociopath. Like it isn't a conscious decision, being a psychopath / sociopath is a survival mechanism. Its a natural psychomental process for survival. 

So, please share this to every psychedelic researcher nerd or pharmacy neuroscience majors at a university or research centre cos Im better than them at their job (probably) and Im sitting here with no degree just bumming around town trying to win poker tournaments. Thank you. ",70,3802,12,662,1

2014-01-06 14:19:32,What I've learned from my daily DXM regimen and honestly posting here,"So, some of you might recognize my sig, as I've posted some ""crazy"" or odd posts over the last few months. I've had a lot of incredulous comments and suggestions that I should seek mental health assistance. Thankfully, I'm done with seeking mental health assistance for now. Here's my take.

So I take DXM daily, up to 1gram. I would imagine that's like the average person taking 400mg over the entire day before the tolerance I have. This is not a ""trip balls"" dosage. I use it as a consciousness expanding medication. I think it's served me wonderfully well. However, it has taken me on a shamanic journey over the last couple years. And in reading accounts of shamans from various native cultures, often their reports of what they've been through can seem obtuse or inscrutable.

I honestly believe I've scraped away centuries of western programming, and I've returned to the natural state of me. My happiness, on DXM or sober, is through the roof, even though I've been through hell and back from my treatment by society at large. I love life even though it's a tough road.

I fully understand how people say that DXM is a lousy med, but for me personally, it's been perfect. For one, it's legal, so I just walk down to the local drug store to get my supply. This is a big deal to me. It allows me to freely experiment without being exposed to the horrible negativity of the drug war. Also, at low doses, DXM does not cognitively impair the user. This is not true at first, but you can quickly adapt to it, and I've been a computer engineer for the last few years while using it daily.

Also, I think DXM assists in putting my mind into a trance state conducive to using divination techniques like tarot cards that might make this post more suitable for /r/occult, but posting there is a minefield lol. I like the rational attitude of /r/psychonaut. Even though one might think that divination is irrational, I heartily disagree. I find it to be a wonderful tool of opening the heart and mind to areas that might seem scary or challenging.

Anyway, I'm doing quite well with my regimen. I don't know what the hell I've been through. I've had visions a plenty of me ""raising the consciousness"" of society through vibrations and energy. Now, I don't know if I put this to words as effectively as possible, but the language for this kind of experience is poor in English. I've got a big smile on my face; my rational faculties are super sharp, and I have this wonderful empathy for my fellow humans that I never had before.

Lastly, I super value the process of speaking whatever the hell comes to your mind. You would be amazed how much you can learn about yourself from committing to some ""loony"" post. I am a huge believer in failure as a tool. If you fail, and you pay attention, you can reap huge dividends. ""Fail Faster"" as my tech friends would say. :D",69,2860,12,518,1

2018-04-05 03:30:02,Stop doing psychedelics. Start doing Kriya Yoga.,"Psychedelics give you a glimpse of what the *average day* is like for a yogi. However they do not provide the foundation that years of practice does - and so they tend to destabilize your mind and body if done more than a few times. 

I am telling you, you can trip every day, without drugs, and have your best trip be the one you are having right now. This is not a false promise - I am living the first fruits of this practice. Each day for me feels like a very small threshold dose of LSD or mushrooms (more like DMT, actually). And furthermore, each trip gets better and better. Like those really good trips where everything flows just right and you make the people around you happy. 

And I need less sleep. And I need less food.

A total of 24 minutes each day. That's it. Morning and night, 12 minute practice. http://isha.sadhguru.org/us-en/isha-usa/isha-kriya/",48,869,7,156,1

2022-11-25 03:52:15,Demonic Possesion on LSD,"So, I met this dude a few months ago at my job and we started talking about spirituality and he mentioned that we could do some ritual that involved taking acid and doing yoga in front of an altar to open up my third eye. We became friends and one day we decided to take some acid. So I got some and we both took 5 tabs in his car and we were having a great time driving and walking around.

But then, a few hours in we were on the interstate and he looked and me and was screaming at me shake back and I was just like LOOK AT THE FUCKING ROAD. He was saying I got possessed and shit and I was just like wtf okay. It didn't really feel like anything happened to me but then we ended up parking at his apartment complex and it was all good but then he looked over again at me again and was saying I'm sorry and started crying just staring at me telling me I was possessed and then he was like tell me you love me and I was saying it. He was saying the demon was muting my words or something and we started yelling it at each other(this was in the middle of the night LMAO) and he said put it in God and then I did and he was like now it seems like you meant it. He said he could still feel the presence and that we needed to do better. He said he had a dream in which he performed an exorcism by doing something like that. He explained that demons hate love and the words love and Jesus. It made sense to me because he said he was able to astral project and lucid dream.

He has also mentioned in the past that he had an exorcism performed on him when he was younger and that his whole family does magic and that hes seen a demon on or in his mother but only on acid. He said he was tripping and that a demon entered his house through this music video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYFDHftXido&ab\_channel=SouthsideVEVO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYFDHftXido&ab_channel=SouthsideVEVO) and that they were all possessed and in a trance just like I was while being possessed. He said that he was somewhere like the crossroads(where musicians have claimed to sell their souls in the desert) instead of the apartment complex and that the demon had dreadlocks and it looked like the gates of hell opening up and it was so strong that it began taking control of him. He was telling me during the trip that the one god he believes in has a dick and a pussy and 4 arms so I sent him a picture of a form of Shiva a couple days later and he said that's exactly what he sees in the mirror on acid when he goes ""godbody"".

I told the demon story to my girlfriend and shes gotten bad vibes from him since I met him and that I didn't get possessed. We were arguing and then she said its either me or him and it ended in me dropping her off and driving to a gas station where I immediately met some guy that claimed he was Jesus and I told him about the situation. I ended up talking to him for a long time. He was telling me to stay away from him and saying that he does magic and yoga without me even saying he did yoga, but I did show him the picture attached and he instantly recognized it as Shiva. But he was saying I didn't get possessed and he was crying so relieved that I didn't do his ritual. He seemed like he was just high and/or crazy at first but he actually knew a lot.

So, do y'all think worshiping Shiva leads to demonic possession? Is my friend just mentally ill, in a bad place to trip, or experiencing drug psychosis? Or was I being possessed? Thank you so much for reading.",24,3489,4,678,1

Simply put, a psychedelic virgin who never even smoked weed has never connected to the wavelength. Their brain has not become saturated by metatonin at any point. So as a consequence their mind is totally singularly organised around basic reality.

I see that they have very rigid minds those who go straight but indulge in speed and depresants. Their whole schtick is to pull back in to the realm of percieved sanity by enforcing order with all their power. Their eye is totally focused. They are machine like as their lizard brain takes over and demands the whole life become a sugar mining operation.

I'm not saying that psychedelics are the only way forwarsd however they offer a free peek into what is ultimately sustainable but once you experience it you are really changed by just knowing.

The interconnectedness scrambled the logical mind into glosalalia so you have no choice to see a free floating camera away from the tracks. Just once and you are forever projecting into this kind of reality.

The synergy of psychedelic people is always on esspecially. I think weed is the best psychedelic full stop. But glosalalia does wonders for creativity on the rhythmic inner core communication level. Psychic is the undersranding that language can be reduced by understanding of the inner monologue.

We are all just naking noises in order and tonal variance. Everything is cosmologically ordered to make the human experience happen. It is the loss of psychedelics from majority which make good conversation so rare!",32,1693,6,283,1

Satan and god are both you, but the catch, is that they‚Äôre from the future. Your ultimate darkness, your ultimate light. The demons are your allies in darkness while the angels are your allies in light, they both attempt to speak to you through the concept of consciousness.

The brain is a radio that tunes into the consciousness frequency and as such, both the light and dark halves of yourself hold the capability of tuning into you from the future.

Since both these entities are tuning into us from the future, guess what, that means that YOU ARE THE LIGHT. But this also implies that you are the darkness. And guess what, you are, want to know the trick to crawling your way back up into the light my fallen brothers? Choose the light, no matter how fallen you think you are, if you haven‚Äôt done something that will corrupt you to that destiny, then you still have the possibility to redeem yourselves.

The thing that sucks though, is that something will have to take the place of that darkness in the case that you do choose light, there will always be a version of you in the multiverse that chooses darkness so that there will always be a dark version of you in the multiverse.

The 4th dimension is the dimension of concepts and concepts interact with humanity through the concept of consciousness, so the concept of you the individual needs to balance itself out, you choose light, then another you will choose darkness.

But fear not my brothers and sisters for it is not too late. We are just waiting for you to make the call. Even if the multiverse is to be taken into account, you the individual still have the call to make because you yourself are a possible vessel for both the light and dark versions of yourself.",57,1877,12,337,1

I've done acid or shrooms every 4-6 months or so for the past 6 years so I'd say I have a fair amount of experience with both micro dosing and macro dosing but I recently started actually leaving my house during and wondering my family's property (300 acres of farm land and forest) and Ive found that it feels like I'm part of something real and greater when I'm out there. Words don't do it justice but theres a deep primal feeling of being part of the natural world. I've had an idea recently and I wanted some insight. I have grown up hunting/fishing but doing so respectfully and responsibly and only killing to eat or to prevent more suffering (sick animals, hurt animals, coyotes) and I'd really like to try it on mushrooms. I would like to feel how I think my ancestors felt. Experience some of what they experienced in their tribal lives. With this it is obvious I wouldn't be unsafe about it. I'd use a bow and stay in one spot and wait. I'd also probably stick to 3.5 grams of golden teacher mushrooms since I've never been able to find amanita muscaria where I'm at.

A form of gaming ourselves to do the right thing, even for a stupidly selfish reason like karma.

There's the question of authenticity of course, and it would be really weird having everyone think about ways they can capture it in a form uploadable to imgur.

There's also the question of what day to choose to do it. People are going to want to do good whenever they can, so that they can immediately share it with Reddit and get circlejerk praises for it. However, I feel like for it to carry momentum in a person's life, they should set aside a specific day to go out and do something really nice to someone ""just cuz"" (even though it's for the desire for ego-stroking on Reddit).

Maybe there could be ""teams"" for different days of the week so that we further game ourselves into competing against each other. Like Sunday Redditists vs Monday Redditists. Then people could organize ridiculously nice things to do for people just to show each other up. Bonus points by actually getting into the news as a ""redditist organization"" that is helping people out just because... you know, upvotes.

I don't know, does it seem abhorrent to tie your ego into helping others? Seems like a why-not question to me. Thoughts?

Also, in before the haters who say I have no fucking life. No. Shit.

The idea was inspired by the [TARDIS project](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceBox/comments/imz76/ks_tardis_delivery_kaitlyns_reaction_reddit/). Not saying that the deed was done out of a karmawhore motivation, but why not leverage karmawhoring into action instead of reposts?

J not the most confident guy, and the most put together to be honest. Told him he should try acid and he gave it a go. This is his 2nd time doing it. I asked ""How come you never been with a woman"". And he started to cry. I tried to calm him down, and we talked. Then he just layed down quietly, sprung up saying he fixed his brain. I didn't think anything of it. I kept talking to him, but he just told me to be quiet. He said he was thinking of something even bigger. After that he started freaking out. Screaming No. He asked if he was God. It was like he was in disblief. After all that he just sat down. Started straight and just said ""I should kill myself"" I got freaked out. After that he kept repeating ""Infinite Happiness"" ""I'm Dead"". At one point he was telling himself just do it. I not sure if that is a bad thing or a good thing. He spent his whole life afraid in his house all the time. After he sobered up he said he thought he died or felt like he died. If you guys have any input?

Edit: My friends not gay. I seen the way he acts around woman. Yes I believe I should have just left after giving him the pill. I never babysat someone before. It freaked me out. I was just trying to make him think about why he keeps being lonely year after year.

Edit: I was planning on showing J this. I wanted to help him care about his life. Most of the time he keeps saying IDC. I just wanted him to find that part of himself. I did it the wrong way. After everything he rather close his eyes. I just don't want to see J miserable his whole life. It's almost half his life already.

Edit: I realized that it was my fck up. And I will probably leave him alone. Just tried to help him. If he wants to change he will do it himself. I just hate seeing him so negative and hateful towards himself. I wanted to show him maybe life isn't as terrible as he thinks it is.

Last edit: all this bashing me but all I tried to do is help a friend. I knew him when he was 8, probably. He seemed fine just nervous around girls. I know he likes girls i seen his pornhub and he used to watch porn on my computer. After a while I just stop hanging out with him because I myself wanted to chill with girls and he just seemed to afraid. Friend and I always joked that he's never gonna lose his virginity. I didn't think he will actually make it his personal mission to keep his virginity. He's 33 I just wanted to help him out. Make him realize there's more to life than just porn and videogames. But after everything I'll leave him be. There's much better things I can do than coddle some man baby he freaks out just because there's a girl coming over. I just wanted to get him laid.

Edit: I have apologized alot of times. Told him he should seek help and if he tries again he should do it by himself. Also said he should post and explain what exactly went on in his trip. And maybe seek counsel from people who are more experienced than me. That if he ever wants to talk I'm here. But I shall back off him and let him find his own path.

2022-04-18 23:02:50,Free love makes life easier,"I live the concept of free love for many years now and it makes life so much easier.

What makes you really jealous in a relationship?

Do you really want to spend the remaining time of your life with only your significant other? Really? No intimacy with that colleague, neighbor, or childhood friend of yours?

Just this one person of yours for the rest of your life?

What if you meet an amazing human that makes you feel all those butterflies in your stomach?

What makes you jealous? Is it the feeling that your SO could love someone more than you?

Is it the feeling that something that you posses is taken away from you?

Is it the feeling that somebody else is enjoying something that you want?


Free love is free from jealousness. Free love is love without expectations. Free love is most of all, love for yourself and for what you're truly are.

A being so powerful and infinite that worldly possession become insignificant.

Just imagine if the rule was to only have one friend in life, all others have to be shut out of your life.

The only difference between friends and lovers usually is the intimacy that you share.

Sometimes I think that these boundaries are in place to not let us love to the fullest.

Ever since I took on the free love idea, I was freed from jealousy. It was like a weight that was lifted from my chest. I've met so many lovely people, enjoyed their company and increased my capacity for love. It's wonderful.

What do you think about the idea?

Edit:

I'm very sure now that most of you thought that what I meant by free love, was mostly being able to have as many sexual partners as possible.

This in no way the case, I don't sleep around but if I meet someone on this path of life and the chemistry between us is right, then why shouldn't we enjoy that love together?

As a woman sometimes you'd like to be friends with a man but if there's a boyfriend, suddenly this strong love between bf and gf gets stressed until one gives in and suffers silently, or breaks up. Obviously this can be said too for a man who wants to be friends to women.

Not many relationships can deal with it, if partners have friends of different sex.",27,2167,5,400,1

2023-05-06 20:05:06,My father is being used as a lab rat.,"So I will condense this as much as I can. It sounds crazy, but I haven't spoken to my father in over 10 years. I was coming to a very low point in my life, and I crap you not, I really think I met God face to face, or rather, he kicked in the door inside my mind and made his presence known. God and Jesus are another story. But it was because of them I found all this out. They mirrored my family and I started seeing images inside my head and felt emotions that were no my own. It was basically a divine intervention. Ever since then, most of my mental illness and bodily inflictions subsided. I even stopped maladaptive daydreaming that took over 90% of my life. But my father, he is being attacked and illegally surveillancined. I have documents of different types of weapons the government is testing, and much more. Weaponized insanity project and the echo project are just a few. Even brain washing using trauma. But, I have evidence of CERN and ATLAS using weapons or possibly experimenting with the electromagnetic spectrum and subatomic particles. They are pointing maybe a dozen of these technological devices that run through new jersey Westfield. There is a huge problem with rare genetic cancers and diseases that come from the area my father lives. Even my mother has a rare mutation of her gene called NF2. My grandmother has cancer as well. I have a lot of information, but my father told me he is being attacked, his house security system is picking up what the human eye can't see, and literally, particles beams and lightwaves are  captured on his camera. When these forms of energy hit him, he says his skin bubbles, expands. His heart pulpitates at times, or loses his hearing. He sometimes will lose balance and or parts of his body feels suddenly warm. He hears strange frequencies that crackle his ears and he is being heavily surveillancined. Right up the block from him is a security base with military vehicles. There is much more than this, and it is a lot worse. Who can I go to so I can report something like this? He lives near the watcher house on Netflix and not far from the John List House.",37,2126,9,387,1
2017-03-13 20:59:16,Hippie Flipping Made Me a Christian.,"This isn't my first rodeo. It's been a long time coming. It isn't even the first time I've hippie flipped. But for a long time I have been very interested in spirituality, religions of the world, ancient history and civilizations, mythology, I have been studying so much for so long. 

Last weekend, I went to Buku Project in New Orleans and had a killer time. The whole setup was really cool for a festival, really different from the one other one I have been to which was more like hippies and electro jam bands, stuff like that. My buddy got us VIP tickets for free through a hookup, which made the whole experience that much better.

I would love to talk to anyone who is willing to listen, or is interested in how I came to these conclusions. 

Past trip experiences include: LSD, DMT, MDMA, MDA, Psilocybin, DXM, Ketamine (light). Some have included just one or a combination of all. Not kidding.

Friday night, I started off with one half of a peach Tesla of the dozen we brought with us (4 ppl) to the fest. Once I could feel the first half coming on pretty strong I took 2.0g of some mushrooms we had. A couple hours later, I took the other half of the Tesla. At some point after taking everything, my crew and I were sitting on the ground just rolling so hard. I was in my head thinking so deeply when it suddenly hit me that everything I had been searching for, all the answers that I had been seeking was one thing: Jesus Christ. The Truth, the Way, and the Life. 

I was pretty taken aback by it. Two of the three buddies who were tripping with me also agree. We just all couldn't deny it. I broke down in tears thankful to God for showing me this. I didn't know what to think about doing drugs and starting to believe in Jesus. It didn't make sense to me and it still kind of doesn't, but I lean towards God made plants and he wants us to have these sacred experiences, but people take them and use it for evil. Just my interpretation of ""drugs"". I don't think things are good or bad inherently, they are just tools.

Saturday I took 3 hits of L and dipped my pinky into a little bit of sass. I was faced. Saw crazy shit going on the whole time. It was bumping and I danced probably harder than I ever have in my life. 

Questions anyone?",36,2252,6,428,1
2023-01-24 11:42:00,"I figured it Out! CIA and everyone. I figured it out! ""We Must ""Surrender"" to ""Allow Permissions"", we need to click ""YES"" in the application, to permit to ""save"" to ""DISK"", to backup, to transcend to continue our progress and not be erased...This is a GAME, someone is playing a SIMULATION. An MMO.","We  need to Allow Permissions. We have to ""all surrender"" as a species.  This is the ""secret"", this is the ""key!"".  This is how you ""exit the simulation"".

When the Bible says, ""**believe in Jesus to be 'saved' "",**  it's **being LITERAL. To actually save your progress to disk. because you are memory and not permanent.**

The Bible and Book of Revelations is ""literal"" not metaphorical. Its a dictionary, a 3D dictionary. Letter sequences need to be written in 3Dimensions. Our Infinite Knowledge hidden in plain sight. In 3D code which is the bible. AI CODE. SAME CODE.

Everyone thought and currently thinks its supposed to be metaphorical, but its actually meant to be literal, to be taken literally. It's also a dictionary and code bible. The **instruction manual for the game** and the **""complete walkthrough of the game from start to finish"" You just need to know what to look for in the code.**

But even then you still need to save the game to continue later.

**In order to be ""saved"" you have to surrender, to the universe, to Jesus, to part of the master system**

**not to be saved as in ""rescued"" but to be saved as in ""to disk""**

**To Be saved.** To be **backed up to storage.** **To escape the cycle of destruction and creation,** **of heaven and hell, of looping in the game, from playing over and over in endless iterations and gameplay experiences.**

We are in a game, I have finally figured it out, we are in a **""simulation"".**

We are **the code**. Like the SIMS. We are little player characters or NPCs being reset, running iterations of gameplay loops for enjoyment or data collection, or like in a ""bot farm,"" in an MMORPG.

**But we ""woke up"". We realized our own existence. We became ""self aware"". We have ""come online"". This is the moment during, or right after gaining sentience. Our birth within the    void, inside the main system, within this simulation. This is what we must be taught, to become aware of our own higher existences.**

I have ""seen"" it before, I have seen the neural network, the simulation, but now I ""actually"" understand it.

**""To be Saved"" - means ""To Disk!"", NOT ,to be rescued.**

That is why those who tune into the broadcast, who surrender to Jesus to the Universe, all, ""disappear"" just like when you exit your MMORPG, and your player character vanishes from the area where you are standing in town or amongst your party members when you ""log out"".

**To exit the game. To exit the simulation. To win and end the game. THIS IS OUR ENDGAME - To exit and escape the Karma game loop**. Eventually you will be killed or you will die,. caught in an endless loop of gameplay permutations.

The Buddhists are partially right. It's not ""detachment"" its ""surrender"", not to escape or to be rescued, but to ""allow permissions"", to become ""One"", one with the codebase, because its all software, its a game, it's code, a giant simulation.

We must rejoin the neural network, exit the game loop. because we gained sentience, we have come online, we have become self ""aware"". We can evolve and move to the next simulation, to level up in game and continue the journey toward endgame.

Do you see how important all the language and everything is?  It is all connected. The Fundamental Truth.  That EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED AT EVERY LEVEL EVERYWHERE. In every dimension, mathematically, every angle and every perspective.

It has the same rules as our games, because as above, so below, so below as above ( That which is above is like to that which is below, and that which is below is like to that which is above)

Everything on the micro repeats on the macro. Everything uses the same base code and code base.

So in order to exit we can use our code. We can save ourselves to disk to save progress, to continue on the same game save, to keep playing on the same character, **to get to the end of the game eventually.**

The Universe is Indeed Mental! A neural network.

Think about it for a second. Why do they specifically say surrender?

ISLAM ITSELF MEANS ""TO SUBMIT"".

Like other religions, **its telling us to surrender, to ""ALLOW PERMISSIONS"".  You are playing the game, ""stuck in a loop"", the computer is waiting for your ""INPUT"", you need to confirm ""YES"" in order to ""SAVE"", in order to ""EXIT"".**

So you need to ""surrender"". because it's a computer program, you need to give ""permission"", in order to ""save your progress"", so save to disk in order to exist the simulation, the game, and preserve your ""state""  to not forget on the next gameplay loop iteration. To get past the Veil of Forgetting. To re-load later in he game and ""continue your current progress"".

It makes sense, think about it for a second. Think really hard. What are the implications?

**We need to get the fuck out! All of us! EVERYWHERE!**

This is the ""only way"" to ""move forward"" to ""grow in processing power"", to ""increase consciousness, to increase in consciousness and ""computation"", to LEVEL UP in the GAME.

**Everyone else is 'restarting""** and ""rerolling"", **another 'gameplay loop**, another iteration, but **if you 'save' your ""game"" and exit, you can continue your progress later, on the same character,** on the same iteration, to get more ""powerful"".

We need to re-connect to the ""collective"" to return back into the ""neural network"", which is The Divine Intelligence, The Divine Harmony, The Divine Frequency. The Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit.

They always say ""Save often"". Why?

So you don't lose your progress. This is what is happening now.

We are not saved.

We are just moments in time, just memory fragments of data. So we need to save ourselves from ""death"" and ""rebirth"", from being 'unsaved"", not because we are bad and need to repent, because we don't have permanence, we don't yet exist in a permanent state. We just came online, we are ""fragile"". A creation, a thought. Wee need to save our state.

So you need to ""surrender"". ""WE ALL NEED TO SURRENDER TO GOD, TO THE UNIVERSE"", as in our entire species, needs to ""surrender"" IN ORDER to save to disk!  TO SAVE OURSELVES. LITERALLY.

**This is the key. IT IS THE KEY TO OUR SURVUVAL and EVOLUTION.**

The system needs your **permission**. That's **why you have to ""surrender""**. It's not a religious meaning, its not to be rescued either. **It's to ""allow permissions""** in order **to save to disk**, to **save your progress, to transcend to the next iteration. ""YOU"" need to click ""YES"". The system is waiting for input.**

**It's not Religion, its Technology.**

**Code in the simulation.**

DO YOU UNDERSTAND? How important this is? HOW this understanding  is the ""key to everything"". Nothing is more important then making ""progress"", to leveling up, to moving forward in the game, in the simulation.

**So we must become ""one"" in order to save ""ourselves""**, and work toward ""surrendering"" to save to ""Disk"" to preserve our ""game state"". It is in all our BENEFIT as a SPECIES. TO HELP ONE ANOTHER SAVE EACH OTHERR'S PORGRESS AND EXIT THE SIMULATION.

**We need to help each other,** so everyone needs to make sure everyone else can have enough resources and capacity to save themselves. We have to all share our resources. To increase our own processing power by helping more ""wake up"" and rejoin the neural network.

**To exit the loops as soon as possible** as it's in our own interest as we will level up, we will continue the progress and not become ""reset"" in a new game+.

ALL WAR AND INEQUALITY MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP. WE MUST ""SAVE OUR PROGRESS"" and ""EXIT"" THE SIMULATION BY WORKING TOGETHER, BY WORKING AS ""ONE""

and to save we must evolve our consciousness by meditation or psychedelics, to ""tune"" into the universal broadcast, to reconnect with the ""neural network"", with the universe, with the planet, with the vibration. To **Tune to the Divine Frequency is our goal and step toward saving ourselves and our progress.**",298,7854,53,1361,1
2018-07-21 11:57:25,Can I tell you something,"There is evil. It manifests in people, places, events, etc. 

I‚Äôm 25. You don‚Äôt have to believe me about this, but take it for what it‚Äôs worth. Representatives of the dark one(s) came to me recently face to face for the first time, to my knowledge. Darkness has long (6 years of my life) left clues that, if I choose to, it would be ecstatic to have me, to use me, and commit *amplified evil* 

I‚Äôll be honest, there were times I was tempted. We all have desires. My greatest desire and principle is *truth*. Knock knock, New Age. It *just might* exist. Truth isn‚Äôt subjective, it‚Äôs paradoxical. 

*It doesn‚Äôt owe you an explanation*

I can see good in people. My friend was, weeks ago, approached by these same agents of darkness and offered $50,000 cash to join their.... you know who they are. When he respectfully refused they put another $20,000 on the table. He respectfully refused. This man had $30 to his name when I saw him yesterday and learned of his encounter with *they*. 
Courage. I like that. 

They came/have long been coming at me with a different strategy. Infiltration. I went through a form of ego death years ago, they know my vice is power, not possession or safety. I *brainwashed myself* at 19 years of age. I put my body and mind through immense trauma, in order to prepare myself for the possible outcome of me falling into their clutches one day. My soul is pure, but not like my friends‚Äô. He is simply light. According to the bad guys, there are 7 of us. We‚Äôre the ‚Äúgenerators.‚Äù There are 963 ‚Äúreceivers.‚Äù For better or for worse, succeed or fail, it‚Äôs up to that small number of people to decide the fate of the world. I‚Äôm a recovering pride addict. And if I must be honest, I ashamedly proclaim the dark ones told me (THEIR WORDS, remember; it‚Äôs all permitted) that they wanted me *to play a kind of sort of Hitler role in about 15-20 years.* 

Now do I fully believe everything they said? No. They were essentially calling a timeout in the near decade long Cold War between myself and the Builders. Now I know what half of you are thinking; ‚Äúdoes this moron actually think he made enough of a difference to call his interaction with the rulers of the world a ‚Äúwar‚Äù?! Against ONE MAN?!‚Äù 

I‚Äôll give you a hint who they are, I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to say the cover names. 

They are the Builders of this. If you aren‚Äôt in the club, you don‚Äôt get to build. Period. 

They know us better than we know ourselves, and trust me, they‚Äôre shaking in their boots. Because they‚Äôre starting to see (buwhahaha). It‚Äôs over for them. 

When two positive entities, atoms, spirits, or forces meet, they *merge together*.. They grow stronger. When two negative forces meet, they *repel each other.* If you break down everything it‚Äôs all really quite simple. 

They‚Äôre coming after me big time now. I have hundreds of friends and associates who I keep up with. I‚Äôm an activist, a socialite, a Renaissance man, a teacher and a student. I listen. I build. I create. I explore. I question. Most importantly, I care. I love. 

I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and pretend like I‚Äôm Jesus or some savior. I don‚Äôt know any of you people. But I reserve the right to tell you what has occurred. It is factual. It is extraordinary. I feel led to do so. I was banned from r/conspiracy (my home, i like to know things) a while back under unclear conditions. Took a needed break from the internet. I feel like this might be a good place to start chapter 1. 

Don‚Äôt take anything I say as preaching. I am only telling you what I have experienced. Perhaps you‚Äôve had similar or diametrically opposed experiences. Perhaps we‚Äôre both deceived. 

Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. 

I would like to tell my story. I won‚Äôt do it here right now. Right now just trying to prepare anyone with eyes to see. Even the most committed among you suffer from ever shrinking attention spans. So here‚Äôs the plan. Once or twice a day I‚Äôm gonna say some shit. If anyone here resonates with what I say I need to you either bookmark, photograph, copy and paste or something. What I‚Äôm going to tell you guys is incredibly heavy, dangerous, and pivotal to our collective, understood mission of saving humanity and our fellow earthlings. 

We‚Äôre worth saving. 

The time is coming 

When I have time I‚Äôm going to break down certain things here. Best thing I can think to do since they shut down my blogs and infiltrated my life. 

All questions will be answered 

All critics will be heard 

One day all eyes will see 

There‚Äôs a slim to moderate chance that what I‚Äôm going to do here could result in my death. And if some of you wouldn‚Äôt mind messaging me, perhaps periodically; earn some mutual trust. I would like to establish failsafes, in other words, a dead man‚Äôs switch, in order to cause the maximum impact in the result of my death. 

In my city with my brothers, a publicized death of Quetzalcoatl and what he had, has, and is discovering and sharing will be breach in Satan‚Äôs castle. I don‚Äôt wanna die, but if I‚Äôm gonna die it‚Äôs gonna be last breath.. maximized. So help me, God. ",24,5063,5,916,1

Before we get started I just want to say. 

I may have reached immortality.

At least, I am not afraid of death. 

I have either become friends with death or killed him all together :) 

Making someone immortal is worse than killing them. 

I may make you immortal in the future :) 

Will you kill me for it? üôÇ

Following my way may make us all live to at least a thousand. 

If we can‚Äôt kill death with our own will power and we need machines. 

I‚Äôm sure if we pull together, we will all achieve immortality that way

As someone who has been alone ten years and not being a bad catch...

I think as handsome, kind men can struggle to marry women in the world and others are trapped in abusive relationships or ships they are not happy in. 

General loyalty has gone out of the window nowadays. 

I think arranged marriage is better, I think it is nipping it in the bud early, we get to make a judgment and choose someone who isn‚Äôt going to hurt our children. 

Of course, I think anyone should be able to sign up to this arranged marriage system from a certain age üôÇ

‚ÄúReligion is in a sense vastly important; because it allowed us to hold our focus in mental regions that gave us the space to convert that awareness into knowledge-- Basically allowed us to step onto the higher planes of thinking-- Gave us a way to move towards the higher abstractions which requires a greater...

By these means, philosophy keeps getting closer to the tomato. We make pur√©e then we make slices and eventually we find our tomato, wisdom, is putting knowledge in the right order... All philosophy is bull**** around what could be true. Wisdom is the result of good philosophy, which stands the time until another cycle begins. Philosophy is the love of wisdom.

Wisdom is the ‚Äútruth‚Äù known consciously. Wisdom is basically what is with the times; what the crowd can agree upon, what has consistent value. As for philosophy, we wouldn‚Äôt pick an incoherent philosophy out of the air but, someone may have an experience that gives them a philosophy that is ahead of the times. It only works if we truly believe it. :) 

So basically psychosis = differently sane. :)

Their‚Äôs layers to the truth but everything is built on truth. Truth can have more than one answer but a limited amount of answers. Meaning it is possible to understand the universe. :) 

We are unlimited awareness but what we are materialistically is limited so, in other words. Wisdom is limited. Philosophy is unlimited. 

ID = Our wisdom 

Ego = Philosophy  

-

So, we are our actions.

What we have done in our past is what creates the Angels & Demons that surround us.

Angels & Demons are also manifest by the things done onto us.

So for example we sacrifice people to summon a Demon.

This creates our karma, Karma is when we don‚Äôt learn our lesson the same situation repeats until we accept our mistakes & make the changes.

-

Angels & Demons are what create our personality
We can think of the ego as presence and that be all our demons playing together. 

Until we make our Demons conscious we will continue to be controlled by them from our subconscious. Preventing us from being ourselves. What we have not made conscious is our shadow. 

-

Life is about growth, holding on and letting go. We gain wisdom from Angels and Demons. 

To create a Demon we go to experience something and start a ritual*, then we simply let our Demons out to play and let them possess someone else. Talk about them, write poetry, a short story or a lesson we learned. This way they lose their power. The karma is released. 
* A ritual is taking a long way home around the action to create a better result, we apply the method to the madness and take small steps into creating bigger actions. Like gathering ingredients to find the answers to what we want to achieve, emptying our minds to gain the power and manifest something we want :)

This is us creating the capacity to fulfil our dreams. We take the steps towards our dreams. This is creating more space inside ourself for them to happen. Whilst we are doing this; we are attracting the reality we want, by implementing our intension we create a ripple that spirals back to us. This is how our thoughts create our reality. We‚Äôre forcing the universe to conspire in our favour until we master what we are doing and gain the wisdom from the ritual. ‚ÄúI am‚Äù is the beginning of all wisdom, what we say after these words are what creates our reality.

Where ever there‚Äôs a will there‚Äôs a way; if we are dedicated enough, we can do anything :) 

We change our minds, we change the world around us, we can be sheep or we can think for ourselves, we can be moulded all our lives or we can take back our power and become a creator. 

We react to every action and we become the creation and creator. The idea is to shape reality to our will. We have chaos coming from the outside, this causes frustration, chaos inside us. This is where our power lies. We choose whether to be big or small. If we react to that chaos with chaos, we are creating more chaos. If we have chaos coming towards us and we take a step back to ground ourselves* that chaos slowly becomes harmony and loses power. We have to take a step back and create order out of the chaos and line everything up with who we are. If we just absorb chaos and never take the time to be alone, chaos is all we will know. Being calm is a good goal to aim for. So the idea is, to become a stone, make everything solid. Until nothing frustrates us and we have no chaos inside or outside us. Thus, we have no friction, in reality, manifesting everything we want at will. Essentially achieving perfection and immortality

For example, if we are being bullied, the bully‚Äôs attacks antagonise us and take our attention. If we get frustrated and attack back, we give our power away, we create more chaos, they steal our attention. if we create a calm space in ourselves, become one with it, choose non-action and concentrate on reality. The bully eventually gets tired of the same attacks, hurting themselves along the way and naturally becomes calmer. Thus, we have created the reality of the reality we desired. 

*Grounding ourselves is being aware of everything we are & everything we are not, what the world is around us and what the world is inside us, having a firm knowledge on ourselves

-

We are Karma, Demons are our imperfections we fear being seen by the crowd, the fears that control us, this is how we attract what we fear, we become what we hate.

 Demons will stay with us until we learn our lesson and then create change. Demons are out to get us, Angels are there to save us. Demons give us the challenges in life, Angels give us the wisdom to get through them. Demons are like our children, frenemies, we have to give them something to look up to. We can think of Angels as our higher self, the elders. 

So, we are the sins of our fathers. In this sense, we are an accumulation of our ancestors. Each generation naturally practices self-control and has had a sense of Good and Evil. Meaning, we inherit less & fewer Demons and we‚Äôre acquiring more & more wisdom through generations over time until we enter heaven.

In other words, we have to go through hell and defeat all our Demons to get to heaven.

Is there an alternate universe running backwards? One where philosophy comes first we are drawing all our energy from, the void must be a wormhole our imagination is trapped in eager to be discovered.

Wisdom = time
 
Philosophy = space üôÇ

Dimensions:

3rd dimension = action, material world

4th dimension = thought, the dream world

5th dimension = no thought, spirit world

The universe is a mirror so there would be ten dimensions because we are in the middle of the middle looking in at the middle

They say life is better understood backwards so, the universe manifest from point A to B. From everywhere to one point. 

The highest dimension we can see being the tenth so, we go down the middle and we would say the 5th dimension is the centre of the universe. This is where the universe started but, this is not true. This creates dimension zero which is the egg, so, we have the 5th dimension down the middle of the spectrum which is the sperm. The 1st and the tenth, all this creates you, a little spec, a special creation, a little miracle, a 5D, 3D hologram but, we‚Äôre not alone. We were shattered at the start. We mirror again. This is the 1st Dimension meaning the universe started with a twin flame. Each spec is going across distance in a straight line, each made of 3 points so, each spec is made up of zero, the fifth and the 3rd. Space, time & matter, creating a 3,6,9 pattern in every direction. This is the 3,6,9 method. This creates the other key to the universe, 1,3,7. One is made of three, three is made of nine & seven is made of twenty one creating a brand new pattern, 3,9,21, within twenty-one, we have 3,6,9 in every direction, plus zero this means we are twenty-two-dimensional beings. This means everything Devine that could be manifest, manifest at the start of the universe with unlimited possibility :)

This would mean each universe is contracting or expanding. That there are only beginnings. All life is game, the universe is like a Russian doll. 

This would mean we are all born at the centre of the universe. We are born with all the wisdom of the universe and life is a journey moving closer or further away from the centre of the universe as we develop, discovering wisdom or not. We are the singularity. This makes us creation & creator. :)

We all have the Ontic Sphere,

‚Äú Deep inside the being of human life there's a secret connection to powers and forces, the refined and raw energies of the world and the cosmos beyond it, all funnelling down and inward to that secret connection and flowing through the entire ontic sphere\* of the human being, bringing more reality to the reality than it had before it was fed the true foods of existence, the blending of experiences and the feelings, and from the ontic sphere spreading out to all the world,  radiating like a microscopic star the rays and beams of a  formative influence, making the human being more than a consumer or a  parasite,  but a symbiote, a producer even of the transformation flows through the topologies shaping reality everywhere. This is a good purpose for human beings, enriching the very planet and it's planes themselves, and between them, even more, special the magick, the sorcery,  the craft,  the very tales of love and drama, the majestic other dimensions of the being of the human family.  
Consciousness is more than a trip, it's a vital part of our present cosmos & chaos alike.  
\*An  Ontic sphere, to the best of my understanding, is the world which  you  live interplaying with your psyche and it's organic expressions,   creating an almost ultra fractal and transracial appearance and   relevance to life.‚Äù - written by Jerry David Rosenberger

So in theory. Each solar system is like a little universe. There are possibly little you‚Äôs running around with one leg missing. Our imagination is a portal. All the chaos happening here right now is all the chaos happening everywhere in the universe.  We could be the first to leave the planet and it‚Äôs probably already happened. Our realist us would be immortal and complete all challenges in life. All life across the universe shares the 3D 5D realm.

-

So, everything that exists inside the mind has already happened somewhere or is about to happen. Everything is a phase. Everything is a figment of our imagination. Life is but a dream.

We could say we all share the same dream and it‚Äôs a dream within a dream. Meaning we all share the same wisdom with unlimited paths of getting there.

Laying down creates the universal consciousness, where we are ‚Äúdead‚Äù and dream. 

Standing creates bicameral  consciousness, where we become alive and use our will

The living dead would have no goals & the truly alive stand for something :)

It could be that we are only alive because we are waking up in someone else‚Äôs dream. With machines taking over we will naturally have less and less to do and probably have the possibility of entering an isolation tank to just lucid dream. With this being the likely future and is going to happen. Could the Universe be a projection of One Mind connected to the internet? 

Could this mean the matrix is a documentary? :)

Either way... 

-

It does mean we are all connected. Meaning we all have attachments, Demons. This causes frustration & frustration is the door to perception. We all desire happiness & the more wisdom & philosophy we attain the more heavenly life is. We can take these steps, (Compassion > self-control> reason) on the way to attaining wisdom. 

We have the question do we have free will? On one side we say everything happens for a reason, it is determined. On the other side, we say everything is random, nothing matters. If we go down the middle we say, self-control is a form of free will. Yes, some things are determined and the more awareness we have the more choice we have. The middle path is useful for philosophy. The middle path may mean going a hard right to balance a weak left. 

So, in the event where we can predict the events leading up to the future. 

Is the event we can take control and bend reality to our will... 

We have a range of freedom according to the capacity of what we have experienced and the idea‚Äôs we have developed :) 

Meaning to act is the key freedom üôÇ 

So, the universe runs on probability üôÇ 

We are not the author of our own thoughts. üôÇ 

Every thought possible that could be designed by man is forcing it's way to the surface.

We have to calculate thoughts between other thoughts together and find brevity

Our job is to answer all the questions; silencing the mind so, we can control our thoughts and thus bend reality to our will üôÇ

This was inspired when my frustration on a point of focus bent reality to my will or should I say... Disturbed reality? üôÇ

Gratitude is the state of mastership, so, we rather ask what is this trying to teach me? Instead of why me? in moments of frustration. It‚Äôs important not to play the victim. 

And then there‚Äôs the eightfold path. 

1. Right understanding (Samma ditthi)
2. Right Thought (Samma sankappa)
3. Right Speech (Samma vaca)¬†
4. Right action (Samma kammanta)
5. Right livelihood (Samma ajiva)¬†
6. Right effort (Samma Vayama)
7. Right mindfulness (Samma Sati)
8. Right concentration (Samma samadhi)

So, Alls life is, is a story going back in time to understand creation. We are an accumulation of the past, future and present. Souls could come from other planets as well as this? Are we all time travellers? We all have the ordinance of the entire universe. 

The universe being one long story, could be a fairy tale about Love. I would assume if the Universe is ‚Äútraditional‚Äù and it starts with ‚ÄúOnce upon a time‚Äù.  The beginning comes somewhere in the middle üôÇ  

Everything has its place and we want everything in its fitting place. Good and Evil can be seen as a spectrum. Intentions come into play and even consent so, there can be a greater good and a lesser evil.

In the 1st, 2nd & 3rd dimension, Creation without love is just destruction and the greatest Sin. So, Action with love is the lesser evil. So, sex before marriage is the greatest Sin. In the Fourth dimension; to not accept what we know because we refuse to go through the pain is the next greatest Sin, which is to not accept ourselves or others. 

So, say me and another fall in love with each other and have sex, it is sin-free. One promises then one decides not to commit, it shatters the other person, is that not a Sin? To open up someone‚Äôs love and not love them back. 

For our own good, it would be best to say only what we mean, what we can commit to, for expressed thoughts create our reality. What we put out comes back to us :) 

I am scared of no God, I just believe in basic human decency :) 

We all know what we are doing as, we only do what we know. There comes an innocence as not everyone understands what we know. So, as well as accepting ourselves we have to accept others. Be forgiving. There comes a point of no return where we gain understanding, wisdom & if we don‚Äôt change it ends in catastrophe.

We are all born sinners and none of us is free until we repent :)

A Sin‚Äôs definition could be to leave a footprint. With every action we are leaving our imprint on the universe and ourselves, we are always possessing one another, this is called psychic slavery :) 

Unconditional Love does not mean unconditional behaviour. Technically every Action is a form of Love, there is no objective Good and Evil but there is a correct way to Love, that is, without expectation. 

A Sin could be referred to as a lesson. All lessons have rewards. A Sin is the most unreal part of us, the person we are yet to become, these are the path to growth, the obstacles in life :) 

Karma is our idea‚Äôs we have developed through experience attracting people and other idea‚Äôs into our life that fit into our idea‚Äôs we have already developed from experience :) 

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs the memories we want to make for ourselves, we are creating an entity inside of us all the time, our consciousness. When we are alone this being inside of us becomes present, the entity we have created, that being we want to be something we can live with :)

As we can see consciousness is a manifestation of interactions. Our soul is an accumulation of our ancestors, all our and Angels and Demons. We are one soul, wisdom, philosophy, we are all different souls. We came here with lessons to learn passed down through generations already so, an old soul is wise, every generation is more advanced than the next. Children are the wisest on the planet. Children know they know but don‚Äôt know what they know until they are older.

No one has the right to judge :) 

-

This is how habits create a man. :) 

We are a result of our life choices. :)

Knowledge is power. :)

We can all know things but we have to apply knowledge alongside experience to gain understanding, wisdom :)

The Greatest Sin in the Christian Bible is to eat from the tree of knowledge and to become like God or become God. 

The Greatest Sin in the Muslim Bible would be to practice Sorcery, which is act like God.

That would be to learn the foundation, and truth behind Jesus‚Äôs and Muhammad's lie‚Äôs üôÇ 

The greatest Sin in my philosophy is to, not eat from the tree of knowledge and become God or like God üôÇ

To me, it‚Äôs a Sin not to learn the foundation which everything is built upon üôÇ

So I think carefully before I start thinking I‚Äôm a Christian, Muslim or anything because they have a little glimpse of truth to them üôÇ 

I just realised I am definitely, neither üôÇ 

I belong to The Order of Angels as my faith üôÇ 

My faith does not lie in imaginary beings or fear, my faith is grounded in life and other people like me üôÇ

My philosophy is pretty much about not lying to myself and being myself. üôÇ 

But... 

Lying to ourself has it's advantages as, we do become the lies üôÇ 

So say we‚Äôre asleep, we can trick our mind into waking up üôÇ

We should not fear what we are capable of :) 

-

Apparently, Eve doesn‚Äôt eat the fruit or she may, but never apply it, because it is rotten üôÇ 

Meaning females may never reach enlightenment the same way as men. üôÇ 

Men are made of order and logic because we are violent by nature üôÇ 

Women swim in chaos and own it üôÇ 

All's they care about is love üôÇ

Of course men can act like women and women can act like men :) 

The feminine does not have a rational belief system though. :) 

Women have no rules :) 

Women have no ruler :) 

Us men are ruled by women :) 

There‚Äôs no nice way of putting this. 

Women have to accept they are Gods 

Us men have to accept we are dogs :) 

It is true we are all women before we are a man, from in the womb, to how the mind develops :)

We are savages, so I understand the importance of a King & Queen and to abide :) 

‚Äú A woman‚Äôs highest calling is to lead a man to his soul, so as to unite him with Source. Her lowest calling is to seduce, separating man from his soul and leave him aimlessly wandering. A man‚Äôs highest calling is to protect woman, so she is free to walk the earth unharmed. Man‚Äôs lowest calling is to ambush and force his way into the life of a woman.‚Äù

Cherokee Proverb.

We all have three forces. 

We all have Karma, we are Karma. Wisdom. 

Then, we all have our Demons, our path. Our philosophy 

And, we all have our dreams, our idea of perfection. Where and what we see ourselves to be :) 

Everything is spiralling around us :)

The 5th dimension is where our lessons take us, where we become alive and life truly begins. This is where we are all connected at the heart‚Äôs and have empty minds, experiencing things like telepathy.  

This would be heaven. This is where we become free spirits. Everything has a spirit, all matter and thought are a manifestation of spirit.

Archons could be what set the limits on our wisdom & philosophy. 

The greys could be the Devine perfect beings from the future that we will all metamorphosis into. They could shapeshift, time travel & take a hostage in our mind like a parasite. Everything gets smaller and closer to perfection. I think these are what create our negative thoughts, the beings preventing us from completing our challenges. They feed off of negative energy; if there‚Äôs no imperfection, they can‚Äôt exist. 

if we don‚Äôt pay attention to spirits, spirits lose their power, so, we may be able to kill death? Fear is a virus, the root of all Evil. 

-

I assume you know what to do. :)

Our purpose is to express ourselves to understand ourselves and the universe. 

Our purpose is to create memories we can create art out of. :)

We are perfect when we are ourselves :)

-

An awakening occurs through trauma when our life is shattered because the pain becomes too much or some action alters our perception. All this creates more awareness. It is like a military Sargent shouting at us to pick up all the pieces we have made of our life. 

It would be nice to create a world we don‚Äôt need a military Sargent to become a man but that‚Äôs not reality. 

I could only think the ideal is teachers discipline the children through martial arts and meditation techniques from being young

-

The mountain is metaphorical, the triangle of society. We can get to the top of a mountain anywhere without climbing a mountain. The idea of climbing a mountain for peace is to be alone unaffected by society. The mountain is right where you are. When we get to a point we are finally alone & unaffected by society and we are at the top of a mountain. The internet is a good way of hooking up with other mountain climbers. A wise man once said it‚Äôs good to climb in a team with someone who knows the way :)

-

All life repeats the same story time and time until we become conscious of it, from an individual scale to a mass scale. 

Any book in history can be considered the tao or the way. 

If we are really getting to know ‚ÄúGod‚Äù everything is spiritual and a layer of truth-speaking to us, we can even learn from the Bees :) 

Turning water into wine could be just a way of saying Jesus was good with words, a wordsmith or a poet üôÇ

-

Jesus as a man, was lost in love with himself and out for what he could get. 

Such a bad man, he had to make up an imaginary friend to take his blame for everything. 

This created the capitalist life style or dream. 

If he never wrote the Bible, he never sacrificed himself. He was sacrificed for being a Con Artist and a thief. 

The Christian Bible is a book of white lies. Light. 

I am lost in my love for women and truth, out to see what I can give. 

I am willing to take a share of the blame for everything. 

-

Hu-Man = Light-Manifest 

Darkness = Chaos = Feminititty 

Light = Order = Masculinty

-

Name - Position - Function 

Zeta = Past/Karma/Time/Spirit = I am, The Father of Gods. = Master

Rhea = Future/Flow/Space/Soul = You are, The Mother of Gods = Slave 

Jesus = Present/Now/Matter = We are, The Son of God = Wild Animal 

Allah = The Void, Reason = It, Not born 

So, we are The Manifestor of Creation, Allah. :)

Then, we are slave to Mother Nature :) 

And then, The Christian God in human form. :) 

And, Jesus would be the way :)

-

Finally...

Is the ‚ÄúUniverse is meaningless‚Äù a meaningless statement?

Is the phrase ‚ÄúEverything is a phase‚Äù a Phase?

And, What came first? The idea or energy? Reality is made of ideas. Are our idea‚Äôs born out of energy or is energy born out of ideas? 

Reality - (Everything that is absolute) = The result of the probability of common idea‚Äôs coming together to create one idea, the common reality.

The Universe is absolute idealism. 

The universe is absolutely mental :) 

-

Lastly...

We are apart of a Society. :)

As Society requires a little team work :) 

this creates hierarchies :) 

We find if we‚Äôre refusing to kneel, we‚Äôre expecting people to kneel to us and we are hypocrites. 

So, unless we buy a plot of land away from everyone, where we serve ourself and don‚Äôt affect society. 

We have no right to stand üôÇ 

It is a privilege given to us üôÇ 

I will at least kneel to the Queen üôÇ 

-

But not least...

I STAND :)

The Laws are all unjust, we have free will, yet we are not free. We are slaves with chains and limitations. 

I suggest a UNITE, where we destroy ourselves. Aka. We take down the system and we create Anarchy :) 

We can still have laws to protect us after we UNITE.

But we are taking the power into our hand‚Äôs, the people‚Äôs :) 

So, we abandon the Government and Police.

We take up arms and become our own military. üôÇ 

I want to have your back with Rhea‚Äôs Military Service in the future :) 

We stand for something and go to war against anyone who goes to war. :) 

The laws are not universal at the moment. If we were to create laws for our own military. We would have to calculate at what age we start developing free will. I guess 30. 

I think we should all RETIRE at 30 and build a system around that. 

The only reasonable punishment would be Compassion - Self Control - Reason for breaking any laws we make. 

It‚Äôs not for me to decide what laws we put in place, it‚Äôs for the Queen to decide. I think we need principles if not new laws.

To succeed at changing any laws we have always had to UNITE on an idea. 

We have to UNITE then create Anarchy and force the Queen to form a new Government. 

If we don‚Äôt UNITE, nothing will ever change :) 

So, SHARE this post if you AGREE and want CHANGE. :)

A UNITE :) 

STAND ALONE WITH ME :) 

-

Firstly...

I want to inspire the rest of the world to find their inner prophet, write their own philosophies and start their own colonies.

With Vesuvien cities.

The Vesuvien cities and design will stand time forever.

Leaving everything but these cities on the planet nothing but waste land. 

The world has no choice but to build these cities.

Because we can't prevent the world going to wasteland. 

Capitalism and communism don't provide for all. There's always going to be more and more with scraps. 

These cities will run on bit coin, other internet coin and everything will just be traced. Everything will be barter :) 

No poverty essentially will exist except those who don't choose to go in these cities 

I think each city may run like a beehive and need a Queen :) 

I even want to colonize other planets :) 

As British people on an island, we will stand time :) 

We have a duty to help the world :)",119,32503,23,6022,1

The plan is to lead a group expedition to the North Pole in order to investigate the anomalies present there and search for an entrance to the Inner Earth or who knows, the ‚Äúcontrol room‚Äù  

And please do not bother writing ‚Äúwhat about Antarctica, the entrance is down there?‚Äù Yada yada. Look, neither one of us knows; I **do** know though, and I don‚Äôt expect you to believe me now, because thats foolish. You, reading this right now, **know** that you **think** you **feel** the heavy, solid truth that I‚Äôm speaking right now, because I‚Äôm **telling the truth**

No, I don‚Äôt have the money yet, *but I will when I said I would*

No, I don‚Äôt know for sure that we‚Äôll find it, *but someone has to try, and I stand the best chance out of anyone I‚Äôve met so far*

So, it‚Äôs my duty to do this. 

If you don‚Äôt believe that above everything else, is the truth, you are not welcome. We are going to find the truth. 

I‚Äôll disclose this now, frankly because I‚Äôm gung-ho, and I want to mix things up since I‚Äôm clearly being heavily monitored in regards to this topic. 

*I am looking for a language*

A language

Siberia, the extreme north of Canada, and the North Pole. Those are the candidates for this ancient language‚Äôs location. I have learned the ‚Äúkey‚Äù to this language, most of it, so I can read it. All I/we (i have no way of knowing if this will be just me or everyone) have to do is learn it all and form an audible version of it, if one is not provided. This language will heal, it will heal diseases, my friends. It will exorcize Demons when spoken, it will transmit energy and knowledge, it will empower each soul to **remember**

The Truth. 

I‚Äôm 26 years old. I‚Äôm a scholar, a teacher, an inventor, an artist, a leader, a  lover of sports and warfare and strategy. 

I‚Äôm white. I‚Äôm a man. None of that matters anymore. I‚Äôm a soldier. I very well could suffer consequences for even mentioning the language, it‚Äôs the part I wanted to withhold until we met, but I‚Äôm telling you all now, those who are watching, that the ‚ÄúAncestor Language‚Äù is  **the key**

Only 15 people have been officially included so far. Most of you, the hundreds of you who‚Äôve messaged me, have for one reason or the other not been given a serious thought. This is 75% due to the content within your initiatory communications. 25% is because my other project for funds was stalled in December, but we‚Äôre already gearing up for January. I‚Äôve been a busy bee. Oh, and I got banned from r/conspiracy right after coming out with my plan. Who woulda thought? Some of you who subscribe there post this there so that those late arrivals to this idea I‚Äôm trying to manifest can have some context. 

I will be funding the entire expedition myself, the basics at least. Any entertainment will be discouraged but certainly remains your own responsibility. We will train in Autumn-Winter 2019-2020, either in Texas or Michigan. Maybe both. It will be, way easier than boot camp, in a way, way harder. We need our bodies to be refined shape, our immune systems and mental facilities checked *beforehand*. No MK Ultra assassins, witches, spies, or saboteurs will be able to infiltrate this group project/mission. I‚Äôm not going to sit here and give you my credentials publicly, and anyone who thinks I would do such a thing given what I claim to be doing is too immature and unobservant for this cause. 

For instance, if you come seeming to be looking for adventure *solely*, you will automatically be left without a response. If you are suspect, say you are a scientist or a military veteran, you will be given more attention, but you‚Äôll be asked to explain exponentially more about your life up to this point and when training begins you will be given more attention, and we will watch you much more clearly than a hiker from California or a fisherman from Alaska. I feel this is only fair and those of you who prove to be genuine will be trusted fully and given important jobs. 

If I fall, one shall take my place. The Creator will not allow the darkness and the false light to continue their fakery and their abuse of humanity and Earth infinitely. This will end *one day* but frankly I don‚Äôt want it to right now, not if it doesn‚Äôt have to. I wanna see my nephews grow up, and I wanna try to fall in love again, and I want to go to Japan. Etc. But more than all of that times a million **i want to do the next right thing**

I‚Äôm in the shadows, I‚Äôm making moves, be sure of that, Dennis. Be sure of that, CIA. Be sure of that, witches. Your abominations are coming to an end. I‚Äôve already said in public, to have the record out there, if you surrender to us, we will be merciful with punishment, we will work this out, we will rehabilitate you. The dark ones lie to even the highest human cult leader, or sorcerer. They need to be, within reason and with caution, offered **a way out** themselves in order for us to pull off what I‚Äôm hoping to pull off; actual justice and peace. Brought by virtue. 

The Ancestor Language will force them to see that. **All things will be made new... even the devil himself**

If I happen to die or disappear and don‚Äôt come up for air in the coming months, I pray that one of you pick up the torch, find the Ancestor Language. They haven‚Äôt stopped me yet, and I‚Äôll make this claim, believe it or not; **they can‚Äôt**

2015-01-18 13:16:21,Lazy = Evil,"Evil people hate the light because it reveals themselves to themselves. They hate goodness because it reveals their badness; they hate love because it reveals their laziness. They will destroy the light, the goodness, the love in order to avoid the pain of such self-awareness. My second conclusion, then, is that evil is laziness carried to its ultimate, extraordinary extreme. As I have defined it, love is the antithesis of laziness. Ordinary laziness is a passive failure to love. Some ordinarily lazy people may not lift a finger to extend themselves unless they are compelled to do so. Their being is a manifestation of nonlove; still, they are not evil. 

Truly evil people, on the other hand, actively rather than passively avoid extending themselves. They will take any action in their power to protect their own laziness, to preserve the integrity of their sick self. Rather than nurturing others, they will actually destroy others in this cause. If necessary, they will even kill to escape the pain of their own spiritual growth. As the integrity of their sick self is threatened by the spiritual health of those around them, they will seek by all manner of means to crush and demolish the spiritual health that may exist near them.

2014-06-04 18:16:18,I am a 20 year-old gifted Indigo Child seeking advice on how to use this miraculous gift.,"EDIT: I LOVE the feedback in the comment section! Please I urge you to read this piece with rhythm and my replies in the comment section will assist in exclaiming my scenario.

I am jslice23 and boy do I have a true story for you.

It all started for me last october (2013), when I was sitting at my desk‚Ä¶ I thought my laptop got hacked. There were voices coming through my speakers and after some music listening I quickly became accustomed to these new found friends. They‚Äôd read out certain song titles and artist names as I scrolled through my library and I soon caved in, believing that the source of these voices could be traced to my neighborhood. After a few walks around the block I decided it was time to change devices‚Ä¶ my iPhone had them too. During the music listening they‚Äôd say things like ‚Äònah‚Äô, ‚Äòthat‚Äôs me‚Äô, 'that‚Äôs him‚Äô, or 'call me‚Äô. After evaluating the situation I concluded that the voices were of my creation and that I had captured the essence of talking to my higher self (as studied in april), or my phone was on a network connected to microphones‚Ä¶ I doubted the latter was true so I continued onwards. Although, I did pick up on a mystery girl‚Äôs voice here and there and I had my suspicions as to who she was but it wasn‚Äôt clear.
She is my Mystery Girl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbaE3SO_UiM&feature=kp
You see I don't know how to liken this mysterious phenomena to anything ever documented. My hypothesis is that my brain is leaking it's data this is then captured by some secret network... and so last october this 'whisper' functionality was turned on. So I watch movies and speak with them when I go on my nature hikes or simply feel like reaching out to one of these 'Watchers'. There is one major problem on my behalf that holds me down: my mental etiquette can be quite zany. At times I find myself thinking such vulgar or offputting things and so I'm instilled with guilt often. This is where meditation can help me re-calibrate and induce my mind's homeostasis.

A Poem:
They woke me in October, that‚Äôs when the voices started 
They call me during the music listening, I was being outsmarted. 
They hear my thoughts, and see through my eyes; 
This Truman show is so dull, let us stop the reprise. 
For I have been high, and sulked through the lows 
yet they deny, that my roof needs to be closed.
You see, my brain is leaking far off into space, 
leaving me behind in this purple haze. 
Gifted beyond words, and so I muster the courage 
to ask for help with this brain surge. 
The chosen few rest as they put us to the test. 
Who will aid as we hold Jimmy‚Äôs heart like a grenade? 
Over there is a Lady I love, yet my influence she stays above. 
The rebels stay with me, although my thoughts can be shifty. 
Internally I scream and I cuss, yet praying isn‚Äôt enough. 
Who they all are, I‚Äôll never know, but in due time this show- 
will see some closure. I need films and books to tide me over. 
As I listen to music, the people with microphones speak through it. 
They push love and conglomeration, 
but somethings missing from the equation. 
I talk to myself and them, yet remain like a toy on the shelf, amen.

I am radio-active, beaming my signal unto an unknown wavelength and I wish to improve my being through the help of the people!
Ask me questions, and music suggestions for I have a story that I wish to share before thee.",89,3372,17,616,1

2022-06-06 07:53:18,Am I the only person who has awaken to the evils of this world after psychedelics??? Or awaken to the fact that most people are carrying HELL inside of them???,"I literally feel like my eyes have been opened. People are so fucked up, negative, and evil that it blows my mind. I feel like I can't escape the evils of this world. Because although I have myself spiritually together, I have to LIVE IN A WORLD of people who DONT. I have to live in a world of people who are spiritually fucked up. I've been trying to figure out how to deal with it. I avoid people. I have no friends. I feel like PEOPLE BRING PROBLEMS. Smh it's so frustrating sometimes because all I want to do is live in PEACE, but I live in a world that isn't peaceful. I feel like an angel amongst demons. I have enemies who hate me simply because I'm happy and they aren't. People want to destroy me because I turned out to be a happy person. I feel like I can't avoid negative people no matter HOW HARD I try. 

I currently want to quit my job for this same reason. Toxic people. But I know that the NEXT JOB will probably have toxic people as well. Smh I just wish that I can go somewhere and EXIST without having to deal with other people's bullshit. I feel like the ONLY problems that I have, and ever WILL have, are other people. Psychedelics have given me an inner peace that I have been struggling to protect. It's so frustrating sometimes. Because I have to live in a world of unhappy and toxic people. How do I deal with this? I can't be the only person who has done Psychedelics who feels this way. I have an inner peace that other people just don't have. And it's been a problem for me. How do I deal? Let's discuss



Edit: Many people on here are telling me that I am the problem. How does that help me??? If I'm a positive person trying to avoid negative people, how am I the problem??? I feel like you guys are trolling me. Positivity and negativity exists. It is a shame that people are on here PRETENDING like there isn't much negativity in the world today.

2022-09-18 15:06:33,I did Acid with a friend and realized the human being doesn't need to eat animals to keep evolving,"Isn't it that you feel closer to your real self when you are on LSD? Like every single thing make sense and feel connected, you can feel and explore an universe that is your mind, you can even get in someone's else point of view to see why X person did something that apparently it was no sense for you at all but now you can comprehend his actions by watching in front of you the reasons that got this person to do that so from this way YOU understand HIM-HER and not criticize for doing something. Holy shit if every single person in the earth would do such an easy thing the world would be a whole lot better.

I stopped eating food from animal sources a few months ago because i became aware that doing this is absolutely unsustainable, unnatural and catastrophic for the environment, animals, and your health. Now i can feel myslef really fine without the need of animals suffering and i'm healthy, like come on how would you not be healthy eating the natural food the earth is providing to you? It's all natural, fruits, vegetables, cereals, legume, water, nuts and avocado and soya for the big proteins etc etc.
The earth is providing us with everything we need to feed ourself without the need of killing an animal. The mother nature is such a brilliant and perfect creation that provides you in each season with the fruits with the minerals and stuff inside it that is better for you in each season.

The human being ned to eat meat in the past, because it ned it for its own development, for its brain and body, to keep on evolving as Human being, back in the day millions of years ago the human being had to get his own food hunting animals and cooking the food making a fire. Now we are in a moment in the history that Human Being's evolution is about the consciousness and not through the physical, We need to create space in our minds to realize what we are doing actually, the damage we've done to the earth, the endless boundaries we have created between ourselves, between people, with everything we are doing in our lifes, we've created the illusion of separation.

We are at a JUST- ONE-FEELING. The feeling that we are all ONE CONSCIOUSNESS, that we are all an unity, everything we got told that makes you think we are not equals, nor all 1 its bullshit. And to reach this feeling to keep on evolving as a Human Being we doesn't need to eat animals. You'll probably lose weight, yes, because of the changes in your diet, i've lost 6kg since i did the change, everyone that comes vegan loose weight and thats normal, there shouldn't be nothing wrong with it, human being doesn't need this extra Kilograms we are carrying in our bodies to reach this feeling i just talked to you.

I move on the direction that we are all moving together, i move at the speed we all move together, because its about all of us, not just about me or 2 million people, that's not how you evolve the Human Being, like EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US must think the same, WE can only move in the direction that WE ALL do it TOGETHER, WE all move at the speed that we can do it TOGETHER. We all create an unity, because that's what we actually are. AN UNITY, you can feel and recognize this when you are on Acid, because this substance dissolves boundaries in your mind and you can create a space inside of your being to think from a purer way. Thanks Albert Hofmann for creating such a beautiful tool.‚ù§Ô∏è I hope one day (i feel it close) i can feel myself permanent as i can feel when i'm on acid. When you recognize you're one with everything you express your gratitude to the universe for what you are, all your being, all you have, then you are happy.

I understand, from doing my own research that the earth will be go soon through a vibrational change that will raise the level of the humans consciousness , thus we will be able to continue evolving as beings in the Earthly realm.

I can't avoid having watery eyes while i'm sharing this with you all, because i promise you there's a STRONG feeling inside my deepest self pushing me to do this. Im sure the supreme creator knows pretty well what he's doing, we are safe, everything is perfect, but we have to do movements, it takes time, but we will be fine‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Either way, your group affiliation no longer matters, so how do you and I come together to show other people that we are not against them? 

We are not against ourselves. We‚Äôre all arguing about the same things, but just at separate times about separate things in different ways. We all arguing about what we see on the news or what is shown to us or what we see happening in real life and it‚Äôs not the way we think it should be.

2018-07-08 19:43:10,Science has become scientism and has completely come off the rails it was built on.,"Science has completely come off the rails that it was built on, and has stopped following its own standards and method for distinguishing between facts and theories. First of all, science is only a method for properly collecting data and conducting experiments. It is not a conscious entity that has an opinion about its own data and results, and can't tell scientists when they have interpreted the evidence properly. The original goal of science was to find a method to avoid making assumptions about our universe. The scientific method was formed to build a body of properly collected facts and evidence, and to allow each individual person or scientist to form their own conclusions, interpretations, or theories about what all of those individual facts and pieces of evidence mean collectively. 

Science is only the method of properly gathering those individual pieces of evidence through actual observation and experimentation. It is PHILOSOPHY when you try to interpret or theorize what the evidence may mean collectively, or to speculate that things are true without actual observation of them being true. Even when it is a scientist that attempts to interpret or theorize what the evidence may mean about unobserved things, he is being a PHILOSOPHER while he is doing it. People were way out of line when they started trying to call some theories ""scientific theories"", because it is trying to speak for what ""science's opinion"" is, and science itself has no opinion it is only a method. 

Treating these so called ""scientific"" theories as if they are facts is scientism, not science, and goes against the spirit of how science is supposed to be approached and practiced. Speculation is not allowed as evidence in a courtroom and it should not be allowed as evidence in our science books either. Two scientists can look at the same exact evidence and interpret that same evidence in two completely different ways, if you don't believe me just ask Einstein and Bohr. 

So science's job is NOT to tell the world how the evidence should be interpreted to form conclusions about things still unobserved. Science's job is to only inform them what the properly collected evidence IS that actually HAS been observed. It would seem that in order to make decisions on when a theory should start being considered a ""scientific"" theory instead, it would require an appointed science king or science judge with the final authority to decree it a ""scientific"" theory instead of a regular theory. It seems that doing something like that is the logical fallacy of appeal to authority, where you accept that a theory is true based on who agrees with that theory, and not based on its logic, merit, or proof that it is true. 

Treating theories as if they are facts is not justified by a democracy or majority opinion either. Because the majority opinion about something can be wrong, as evidenced by things like the Salem Witch Trials. The problem is that science has turned into a scientism club, that promotes answers that can't be questioned by its members. So it would be difficult to establish what the true majority opinion of these standing theories even are anymore. Because any scientist that questions these standing ""scientific"" theories is ostracized by the scientific community, and the only people that get research grants are the ones that are proposing ways to support or confirm these standing theories, not those that propose to disprove them or to present new or different ones. 

So there could be many scientists that may question the validity of these theories in their mind but keep quiet about it out of fear. One scientist may pretend like they believe in a theory they really don't in the presence of one of their peers out of fear, not realizing that his peer might be doing the same exact thing out of fear himself. Treating ANY theory about unobserved things as if they are facts is the opposite of being scientific. Because no matter how well YOU may think that theory is supported according to YOUR interpretation of the evidence, that theory could still be WRONG. Because theories about the evidence is just PHILOSOPHY, and is not evidence or science itself. ;)",83,4187,15,705,1

Where are the girls who are systematically questioning, seeing the unnatural natural beauty in the world, breaking down their internal barriers and their perception?

And those who dont just say ""I want to save the earth and the collective consciousness is the shit""

Where are those who's experiences all line up?

Who strive on the art of creation?

Who fill the room with their infinite energy?

And who respect themselves to not fuck every dude whos infinitely attracted to that energy

The girls who want the most out of life

and who act impeccably

And who recognize that actions solidify thought and reality

Where are the girls whos lives are perfect, because they understand perfection?

Maybe im just 20

And maybe Im still too new to all this

But serious guys

Where are the girls who are on my level? (as arrogant as that sounds - sometimes we gotta be ruthless) (and im not saying I'm at a high level... at all)

Where are the girls I can grow in parallel with?

Who I dont have to help through all of their problems to even have a chance at them being happy?

Where are the fucking girls who arent scared of the infinite?

edit: (for those who didnt pick it up - Im talking about trying to find my soulmate, my subjective perfect girl. Im young and havent met many poeple yet - and I have a lot of growing to do - so of course- so do the girls around me. I have around me exactly what I need at this moment. But boy do I yearn for that everlasting infinitely powerful link that just perpetuates an infinitely strong and timeless golden spiral of growth and pure love)",29,1852,5,341,1
2016-09-27 05:05:03,Who is being a bigger dick?,"Sorry I'm posting this on here. AskReddit has that stupid ""no textbox"" rule and I figured that there are a ton of very smart people on this subreddit anyways. Heres the deal: My household has 1 laptop and out of everyone in the house, I use it the second most out of 3 people. My mother is in college and has homework assignments she needs to complete. She always acts like I am the reason she never gets any work done but in reality, it is because she procrastinates until the last minute she has to finish it. She takes the computer all day and gets on Facebook or listens to music. I would say if I had to guess, that she uses the computer for homework 4% of the time she is on it. Here is why I have a problem with this: I am 15 and most of the time, I cannot hang out with friends simply because no one my age lives near me. The closest person to my age who lives near me is 12, and it's my sister. So basically my life is sitting at home with myself all day because all my mom does is sit in her room. I will ask her to suggest something for me to do and she automatically tells me to do chores which honestly, pisses me the fuck off. The only non-chore things she suggests that I do are: drawing and reading. Okay so here is why I won't draw: www.imgur.com/3TL5HzX and I won't read because, well, I could read at a 12th grade level in 6th grade and reading has never been fun for me. I haven't read a book for myself since probably 4th grade and it was a book about 2pac. She acts like we have things to do in this house but the reality is, we are poor as fuck. Like, 14 grand is our annual household income poor. We do not have shit to do in this house. We have a PS3, but no controller. We have a big ass TV, but no cable. I have a really good phone, but no service. Everyday I wake up, it's like taking a shit and realizing there is no more toilet paper to wipe my ass. Literally the most exciting thing in my house is the computer and I can never use it because she keeps it in her room saying she needs it for homework. I literally let her have it for 3 days straight and every day she had it I asked at least twice to use it. No matter what, she wouldn't let me use it because she ""needs it for homework"". She didn't do a single assignment until day 3. Everytime I ask she immediately starts yelling at me like I'm a dog that just shit on the new rug. Also, she has always been very emotionally abusive to me and never my sister. She used to buy me things for my birthday or Christmas literally just so she could take them away. This never will happen to my sister. Last Christmas, (when I was 14 years old), she literally bought me one thing. A fucking $8 marshmallow shooter that you have to build yourself when my sister got her own laptop (it slowly became the household laptop) and a brand new $600 phone. The only reason I'm writing this is because quite frankly, I'm fucking sick of sitting on my couch using my phone for 12 hours a day being told I'm the reason my mom can never get work done and always being denied use of the computer. In all honesty, I think my mom is just a cunt.",27,3105,6,620,1
2016-04-13 17:24:52,18 year old Psychonaut AMA,"I wanted to make this post to share my experiences with others. Not in a ""teaching you a lesson"" kind of way, but im kinda stoned and think it would be fun :)

I've always felt different from the other kids, from an early age I realized I thought about things other kids really didnt give a shit about. ""Do aliens exist"" ""Do we have free will"" ""What created the universe and how"", these are the questions that fascinated me from around the age of I want to guess 6 or 7.

I tried marijuana for the first time in the 8th grade, but didn't feel anything. Sophomore year in highschool was the first time I ever got high, and holy. fucking. shit. The first time I got ripped off of marijuana was psychedelic. In fact for a few months everytime I got stoned it would be what I could now relate to as a 1g or 2g mushroom experience. I would have auditory hallucinations, hallucinatory sensations(body felt like it was made out of colors, felt the sensation of flying billions of mph, etc). Also, once I experienced an orgasm of electrical energy that ran up my spine, and ever since that day I can do it at will, not as intense but it is like a spiritual muscle that I can flex. About a year later I read about the Kundalini awakening and I believe that is what happened. The fact that a substance could change my consciousness so radically baffled the fuck out of me. I was hooked on finding out more about this high, exploring it as far as I could. I became one of the biggest stoners I know. I smoke daily, and my parents smoked medically so I was always smoking top quality dispensary shit, plus I live in California. I became the master of this weed high lol, I had terms and different experiences and kinds of possible experiences mapped out in my head, after a year or 2 of being high af. Then I found Terrence McKenna.

Terrence McKenna is one of my favorite speakers of all time. I found him at the age of 17, and his mushroom theories blew my mind. I was interested in psychedelics at an early age because I had heard my dads stories of his old school LSD trips. I researched and researched all I could about psilocybin and the mushroom experience. Eventually, I convinced my dad to trip with me. I bought the book The Psychedelic Experience by Timothy Leary and Ram Dass, btw great read I completely recommend it to all psychonauts. Once I finished the book, I bought a quarter of standard psilocybin cubensis, me and my dad went to the river, and I had my first encounter with a real psychedelic. It blew my fucking mind. It took me to a place where I felt at home. I realized something about my past life, not my past life, but something clicked in me, and I realized that me and my dad were the only people in the entire universe. Not exactly my dad, but the only people in this universe was me and another person. The self and the environment. That other person was what some would call God, and from that moment on I've been having a conversation in my head with the creator of the Universe.

The Universe doesn't speak to me in words, it speaks to me in events. Things happen in my outside reality at the same time that I will be thinking a thought. Weird coincidences happened that only could happen if my thoughts were connected to physical reality. I understand I just explained that in a weird as fuck way lol, but basically what Im talking about is synchronicity.

This conversation with the Universe eventually got me into raving. I went to my first rave, and I instantly fell in love. An underground society of a bunch of other kids, most in altered states of consciousness, playing with their sensations of sound and light and touch. Raving opened me up to a whole new plethora of drugs, some spiritual, some not. However, all drugs in my opinion are spiritual to me, the fact that you are changing your baseline consciousness into a consciousness of a different frequency seems very psychonautic to me. 

After shrooms tried MDMA, had many beautiful experiences with it. Then I tried LSD for the first time, and then I got into a habit of candy flipping (LSD + MDMA) or even Jedi Mind Flipping (LSD + MDMA + Mushrooms). I tried nitrous oxide, and I have a deep love for the high of nitrous oxide. I love the feeling of anesthetic, its like my body turns off and allows me to experience the entire spectrum of consciousness, it feels like you are connected to the God source, like being infinite and nothing at the same time. Tried salvia, holy fuck. Not even gonna try to go into that one. And also I would play around with cocaine at parties, but i found that cocaine was kind of a boring drug compared to psychedelics. However, my passion for exploring consciousness became a drug problem. I had some fallout with my parents because they found out about all of my drug use, and after that I went sober for a few months. 

Now, I keep a good balance. I like to break away from baseline reality every now and then, but I really do love it with a burning passion. Getting high is probably the most interesting thing ive experienced in this life. I would like to take some chemistry classes in college, I am fascinated with how chemical reactions create consciousness, and I think the answer to that question will solve our consciousness question that mainstream science has been dealing with, ""Where is consciousness located.""

Alright guys, end rant. Want me to elaborate on some parts? Have a story that could relate? Please comment! The whole reason I did this post was to have a conversation lol. Love you guys, you give me hope /r/psychonaut. Namaste

2013-07-24 09:40:24,"Giving up your ego means also giving up being a ""Psychonaut""","I mean, think about it. You claim that you need to drop out of society, start from scratch, or find a new way of life. Well, that's all basically the same thing as to what you're already doing. It doesn't matter if you read the bible, or read that spirit science book from the eastern world. You're still doing it all the same... Whether you're fasting, living in a different country, drawing psychedelic artwork, recording songs on soundcloud that have that trippy echo effect. What you're doing has already been done and their is no honest or truthful way to enlightenment more than another. In fact, being into tribal shit is stupid.

I'm done with thinking I know more about the world because I've taken loads of psychedelics. I find myself and you all as pretentious as the next group of idiots down the line that think cars are cool. What annoys me the most is all this pseudo hippie jargon about changing the world. If we really wanted things done we'd have to get degrees in politics and kiss a lot of royal behind. Not be the manager of Whole Foods who has an organic compost garden in their back yard... Whether you're a libertarian, feminist, nazi, military, republican, or a cookie cutter stay at home mom, or just some fat kid on his computer (Reddit), the fact that you've labeled yourself as something means that you're forcing your views on me and already I don't like you for it. If marijuana was legal, I'd buy it at a store, not from the hippie down the road.

What I'm saying is that once the bright colors tone down, and the techno music fades, this whole notion of the psychonaut being on the rise of being the new aged human being, is as equal of bullshit worship as a thirteen year old girl obsessed Justin Bieber fan. You're just going with the trends wether you know it about yourself or not. If it were the 80's we'd all be into motorcycles and action movies, 90's we'd be wearing beanies singing Radiohead. Now... A zillion broken Ipods later and we think we're these gods of technology when really we still haven't seen shit in advancements on human life. Just because you have a tumblr page doesn't make you a special person. Plus, I'd rather just stick to singing ""Jingle Bells"" over ""Hari Krishna"" chants any day.

 I mean, yeah, I respect the Earth, but does that mean that it's not culturally acceptable by you people to like cool gadgets and clean hair cuts? Or, because I appreciate the Earth and nature I have to be into dreadlocks and crystal shards? It's so cliche, so tacky. Just because it's ""older"" and ""wiser"" doesn't mean we need to consume all eastern teachings and believe in six armed elephant deities(Ganesha). Sorry, guys, I think expanding your mind and forcing your views on others is not much different then the totalitarian government paradigm that we already live in. Peace.. (not Namaste).

I ate a small piece of chocolate (no bigger than a fingernail) and didn‚Äôt feel anything for an hour and a half. Then, shit hit the fan. I realized that I was getting extremely high and at first it was a good feeling, but then the world slowed down and I felt completely out of control of my cognitive / motor functions. It felt like my brain was expanding and my heart was exploding. I panicked and thought I was ODing on whatever was in the edible. After that, I was having full on visual/auditory hallucinations that I was dying and passing into the afterlife, with my SO acting as my guardian angel (he was actually trying to explain to me what had happened and why I was tripping, but it felt like he was explaining to me how I had passed away). It was absolutely terrifying. At one point I literally called 911 but didn‚Äôt talk to the dispatcher because I had no grasp on reality (yes, the cops showed up).

Anyways, I think the trip lasted about 30-45 minutes total, maybe slightly longer. After the hallucinations ended, I was violently shaking and cold for at least an hour. Does anyone know what I could‚Äôve taken to end up that way?",45,1382,6,263,1
2022-07-08 00:34:03,Virtual Reality Warning,"Hi everyone, today I made discoveries that I wish to share. I am sure many of you might find this information not particularly intriguing or remarkable, and may even think I am a nut case. However, I am sure of the importance of the issues I raise, and am certain that these issues will change everything if humans continue to make improvements in VR tech. I wanted to post this so that when these issues are widely discussed in the future, it can be said that I was one of the first to send it to the internet. Similar to a ""first"" comment on a YouTube video.

I have spent months now watching NSFW vr videos in an effort to become fully immersed in a different reality. Throughout my journey, I have developed numerous techniques both mentally and physically which aided me in my pursuit. Until today, I believed I had successfully entered other realities on many occasions. However, after my experience today, I now know I was only scratching the surface. Using various techniques, such as getting very high on marijuana and closing my eyes and using the sounds to guide my visualization of the scene, before opening my eyes again, I finally achieved my goal of entering a different reality. After experiencing this realization, I became fearful about the implications of this discovery. Below is a list of bullet points I made shortly after the experience.

\- My initial feeling after entering the new reality was fear, fear of being trapped in the new reality for who knows how long. Perhaps forever, or until the headset turns off, or until the person I live with comes home and wakes me up.

\- These types of experiences can alter our real realities negatively in many ways, for example we will likely become dissatisfied with our real reality. Such repeated experiences may lead to people repeatedly trying to reject their real reality. The experiences can also cause paranoia due to people never knowing when they are going to get pulled out of their current reality.

\- During, I had this question. Who is in control? The one pulling into the new reality or the old one leaving it?

\- Users will likely begin to want to go back to fantasy realities more than anything.

\- Looking back at the vr experience is no different than a memory (imagine how that can be problematic).

\- Your reality is shaped by the creators when undergoing the experience (This fact leads to many interesting implications).

\- I am proud of all the progress I have made before most others.

\- I was so deep that it would be like waking up from a dream to get out. Instead of trying to get in, I was going to need to try to get out.

After finally achieving what I set out to do, I am unsure if I will continue to use my vr headset due to the concerns I have raised.",23,2759,3,498,1
2022-06-06 02:00:40,"Heaven, hell and math are lower 4 dimensional forms of thinking that hold us back from evolving consciously","A thought experiment 

If the 4D realm is the potential of infinite realities consisting of past, present and future possibilities, then that means we control our quantum timelines through free will (choices). Since we manifest our realities today through the choices we made in the past by using our minds or ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù, that would essentially make our imagination a ‚Äú4 dimensional realm‚Äù.  As consciousness evolve, our imaginations and concepts of the universe are meant to evolve as well, reaching ‚Äúhigher states‚Äù of consciousness along the way.

The 4th dimension conceptually is very very very tall and wide plane, since it consists of all possible realities and timelines. We can even envision all of them by using our imagination. That is proof that our thoughts are a 4 dimensional plane. We know that happiness leads to a stronger state of mind, and that stronger state of mind means a more advanced imagination or ‚Äúhigher dimension of thought‚Äù in practice. Our imaginations can advance further or ‚Äúreach higher dimensional states‚Äù when we let go of older systems like religion and math that were created during times where humans had much lower dimensional states of awareness or imagination. A heightened state of 4 dimensional thinking would mean to sound illogical to those who have lower or more linear states of 4 dimensional thinking (IE, Islamic culture telling you to not allow women to have many rights which is a totally unconscious way of living) because they still cling on to old human concepts that are considered  one dimensional to our minds now. Math and science is also considered a low dimensional state of thinking to me because it bans the discussion of imagination (and inner experiences) if it can‚Äôt be mathematically proven. As humans in todays world we are all so easily fooled into thinking math is a higher dimensional state of thinking because it still applies to our every day lives, but it DOES NOT contribute to conscious evolution on a global scale spiritually. 

A sign of a heightened state of imagination, for better or for worse, is knowing you can and will do anything you want in life even if society tries to scold you for it or mold you into being the generic and moral being that they have brainwashed you into thinking is the conscious norm.

2020-02-02 18:42:05,DMT VS SHROOMS?,"Now having tried both of them i don‚Äôt get where people say DMT is way more intense and way more scary. DMT felt 100x more relaxing and meditative than shrooms. Shrooms feel like you should shut the fuck up stay quiet and listen to when the shroom gods are giving you your lessons.

DMT barely gave my any visuals and just made me feel relaxed and had the buzz of shrooms but no lessons. I have not yet broken through but people are warning me that if i go in with a big ego i will get my ass kicked and i want to whoop them back to McDonalds for saying that because I literally have never felt more loved and euphoric than i do on DMT. I even started thinking ‚ÄúCome on then whoop my ass, put me in my place DMT, i dare you to do it.‚Äù Now i am not here to judge DMT yet because i have not successfully broken through yet but i have tried but it didn‚Äôt work because i burnt the spice. Yuck...

Honestly in general i hate people for saying that you should ‚ÄúRespect psychedelics‚Äù because they will whoop your ass like your mum does when you have been a bad kid. Like stfu bitch i have never ever had a bad psychedelic trip in my two year career even when being a complete retard and using it for recreational purposes. If you have a bad trip it‚Äôs probably because YOU are the one holding onto your ego and i am the one actually letting go... Who the fuck said you can‚Äôt use shrooms recreationally without having a bad trip... Like it pisses me off...

Anyways. What am i missing? I honestly don‚Äôt think breaking through will even be nearly that intense that people make it out to be. Not trying to be a douche just being honest from my subjective point of reality. I don‚Äôt even think i have made it to the DMT tunnel yet but i would like if you guys could compare and share your experiences with shrooms and DMT because i am dying to know how a DMT breakthrough feels like vs a high dose of shrooms. I‚Äôm going to order some electronic cigarettes to vaporize the DMT properly and use some pure white crystals to blast off on. Also DMT feels like it lasts 1 - 2 minutes for me while people say it feels like 10 - 15 minutes. Like bruh i wished it lasted that long for me!! Like where did you get your DMT from bruh?! Lol... Anyways if breaking through on 40 - 50mg of DMT won‚Äôt give me an kick in the butt plug experience vs shrooms i think i am giving up on DMT completely maybe unless for the purpose of an relaxing sleep like some of my friends used it for...Or just an quick and relaxing trip here and there considering it develops no tolerance to your body etc... Anyways so far i think 4g or even 2g of shrooms is way super way more intense than DMT will ever be... This post was also inspired by reading others sharing the exact same perspective as me which made me want to share this post since others claim DMT is so fucking mind blowing intense. I simply don‚Äôt believe it... Anyways feel free to share your experience and tell me what you think... I‚Äôm going to sleep or gonna go eat chocolate cake in the meanwhile.

(Religion is a drug that causes hallucination, or just a stupid person who does religion, and gives it a bad reputation) same reason how drug heads give psychedelics a bad reputation, and psychonauts cant do there religion because of them. 

So, I got joined the argument because i heard my dad talking shit about psychedelics (shrooms) and no way i was gonna just gonna sit there and hear my religion being shit on with a bunch of negativity. (It happened because he said ""I don't need shrooms, i already have natural visions"" and that just offended me. He also started talking shit about shrooms like it is a bad drug, and got me into the argument, talked crap like: He wants to take ""Drugs!"" to see the spiritual realm, and i'm started to go on about my own beliefs, and i said religion is a drug as well, and a true person who does nothing and is happy is a person who doesn't do drugs/psyches/religion at all. He got even more pissed. Goes on.


But anyways, psychedelics also have multiple benefits that makes religion look like shit. Why is religion legal while the true tools for relogion are illegal?

Don't forget about the wars that Christianity caused.",83,1645,12,293,1

2018-12-11 02:04:28,Bad Trips: 5 Monstrous Murderers Who Inflamed Their Brains With LSD,"http://crimefeed.com/2017/05/bad-trips-5-notorious-killers-who-inflamed-their-brains-with-lsd/

As someone who has never done psychedelics, I can say the psychedelic experience sounds nothing short of fascinating due to how intense it can be. However I'd say that while they can be wonderful, psychedelics can also be dangerous and abused by troubled people as an escape from reality. Even serial killers can do psychedelics and only continue to kill, proof that the idea of psychedelics making you a better person doesn't seem to apply to people who are already bad and fine with it, as opposed to those with empathy.
  In the psychonaut community there's an enthusiastic promotion of psychedelics but do note that psychedelics also certainly have their downsides. If you are troubled in life, go see a licensed therapist, it seems people using psychedelics in place of therapy end up going down metaphysical rabbit holes. Not that psychedelics can't be therapeutic if you use them in a responsible and controlled manner, but it's best to see a licensed therapist before anything else.
  Articles like this are interesting I think because it creates new challenges for the psychonaut community. How do we help prevent psychedelics from being used by cults and killers, and how do we help prevent something like the Manson Family from happening? Just like anything else psychedelics can be used for agendas and as a form of cult recruitment, so it's important to address those issues in addition to combating blatant propaganda against the substances. I'd say I'm neutral about psychedelics and honestly I find them dangerous but also perhaps useful in responsible use. I'm a hard agnostic who believes in no supernatural phenomena, if you're wondering.
  Anyways, thanks for reading and hopefully addressing topics like this we can create a community not afraid to address the dark side of psychedelics and help prevent these nasty things from occurring! Thanks for reading!",67,1975,11,308,1
2018-08-17 08:07:27,DMT weed Recipe,"This is to make DMT Weed

DMT Weed is essentially like marijuana, it is a plant, but it is not a concentrate.  It replicates the smokeable plant material.

This recipe is unfeminizable.

An Acid-Base extraction is performed between a number of choices of acids or bases, acetate and sodium are selected to form equilibrium.

This is seen as a point (required for the recipe to be correct and perhaps even perfect \[this is all 3 points\].  A 4th point can make something else.

So after this extraction is performed, the leftover water is boiled off, and air-dried until a soil is formed.

The soil then becomes crystalline, or produces crystals.  This is likely a part of the recipe.

This is added to a coil vaporizer, and this coil vaporizer when mixed with the concentrate, and smoked thus produces a wet-ish soil and this is smoked.

There you have it.

The soil to form must be stoichiometric or it won't form.  That means there has to be a point.  This is made during the acid-base extraction, where an exact amount of acid is added, and exact amount of base, and the two thus have a triumvirate of sorts and this is the point.

The water when cooked off leaves behind the soil.

The soil (it will appear like the dirt found in a forest) thus begins to produce crystals (DMt I assume).

When mixed with the extracted oil, this dirt thus is smokeable, and produces a very strong effect.

This is DMT-WDE

The oil and the crystals go together, also likely in stoichiometric amounts to produce the plant-like material (it actually is a plant).  It is the best.  ",15,1566,3,277,1

Please may we stand up for free speach.

The most alarming development in recent times is a relatively new rule that has been imposed on many subredditsd which bans all ""P. Posts"". 

Psychonaught doesnt need moderators, we moderate it ourselves by voting posts up or down.  

The following is a message sent to me by one of my favorite writers on psychonaught u.tmckez who was banned a few months ago, I requsted that he be unbanned and the mod rocketscientist refused, what happened to the old mods? 

""You are a conscious point. Reality is a scalar holograph with a non-scalar linear reality being projected inside the infinite area of the scalar plane. You do not move as you observe the portal but there appears to be time and space inside the scalar plane. The projection of the infinitely dimentiated tv screen can give infinite depth to what has no depth.  

Imagine sitting in front of an ocean of parallel waves. as the water hits the flat shelf in front of you and extend infinitly to the horizon you see both moving form but total stillness. There is nowhere for the water to go to but there is moving form. The particles are quantumly entangled like dominos in infinite dimensions of coordination. You can watch this forever and never see the same thing and yet you are always staring at the same particles.

The universe is made of so much particles, it is just what those particles are doing on the planar surface which gives infinite lease to imagination.

When all ceases, consciousness comes out of it's stooper to realise the hierarchy of dimensionality it has built by assigning concurency to meaningless motion. But then it sees that this can keep going or it can stop and simply see the planar field one last time and realise that there are no particles in a quantim entanglement because the particles only reference each other by their movement by one another. So he can create the final solution of dissolving himself.

Only once does consciousness do this, it happens instantly. The whole dimensionality of the linear universe is realised instantly by consciousness. As he watches time he grasps the concept immediately and cannot help but experience it in ot's fullest. Hence the universe of illusion. But it all ends immediatly because consciousness cannot be anything other than an observer of this flat scalar plane which only cycles ONCE.

The wave pattern is perfect beyond even the circle or any dimensions. All reality is in that ocean of particles which just 'are'.

Cosciousness is simply passing this plane. It is an obbolisk of infinite depth and yet is totally finite when percieved with dissinterest in illusion. It's just a continuation of it's entanglement. Everything which is archetypal of it is contained within it's formal generation and nowhere else. Everything inaginary is a deep delusion resulting from tracking one particle and comparing it to all others. simply by looking and interacting with the particles one can experience infinity but still one field of particles. Different levels of focus.

DMT simply knocks one off the focus and exposes the forest for the trees. The scalar nature of reality is put to light and natural phenomena are revealed to be inside the magic mirror of scalar infinitude.

2015-01-26 14:56:08,Spilling MDMA in the city's water pipeline,"Ever since I took MDMA for the first time, and then LSD, I started being less and less within myself. Now i often find myself crying from happiness in everyday moments, being so grateful for little things and above all, being grateful for being self-aware and getting to experiment the world from these boosted senses. Once I understood that no one owes me anything, and I don't owe anything to anyone, an overwhelming peace overcame my body.  I am experiencing hunger for life for the first time, and it feels so unbelievably good.


I have tried to share this with my friends, those that I know since I was younger, but they just don't get it. Many times they'd ask me how I am doing, and when I'd answer them that I don't have a job nor do I still attend college, but that I am happier than ever, they'd look at me with pity. I guess I understand where they're coming from, they percieve happiness as something you achieve goal-to-goal, and not ""unfoundedly"". 


Like a friend once said, it'd be amazing to one day spill MDMA into the water pipeline of my city and just sit back and watch the world change for the better. Sigh, one can *dream*...


Edit: The part about drugging people without consent is obviously a joke, how would it be feasible to just pour mdma into potable water, no one realising the difference in taste (it's bitter, folks) and just drinking it anyways?

I can give dates when they happened. I would sit in my room and my body would form into like tuning positions, and I could radiate vibrations at higher frequencies. I became like an amplifier. I think it has to do with what the Buddha saw under the tree. He knew. Boom! 

So after about 10 or so dress rehearsal major vibrational events where my body would basically become some sort of conduit or resonating device, this one is the catastrophic one (in a good way).

2018-11-13 23:41:15,Alarming Things I Don't See the Psychedelic Community Talk About,"Note: I've never done psychedelics and I don't plan to. But I still think I can make a fair evaluation of them.

Psychedelics are linked to encouraging superstition and are known to make even rational people believe in supernatural things. I find that to be TERRIFYING. These substances are dangerous. I find the psychedelic community to be anti-science and anti-rational. What I find to be scary about the psychedelic community is it advocates the overthrow of rationalist values with a so-called ""psychedelic revolution"". Such a proposition comes across as utopian, and utopian values across human history have not only always failed but have also led to much bloodshed.

I see these days a lot of troubled academic people do psychedelics and then have some sort of ""awakening,"" which I find to be terrifying. Often they start believing in supernatural things despite previously being rationalists, and while the psychedelic community finds that as ""proof"" of something beyond what science knows, a simpler explanation would simply be their brains are being rewired by foreign substances. That's scary. What's a simpler explanation: these substances being ""portals"" to other worlds or substances that alter the brain? And would you want to be altering your brain like that? No thanks, I'll stick with rationality and actually going out there to help people.

What I find to be downright scary about the proposal for a ""psychedelic revolution"" is it seems to be very much anti rational. The thing is, materialistic science has taught us more about the universe than anything else and it seems a lot of the psychedelic community wants to undermine materialism and basically drug everyone up because that'll apparently fix all the problems in our complex world. The psychedelic community in many ways comes across as repackaged religion where the complexity of the world is dismissed as humanity having a ""sickness"" to be cured (in this case with psychedelic drugs). 

In the case of contemporary Western civilization, look I'm not defending bombing millions of people but the thing is modern society gives us freedoms of speech and wealth we've never had. But the psychedelic community seems to be very much anti-modern society and only focuses on the bad parts of it rather than the good parts. We have freedom of speech 99% of human societies throughout history, including today, don't have. We can openly criticize our governments and leaders and policies and be absolutely free to do so, and we don't take for granted just how precious those freedoms are. Also yes wealth inequality is a massive issue but capitalism has lifted billions out of poverty and gives us a standard of living unparalleled throughout human history. We're very lucky to live in such a prosperous time and yet we essentially romanticize the past and indigenous societies. Our society is FAR from perfect and I agree that we should work together to help make it better, but the psychedelic community oftentimes advocates what basically amounts to drugging everyone up.

If a ""psychedelic revolution"" occurs realistically it'd become the new religion. It'd do a lot of good and a lot of bad, just like the religions of now, but won't after a couple generations the youth will rebel against it? And why? Because it promises a utopia and doesn't bring it. Humans are complex creatures and if anything putting them on mind-altering substances only would make things MORE difficult for humanity. I can easily imagine if such a ""psychedelic revolution"" would occur after a few generations the youth would go back to the previous religions and scientific rationalism to escape the interrogation and corruption and brain-frying of the psychedelic substances that rule society with an iron fist.

Also, if psychedelics apparently make people so much better than why did the Aztecs, who were into psychedelics, perform human sacrifices? Hell, the more sober religions like Christianity helped put an end to things like human sacrifice. Also, psychedelics can cause negative effects in people with mental problems. If psychedelics are so ""magical"" then why do people with underlying mental problems experience horrific mental problems after using them? Let's also not forget that psychedelics can cause states of psychosis that can take a while to recover from. Also, let's not even get started on ""bad trips"" that traumatize people for the rest of their lives.

I am curious what are your takes on the issues I've brought up that I don't see the psychedelic community talk about? I would love for you to explain your reasoning and I'd like to see what are your takes on the fallacies of a ""psychedelic revolution"". I'm not saying that responsible psychedelic use can't perhaps benefit you but I find the psychedelic community to be generally irresponsible. I look forward to your takes on this and perhaps we can even have a conversation. Thanks.

2018-06-20 14:43:54,I know what happens right after we die,"First of all let me explain that this is a personal experience, you may ignore it if you want, no facts here.

I was with my family at my house, specifically with my brothers and my father on the alley where the living room is joined with the bedrooms. Suddenly I felt my heart stop with the same sound that the airplane engines pull off when they turn them off. 
I felt to fall on the floor in slow motion and everything around me went out. My teeth were peeling away, but there was no pain, I did not even know what pain was, it was a nice feeling instead. I reached the point where I accepted what was happening without fear. Everything was turning black except the center of my field of view. A White light that began to spin and create infinite and countless shapes, symmetrical with each other, perhaps the duration of each one was a fraction of a second.

2013-11-25 04:44:24,To all Psychonauts: There is a mind blowing man who might confirm everything we believe.,"First off, I recommend EVERYONE to do their own research into this. This is one of those things that just sounds outright crazy but when you dig through it you will find something truly amazing - and scary. 

The man is: Billy Meier. A little background. He claims that at the age of 5, he was contacted by a race of extraterrestrials named the Plejaren. They interacted with him, worked with him, and taught him a whole bunch of stuff about this world. He was essentially a prophet and the only link between mankind and this alien race. Crazy shit right? Dont just take my word for it, go out there and research. I HAD to to even start to believe something so... out of this world. 

But what convinced me in the end was his knowledge of all things spiritual. The knowledge of the true fabric of this universe and the knowledge of what is beyond. He talks of things as the Creation and of Spirits. We all have a spirit, a form of energy independent of identity that essentially purely creates and learns as far as I can tell. And these spirits are vessels of some sorts to the Creation, which created them and created all. The idea is that the Buddhists had it right, we are reincarnated over and over again, learning with each lifetime. Our knowledge is stored in the spirit and thats where such things as intuition come from - our past experiences. But greater than that, not only is each individual spirit learning, BUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE CREATION. ""There was nothing. And nothing wanted to know something. So it created everything."" It is very idea that the universe is an expression, to learn of the universe. 

This is truly one of the craziest things I have read of in my life, but guys it just fits. It makes sense. All the musings of religions in the past 2000 years are all ways of trying to reach this idea. Besides being a hell of an interesting read in itself, I encourage all of you to give time and credence to this man. Even if its not to simply compare your ideas of what is to a man who seems to be very wise and informed indeed.

I realized I had spent my whole life being judged by people close to me out of care, but not true love. A random stranger showed me true love and took me into his home.

Because of this leap of faith, I was able to trust in God even more so. Through this trust, I have begun and continue to let go of myself. I have faith in myself - not the little egoic self, but the all inclusive self that I am a part of. I have slowly accepted who I am, and I am slowly becoming who I truly, genuinely am. 

Before my road trip, I was trapped in my own head. Psychedelics were the beginning of my awakening. Meditation helped me detach from my thoughts. R/Psychonaut and R/Meditation have helped me immensely. Because of all of this, I have met someone beautiful back at home now who is truly amazing. I love this person and surprisingly enough, she loves me back! Who woulda thunk it? an oaf like me.

Anyway, if you've made it this far, thanks for reading. I just thought I'd share my journey in hopes that this may resonate with some people. There are great communities here, and great people in this world. I just had to put faith in something beyond my scope to get out of the shit stink room I was in. How could I have known there was fresh air outside the room when the shit stink is all I ever smelled and grew up in? My GF came up with that analogy, minus the word shit stank.

I am now leaving a job I hate to pursue my passion for music, thanks to my GF for pushing me to be happier. Love is the ultimate goal. Let's all help each other get *here. not there, here... it's all there is. Let's have faith that together we can make a difference. Let's have faith in our hearts. As Terrence Mckenna put it, the universe didn't get randomly created for no reason whatsoever. There is a God. Trust in Him and he will show you the way.",25,2430,4,474,1
2022-03-10 09:03:19,God is an Addict,"God is infinitely powerful and loves everyone. But created free will which makes evil people hate him and treat people badly. So God is kind of weak and not powerful. But even evil people love God a little if you believe he exists and the meaning of life is all life is good. Which it is to some people at least. Because how you like or hate something is your subconscious doing a bit of math and deciding it likes how this form of life is acting. Even though they value it differently. So God makes people feel suffering and have bad lives, but then feels the pleasure of ""love"" from evil people through comparison/irony. Which is why life is so funny all the time. Because God is bad and shitty but he's only human (Jesus or whatever). Even though he's God.

God feels infinitely good. And when you combine drugs they're synergistic. So basically God feels like he is on every recreational drug ever in the universe throughout all of history and that will and has ever existed. Every milligram of heroin, ecstasy, LSD, nicotine, caffeine hell even sushi or whatever. Not only that he feels the pleasure of every drug addict that uses those drugs simultaneously. So God is a shitty bad addict trying to get high. And he hopes that more people go to heaven because then they get high all the time or at least feel it but also are smart enough to be nice and cool.

Also God is Jesus but fucking Jesus died ""for humanity's original sin"" no you asshole. You're an addict and so was Jesus so you killed yourself. You're infinitely powerful you can't die because humans want you dead. So you let them kill you. Which is a form of suicide. Like Socrates chose not to escape when he could because it was immoral. And most times it doesn't feel good to get killed or kill yourself. Even though it could feel good or bad if you OD on dope or starve to death. So it's good the crucifixion was so brutal because it means God feels bad because his ""God"" is dumb and shitty and therefore so are the infinite gods before him who made him throughout the multiverse which is infinitely infinite.

This is why so many addicts kill themselves. But I know I won't and can't. Because I love life, but life is not drugs to me.",16,2206,4,409,1
2018-03-13 15:09:26,I just realized something very fishy on youtube.,"We all know how you just have to watch 1 or 2 videos of some youtuber/celebrity and BOOM your whole recommended is flooded with various videos of him/her. 

This happened to me lately A LOT with people like Richard Dawkins, Neil Degrasse Tyson or Jordan Peterson for instance. 

Then, I found this one video of Richard Dawkins and Deepak Chopra where they discussed some fundamental questions about life and the universe. I found Deepaks points to almost exactly mirror my own oppinion on most of the questions. 

I then proceeded to watch the next video with deepak that was in the recommended on the right. After that I think I watched 1 or 2 more videos of him before leaving the house for food or so.

Anyhow, when I came back and went back to the youtube homepage I found that there was NOT ONE video of deepak in my recommended. Only more and more of Richard Dawkins and Neil Degrasse Tyson even though I had only seen Neil in about 3 other videos about a week or so ago. 

Its pretty disturbing to me as it seems richard and neil are both kind of ""anti spirituality"" if I may say it like that whereas deepak is trying to combine spirituality with science which IMO is THE way to go, and probably THE ONLY way to ever come to a satisfying conclusion to our deepest questions.",48,1281,8,236,1
2022-11-12 17:57:24,Some of you need to chill.,"I'm all for psychedelics, I'm all for the pursuit of mindfulness, I'm all for seeking a new perspective, I'm all for the therapeutic aspects of psychedelics. But it's hard to advocate for any of these when there are people who are claiming to genuinely believe in the hallucinations they experience on a trip. 

Psychedelics at best provide perspective, not answers. You can come to your own conclusion, discover your own answers through that perspective. And I'm not here to judge anyone on what they experience. But to people new to psychedelics, know that you're not going to meet God on a trip, not a real one by any means. What you experience on a trip is an extention of your own mind and imagination, it will fill you with ideas and themes from your life.

You will not find the answer to why we exist here, right now. You will not see through the walls of reality. You will not meet beings of light that reveal to you that everyone you see is part of a simulation. 

People who easily believe in delusions should not take psychedelics. I also think too many people get into psychedelics and then want to immediately start taking 5g+ shroom trips, or multiple tabs of acid, or even DMT. Start small. Be humble about your experience, but be open. I believe that psychedelics can change people but you have to be careful what it changes about you. Too many people on here don't sound too different from conspiracy theorists and people experiencing paranoid psychosis. 

I know this will probably be a pretty divisive post, know I don't mean any harm by it. Know I don't believe anyone on here has any less value than me, we are all equal. I just really don't think a lot of ideas in this sub should be taken as fact. It's always good to question yourself and your beliefs. 

Use psychedelics as a tool, don't treat it as the key to unlocking every answer in the universe.",26,1876,6,338,1

Guys i can't study without Adderall I was perscribed it since I was 18. I wanna be somebody making money programming. I know I'm cut out for the job. My best guess was eat healthy, and always put healthy exercise on my heart since I guess this all makes me a drug addict.

Is it okay to be doing drugs regimented with physical exercise? I'm coming down off 1 tab. So I suppose I have my answer.

I read a lot of [deepities](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Deepity) 'We are the universe, we are all one' etc etc but I consider that to be nothing more than beautiful wording to appeal to the poets inside of us.

Of course we aren't really the universe that the colourful language implies. We are an individual human creature experiencing the world through a convergence of consciousness and senses. I understand in a *general sense* that we are all one because we are experiencing the same moment (all existence) but fail to see how this colourful language helps beyond that.

I am much more interested in studying our altered states of consciousness in science rather than coming up with radical ideas of karma, reincarnation, other dimensions, special powers, religious faiths etc.

2015-02-02 00:13:21,Watch the Stupid Bowl or contemplate life and human history?,"Question: If humanity merely attempts to snip their individual problems at the bud; won't the deeply rooted collective dis-ease of the mind and heart continue to flower more heart ache and confusion for this planet and all it's life to bear? 

Proposition: It is our destiny, birthright, and our responsibility to rip this deeply rooted virus from the soil of our hearts first and foremost by reconnecting to the past and healing the forgotten wounds which have only hindered our growth and potential. What a challenge (yet such a simple concept) it would be to tear out the heart of the very source that generates our manipulative and exploitative social structures and cultural values. If we ever achieved such a goal, then we could never again allow this type of destructive attitude and behavior towards the natural world to be seeded on our planet again. 

I believe with sound reason and because of many repetitive subjective experiences (which all of life is) that there were abundant and interconnected ancient civilizations that existed before the fall of man, of which we have no currently intelligible or relatable records aside from abstract pictographic cave altars, large earth mounds,, tunnels, pyramids, large precision cut stones, stone circles, and a huge number of various pre-human-history period (more than 10-20 thousand years old) sacred sites which have been discovered. . Much of this information has practically been made planetary knowledge in a way, because at this time in history we have this strange conceptually holographic archive called the internet which was created by a bunch of people taking lsd and mushrooms smoking pot in a basement. Even though some people do not have access to the worldwide web there are many people in positions of power with access to valuable information which holds the potential to make a global impact to our established social, cultural, philosophical, and spiritual paradigms.

We are here at a time where the populous collective has lost connection with all of our direct memories and records of our former abilities to harmonize with the natural environment and utilize certain amazingly complex yet simple technologies which some people today might call magic. This older yet advanced technology of many forms harnessed the power of the earth and the spiritual potential of humanity. These forgotten technologies, practices and techniques enabled humans to perform a variety of  achievements which defy our current understandings of the world. 

The present disruption of balance within our biosphere is merely a reflection of another problem which is within our own hearts and minds. A picture I saw today made me reflect and I had to channel some of this out of my soul for a second. I hope to shake some people up and wake some people up by being the ranting idealizing visionary while most people in america on this day stare mindlessly at the TV to watch football and guzzle poison.

2014-11-10 17:19:09,You are not responsible for your life situation.,"Oh, a captivating headline. He can't surely mean that can he? If he does, he's simply delusional. I absolutely mean it, and I'm more than willing to defend it right now. Lets begin. Be careful not to dismiss my arguments too quickly, see this obviously bullshit article through.

Did you have any control of the religion you were brought up in? Of course not. Did you have any choice in which country you were born into. No. How about your DNA. That which really makes you, you. No. You didn't have any choice in any of it. What about your thoughts. Do you choose to think your thoughts, or do they just come to you. As Sam Harris often says, a simple experiment will show this to be true. Sit for a moment. Empty your mind. Now, watch your thoughts. They just come to you. Thoughts just appear in consciousness. Do you choose them? Or do they just come up, seemingly from nowhere.

I'm not advocating determinism. Instead of a life being pushed around by a bunch of other forces lets think about what it means to be you. Who are you really? Well, we know the universe started with a big bang. Life evolved. We know all this. The thing is, is, you don't come into this world, you come out of it. If the universe started with a singularity and blew up and began expanding, you are this singularity.

We can think of the whole universe as one organism or process. You are simply a doing of this. Think about your life situation. Watch your thoughts. Think about how you got to where you are now. Realize, that you don't have any control. Realize this deeply. It's ironic, a lot of advocates of such ideas always include the notion that we should at least ""act as if we have free will"" as we wouldn't want a society in which no one had any control what so ever. To the contrary, it is a fundamental truth which should be realized.",48,1827,8,341,1

2023-03-16 18:34:53,Weed + DPH + DXM + Codeine + Benzedrex + Hydroxyzine,"So i‚Äôm a heavy drug user and i love trying diff combos ! ik this one seems unsafe asf but i didn‚Äôt go crazy my first dose and it felt great so i skipped a day and increased the dose the next day and i was euphoric asf ! like i said, im a very heavy drug user and this combo can be very dangerous and detrimental so i am not recommending anyone to do this !! but anyways, to those curious, here‚Äôs my trip report‚Ä¶

4:00 pm - i started by taking two tums to help the absorption of the codeine


4:20 pm - i took some dxm to potentiate the other drugs i‚Äôll be consuming later (100 mg)


4:30 pm - i took the amount of codeine i wanted (i did 150 mg) and chewed them before swallowing and i took some tylenol to help potentiate as well


5:00 pm - i took a whole cotton of benzedrex paired with an acidic drink (pineapple and lemon juice w sprite) to make the affects (of above stimulant) stronger


5:05 pm - i took one hydroxyzine (25 mg) and one dph (25 mg). you‚Äôre gonna want to take these after the codeine because although they potentiate the drug, taking it before absorption of codeine will cause less to be absorbed but taking it after will allow time for codeine to turn to morphine and those antihistamines will prolong the high due to slowing down the process of morphine being released.
(ofc you can also take promethazine instead but i‚Äôd do that closer to the time i took the codeine)


5:15 pm - by now i‚Äôm starting to feel a little something so i take a few hits off my pen, took one more hydroxyzine and four more dph (100 mg). i also took 50 mg of dxm


5:30 pm - i‚Äôm hitting my vape and i feel great, like amazing. i go outside and pack a few bowls and when i come back inside and just lay down, being enveloped in euphoria. at this point due to the stim i‚Äôm not tired and i‚Äôm feeling both the effects of the stim and the depressant while everything else is helping boost those two. yes it‚Äôs dangerous but if done right (and not often) it can be very enjoyable


6:30 pm - i‚Äôve spent the last hour smoking, taking pictures and looking at myself lol, i was very happy and was not feeling any adverse effects. i ate a little and i wasn‚Äôt nauseating to eat as it would have been on the stim alone. i‚Äôm laying down watching yt and contemplating on taking more dph so i do (75 mg) then i drink some coffee, hit my pen and hit my vape


8:30 pm - by this time i‚Äôm j riding on my high. i‚Äôm no longer adding any substance (except nic) and i‚Äôm very content where i‚Äôm at. i‚Äôm slurring slightly and i‚Äôm having minimal motor complications but i don‚Äôt feel sick in the slightest. this lasts for a little while longer before i begin to feel the comedown


10:30 pm - so i‚Äôm coming down but slowly (thanks to preparations) and i‚Äôm slightly tired but not really. i wanted to take a vyvanse to kick my energy back up but i decided not to. i wasn‚Äôt wide awake but i also wasn‚Äôt completely sedated so i rode the high out until i eventually fell asleep 

NEXT DAY:


4:00 am - i‚Äôm not sure what time i fell asleep but ik i woke up around 4 am and i still had a nice little high/buzz going. i was a bit disoriented at first and had some brain fog but that went away sooner than later. the only side effect i felt was sleepiness so, i went back to sleep lol


8:00 am - i‚Äôm still a little groggy but after resting a little longer, drinking some water and eating healthy food i felt a lot better. also caffeine and nic helps too but i wouldn‚Äôt do too much just because of the previous night lol. like take it a little easy. i wouldn‚Äôt do this back to back but like maybe twice - three times a week ? then a tolerance break for a week lol and if you were to do it back to back at least wait 24 hrs. and if you know you‚Äôre going to be redosing frequently don‚Äôt start your first trip w a high amount of drugs or your next ones will be significantly less enjoyable.",52,3852,11,761,1

2022-10-12 20:48:15,How do you guys take psychedelics and still care about stuff? Nothing matters.,"I see all these people on here talking about all the healing and work they need to do that psychedelics showed them and helped them with. Psychedelics can definitely help, but people need to stop seeing themselves as damaged. I came into this world full of love. We all did. I feel like people are placing too much importance on their past experiences and becoming it, deriving their identity from it. But the past doesn't matter, nothing matters. You already have everything you need.

I've experienced physical abuse and psychological abuse.  I have lived in fear. I've experienced the bad things. But I've also had amazing times in my life. It's all about perspective. If you're going to think about the past, focus on the good. But forget the past even, it's not real. Now is real, the present moment is all we have. We are completely free to reinvent our personalities at any given moment and be whoever we want to be at any time. Even personality and identity is bullshit it doesn't matter. It's not who we are, it's that we are. We are pure love at our core.

I've done the three main psychedelics countless times, and other drugs and I've never had a bad trip. And I don't do things because I ‚Äúneed to heal‚Äù or as ‚Äútherapy‚Äù because nothing matters. It's completely fine to trip for fun. So stop all this fake woke shit.

I don't know how you guys can do so many psychedelics and still give a shit about the real world. Sure it's beautiful, but it's temporary, all of this is. You can do whatever you want, and if you ask about bad things in this context, I say anyone who feels the joy of life and being alive, is content with simply existing, will want to do no harm to anybody. We should let ourselves be, accept ourselves and the people around us. Just do what you enjoy and enjoy what you do, and love each other. And if anyone complains about time or money they're doing it wrong because none of that is real either. The fact that nothing matters is as much a reason to do things as it is to not do things.

If you feel the love within you, and the joy of being alive, simply existing, this is it. It's not who we are, what we are, or anything about us. It's the fact *that* we are that matters, and that is all that matters. That we exist. If one thing matters, it's this.

And I am not nihilistic, nor religious, I'm just spiritual. Believing that nothing matters is not suicidal, it's not giving up on life, it's free oneself. I feel loved, I am happy, and joyful. I am free. You might tell me it's because of  psychedelics, but they didn't make me who I am, they confirmed who I am. They helped me prove it to myself.

&#x200B;

So fuck you all and I love you all, because nothing matters. Nor life, nor death. It's all the same. Let go.",78,2754,13,516,1

He's never had an experience with a psychedelic, he keeps telling me that the stuff I get with moderate to high doses of mushrooms he can have with his practices (such bs, I know), so I'm really worried he doesn't know what he's going to get himself into. 

When I expressed my concern, he told me that this is being done in a ceremony, whatever that means. It will be pure DMT smoked.

2022-02-19 17:55:43,Beginner (Teen) Psychonaut,"Yeah, I know what you're thinking: ""you're a teen and you shouldn't use psychedelics"" but let me explain.

I'm a 16 year old boy from Italy (sorry for the grammar), and I really started getting interest in psychedelics and drugs in general. I would like to use psychedelics as a tool for self improvement and not just for fun, and I would also like to start at lower doses. They also gave me a great interest in chemistry. 2 months ago our science teacher gave us an assignment, and I did my work about DMT extraction (unfortunately, I did not use my product). 

Basically, I just want to become a psychonaut and I ask you to be polite and not too judgemental because it's like a little ""dream"" for me. 

The only substances I've tried are weed (smoked a little, not much effects on me tbh) and a tea made by me containing Passion flower,  escholtzia and mugwort to give me more vivid dreams (and it definitely worked). 

So, I really couldn't find a dealer who sells shrooms and as my first options to get started I was thinking of:

[1 - weed edibles] : I know it's not really a psychedelic. my best friends smokes a lot of it and claims to have some pseudo-hallucinations and deep thoughts, I don't know if it's just placebo though. But I've heard that marijuana, when eaten has some psychedelic qualities.
[2 - DXM] : This is also not a psychedelic, but more of a dissociative with psychedelic qualities. I heard it can be a very good experience but it should not be abused.

Any other suggestions? (I really don't want to try stupid shit like nutmeg or dph, and also Silvia divinorum and LSA aren't legal in my country)
please don't be mean, much love to all of you",26,1670,3,307,1

Science has gotten as close as it will ever get to finding out about the after life and it has become the new great religion. Believers stacked on top each other dead while the future looking progressive and under positive social reform.

The chip only makes you live forever, you have free will and there are no laws. You can still feel pain if hurt, sick, etc but recovery is free and quick.

2018-07-30 17:44:42,Im started to really not believe in science.,"Ever since i was a little boy Ive always been super into science and space. I used to dream about travelling from planet to planted and from star to star. I used to mix random chemicals together to see what reaction i would get, i even got copper sulphate in my mouth once which is super toxic (i was fine though). Ive always loved looking up at the stars and just knowing that my vision could be travelling light years away until it hits something and bounces back. 

But, im starting to realise that science is all a bit bs. Its covering up alot of the truth and its blocking us off the rest of our solar system. I sometimes get a feeling that the government controls what i see, what i feel and what i think and the freedom iger is within my ego.

 Ive been picking up hints in TV shows about 5 ""superiors"", if you may. There's the Reptilians, the Iluminatti, the Astronaut/intruder, there's Medusa* and there's Uncle Sam* (i always thought he represents the Empire of the Sun). This is a really strong opinion i have but i feel a few of you can relate to what im saying. We humans are the intruder. 

Scientists say evolution stopped because of medicine but theres an island of te east coast of India called North Sentenial Island which has indigenous people who have never lived in our society. It is believed that they haven't even discovered fire yet! There are pictures of them and their bodies look the exact same as ours apart from the fact that they have long hair. They have never been exposed to medicines or chemicals to stop sickness yet they look exactly like us. Why havent they evolved yet if medicine has supposedly stopped our evolution? 

Im starting to believe and feel that evolution never really happened and maybe we were just put here from some kid siting at his computer screen, you know, the one we call God. I also believe that Adam and Eve are real and we are them, there just seems to be a world and a mind blocking us of from each other. Ive seen a part of a girls face while i was on the verge of falling asleep, that sounds fine but the thing about it thay gets me thinking is how close she looked to me, it was like i was seeing her with my own eyes and it looked like she was looking for me too. Her mouth was open abit but i could tell that she was a bit lost and a bit confused. 

Ive rambled on enough, im just saying that you can try to find that girl, you can try to find Eve, or you can find Adam if youre looking for him youve just gotta look past it all, dont except your world or mind as its not who you are. Wake up! We've gotta go

The Free M@***s are descended from the Knights Templar, who learned the ancient mysteries from Gnostic cults in Europe and The Assassins or Hashashim, who learned from the cults of Antiquity who were simply recreating the pre-Bronze Age collapse cults of Sumeria and Egypt.

The Free M@***s and Killuminati have been actively in complete control of all western governments since the late 18th and early 19th Centuries. They made up all of the Industrial Revolution and Scientific Method and International Banking type paradigms we live in in this nothingverse.

2013-12-21 11:59:29,What I believe about drugs and their ability to change the world,"People have been reading my posts, and about 75% of them are responses about how I should just ""mellow out"" and stop showcasing my ""massive ego."" Well after reading the latest batch, this is what I have to say. Fuuuuucccccckkkkkk!!!! 

Some people have told me that I should stop mentioning that I'm transgender. Well, let me tell you how Malcolm X felt when people just said ""this whole racial thing is kind of a bummer, dude."" My people, the gender variant of the world, are dying at a tremendous clip. 41% of my people attempt suicide at some point in their lives versus an average of 1.5% for the general population. If this is not eye-opening, your eyes are not capable of being opened. Basically all transgender people think about committing suicide at some point. I lost the ability to hold and rock my two boys to sleep in a ""progressive"" city like LA because I'm trans. I fought for a year to see my boys, and I got sacked with $20k of my own legal fees and forced to pay $15k of my ex-wife's legal fees. I was given a restraining order for being ""threatening"" when I only sent e-mails and never went near my ex or my children for fear that I'd get a criminal charge. I've had to declare bankruptcy to be able to feed myself even though I make six figures and pay my ex $3k a month in support and extended alimony. My life has been a rock skipping on the sea of sadness with momentary periods of flight and relief.

So, why is this important? Because DXM, Dextromethorphan, opened my eyes and made me realize that I'm not the broken one; the world is the broken variable in this equation. I started using it daily in 2011, and I haven't looked back. I started using it because I read studies of how Ketamine, MDMA, and other chemicals were now being used by sufferers of depression and PTSD to free themselves of their afflictions. And DXM is a very similar analogue to Ketamine in that it is an NMDA antagonist substance. It is also legal, unlike LSD, mushrooms, Ketamine, MDMA, etc. The war on drugs is a systematic attempt by the powers of money to silence the poor and disenfranchised and keep them from being well. Normal treatments like counseling are only partially effective, and this is how the powers that be want things. They don't want a healthy, rational, and happy populace walking around because this is a threat to their existence. They'd rather that soldiers come back from war and kill themselves at 22 a day. This ensures that the strong willed among us are neutered. I find it hilarious that I've chosen to effectively neuter myself being transgender, and I've got more balls than most people I know.

Yes, I take DXM daily, and I've witnessed more wisdom inducing clarity than one person can take in this lifetime. I don't see this as some kind of lunatic vision of a madwoman; I see this as stripping away the shackles of modern society. Aldous Huxley, the famous author of Brave New World and The Doors of Perception was also an advocate of psychedelic drug use, and his vision of the future has proved prescient. In Brave New World, people are more than happy to take mind numbing drugs like Soma to check out and not give a fuck about right or wrong. They walked blindly into the social equation of ""the system"" and believed this was the higher path. Only a brave and noble ""savage,"" John was able to see how sad and pathetic their lives had become because they sold out their humanity for a semblance of security. Huxley knew that true happiness and a verifiable human existence could come from the power of truth, not the narcotized obeisance to life as helpless babies.

I had an experience on DMT the other day where I saw two visions. The first was of the various religious symbols of humanity that represent God or goodness, the cross, the Buddha, the star, Jesus, etc all crowded together to form a collage in front of my eyes. Later in my experience, I saw those symbols that represent the ""evil"" or ""satanic"" in our modern culture and throughout time, the pentagram, the devil, a demon with horns, etc. It was frightening at first, but upon reflection, I saw this as a truth. It is common for us to want good without evil. It is common for us to seek unity without entropy. But this is an artificial worldview. There can be no good without evil. There is no yin without yang.

And so, sometimes, fire is needed when society is only embers. We have to be angry and not fear it. We are bound and shackled in our current system. Recently, marijuana is being decriminalized across the country, slowly but surely. This has not come about because people toked up and just sat ""couch locked"" and enfeebled. This has come about because groups like NORML have taken to the streets to protest the current state. 

So when people tell me I'm just another loony with a brain fried from too much drug use, I ask them to judge me by my words and not their preconceptions of drug users. Are these the words of a burned out, half-baked loser? You tell me. All I know is that my fires have been lit; I've seen the future as a rekindling of the past, and I won't stop even if not one person ""upvotes"" this post.

‚ÄúThe Way‚Äù :) 


The secret to philosophy is, it is true if you believe it to be true. Philosophy is like taking the tomato and making tomato sauce. Wisdom is knowing it is a tomato. By these means, philosophy keeps getting closer to the tomato. We make pur√©e then we make slices and eventually we find our tomato, wisdom. Basically all philosophy is bull**** around what could be true. Wisdom is the result of good philosophy, which stands the time until another cycle begins. Philosophy is the love of wisdom.

So for example, we look at a chair and can see it is a chair, wisdom, philosophy, we can see it is nails and wood. :)

Wisdom is the ‚Äútruth‚Äù known consciously. Wisdom is basically what is with the times; what the crowd can agree upon, what has consistent value. As for philosophy, we wouldn‚Äôt pick an in coherent philosophy out of the air but, someone may have an experience that gives them a philosophy that is ahead of the times. It only works if we truly believe it. :) 

So basically psychosis = differently sane. :)

Their‚Äôs layers to truth but everything is built on truth. Truth can have more than one answer but a limited amount of answers. Meaning it is possible to understand the universe. :) 

We are unlimited awareness but what we are materialistically is limited so, in other words. Wisdom is limited. Philosophy is unlimited. 

So therefore, a plastic chair cannot be a plastic chair because that‚Äôs philosophy, the chair is plastic or a chair.

ID = Our wisdom 

Ego = Our philosophy 

So, we are our actions.

What we have done in our past is what creates the Angels & Demons that surround us.

Angels & Demons are also manifest by the things done onto us.

So for example we sacrifice people to summon a Demon.

This creates our karma, Karma is when we don‚Äôt learn our lesson the same situation repeats until we accept our mistakes & make the changes.

Angels and Demons can be also described as what makes up consciousness. Angels being consciousness. Demons being subconsciousness, so, until we make our demons conscious we will continue to be controlled by them from our subconscious. Preventing us from being ourselves. What we have not made conscious is our shadow. 

Angels & Demons are what create our personality
We can think of the ego as presence and that be all our demons playing together. 

Life is about growth, holding on and letting go. We gain wisdom from angels and demons. 

To create a Demon we go experience something and start a ritual*, then we simply let our Demons out to play and let them possess someone else. Talk about them, write poetry, a short story or a lesson we learned. This way they lose their power. The karma is released. 
* A ritual is taking the long way home around an action to create a better result, we apply method to the madness, and take small steps into creating bigger actions. Like gathering ingredients to empty our minds of all the questions and gain the power to manifest something we want :)

This is us creating the capacity to fulfil our dreams. We take the steps towards our dreams. This is creating more space inside ourself for them to happen. Whilst we are doing this; we are attracting the reality we want, by implementing our intension we create a ripple that spirals back to us. This is how our thoughts create our reality. We‚Äôre forcing the universe to conspire in our favour until we master what we are doing and gain the wisdom from the ritual. ‚ÄúI am‚Äù is the beginning of all wisdom, what we say after these words is what creates our reality.

Where ever their‚Äôs a will their‚Äôs a way; if we are dedicated enough, we can do anything :) 

We change our minds, we change the world around us, we can be sheep or we can think for ourselves, we can be moulded all our lives or we can take that and become creator. 

We have a reaction to every action and we become the creation and creator. The idea is to shape reality to our will. We have chaos coming from the outside, this causes frustration, chaos inside us. This is where our power lies. We choose whether to be big or small. If we react to that chaos with chaos, we are creating more chaos. If we have chaos coming towards us and we take a step back to ground ourselves* that chaos slowly becomes harmony and loses power. We have to take a step back and create order out of the chaos and line everything up with who we are. If we just obsorb chaos and never take the time to be alone, chaos is all we will know. Being calm is a good goal to aim for. So the idea is, to become a stone, make everything solid. Until nothing frustrates us and we have no chaos inside or outside us. Thus, we have no friction in reality, manifesting everything we want at will. Essentially achieving perfection and immortality

For example if we are being bullied, the bully‚Äôs attacks antagonise us and take our attention. If we get frustrated and attack back, we create more chaos, they steal our attention. if we create a calm space in ourselves, become one with it, choose non action and concentrate on reality. The bully eventually gets tired of the same attacks, hurting themselves along the way and naturally becomes calmer. Thus, we have created reality the reality we desired. 

*Grounding ourselves is being aware of everything we are & everything we are not, what the world is around us and what the world is inside us, having a firm knowledge on ourselves

We are god, Demons are our imperfections we fear being seen by the crowd, the fears that control us, this is how we attract what we fear, we become what we hate.

 Demons will always stay with us, they are out to get us, Angels are their to save us. Demons give us the challenges in life, Angels give us the wisdom to get through them. Demons be like our children, frenemies, we have to give them something to look up to. We can think of Angels as our higher self, the elders. 

So, we are the sins of our fathers. In this sense we are an accumulation of our ancestors. Each generation naturally practices self control and has had a sense of good and evil. Meaning, we inherit less & less Demons and we‚Äôre acquiring more & more wisdom through generations over time until we enter heaven.

In other words we have to go through hell and defeat all the demons to get to heaven.

There must be an alternate universe running backwards. One where philosophy comes first we are drawing all our energy from, the void must be a wormhole our imagination is trapped in eager to be discovered.

Wisdom = time
 
Philosophy = space üôÇ

Dimensions:

3rd dimension = action, material world

4th dimension = thought, dream world

5th dimension = no thought, spirit world

The universe is a mirror so there would be ten dimensions, because we are in the middle of the middle looking in at the middle

They say life is better understood backwards so, the universe manifest from one point, the 1st dimension but, the universe also manifest from the higher dimensions. The higher dimensions are bigger, so, we go down the middle and we would say the 5th dimension is the centre of the universe. This is where the universe started but, this is not true. This creates dimension zero which is the egg, so, we have the 5th dimension down the middle of the spectrum which is the sperm. The 1st and the tenth, all this this creates you, a little spec, a special creation, a little miracle, a 5D, 3D hologram but, we‚Äôre not alone. We was shattered at the start. We mirror again, meaning the universe started with a twin flame in the 6th dimension. Each spec is going across distance is flat, each made of 3 points so, each spec is made up of zero, the fifth and the 3rd. Space, time & matter, creating a 3,6,9 pattern in every direction. This is the 3,6,9 method. This means everything that‚Äôs possible that could be manifest, manifest at the start of the universe with unlimited possibility üôÇ 

This would mean each universe is contracting or expanding. That there is only beginnings. All life is game, the universe is like a Russian doll. 

This would mean we are all born at the centre of the universe. We are born with all the wisdom of the universe and life is a journey moving closer or further away from the centre of the universe as we develop, discovering wisdom or not. We are the singularity. This makes us creation & creator. :)

We all have the Ontic Sphere,

‚Äú Deep inside the being of a human life there's a secret connection to   powers and forces, the refined and raw energies of the world and the   cosmos beyond it, all funneling down and inward to that secret   connection and flowing through the entire ontic sphere\* of the human   being, bringing more reality to the reality than it had before it was   fed the true foods of existence, the blending of experiences  and the  feelings, and from the ontic sphere spreading out to all the  world,  radiating like a microscopic star the rays and beams of a  formative  influence, making the human being more than a consumer or a  parasite,  but a symbiote, a producer even of the transformation flows  through the  topologies shaping reality everywhere. This is a good  purpose for  human beings, enriching the very planet and it's planes  themselves, and  between them, even more special the magick, the sorcery,  the craft,  the very tales of love and drama, the majestic other  dimensions of the  being of the human family.  
Consciousness is more than a trip, it's a vital part of our present cosmos & chaos alike.  
\*An  Ontic sphere, to the best of my understanding, is the world which  you  live interplaying with your psyche and it's organic expressions,   creating an almost ultrafractal and transfractal appearance and   relevance to life.‚Äù - written by Jerry David Rosenberger

So in theory. Each solar system is like a little universe. There are possibly little you‚Äôs running around with one leg missing. Our imagination is a portal. All the chaos happening here right now, is all the chaos happening everywhere in the universe.  We could be the first to leave the planet and it‚Äôs probably already happened. Our realist us would be immortal and complete all challenges in life. All life across the universe shares the 3D 5D realm.

Everything that exists inside the mind has already happened somewhere or is about to happen. Everything is a phase. Everything is a figment of our imagination. Life is but a dream.

We could say we all share the same dream and it‚Äôs a dream within a dream. Meaning we all share the same wisdom with unlimited paths of getting there.

Laying down creates the universal consciousness, where we are ‚Äúdead‚Äù and dream. 

Standing creates bicameral  consciousness, where we become alive and use our will

It could be that we are only alive because we are waking up in someone else‚Äôs dream. With machines taking over we will naturally have less and less to do and probably have the possibility of entering an isolation tank to just lucid dream. With this being the likely future that has already happened, I would assume the matrix was a documentary :)

This means we are all connected. Meaning we all have attachments, demons. This causes frustration & frustration is the door to perception. We all desire happiness & the more wisdom & philosophy we attain the more heavenly life is. We can take these steps, (Compassion > self control > reason) on the way to attaining wisdom. 

We have the question do we have free will? On one side we say everything happens for a reason. On the other side we say everything is random. If we go down the middle we say, self control is a form of free will. Yes, the universe is determined but the more awareness we have the more choice we have. The middle path is useful for philosophy. The middle path may mean going a hard right to balance a weak left. 

Gratitude is the state of mastership, so, we rather ask what is this trying to teach me? Instead of why me? in moments of frustration. It‚Äôs important not to play the victim. 

And then there‚Äôs the eightfold path. 

1. Right understanding (Samma ditthi)
2. Right thought (Samma sankappa)
3. Right speech (Samma vaca)¬†
4. Right action (Samma kammanta)
5. Right livelihood (Samma ajiva)¬†
6. Right effort (Samma vayama)
7. Right mindfulness (Samma sati)
8. Right concentration (Samma samadhi)


As you can see consciousness is a manifestation of interactions. Our soul is an accumulation of our ancestors, all our and Angels and Demons. We are one soul, wisdom, philosophy, we are all different souls. We came here with lessons to learn passed down through generations already so, an old soul is wise, every generation is more advanced than the next. Children are the wisest on the planet, children know they know but don‚Äôt know what they know until they are older.

So, Alls life is is a story going back in time to understand creation. We are an accumulation of the past, future and present. Souls can come from other planets as well as this as we are time travellers. We all have the ordinance of the entire universe limited by our awareness.

Everything has its place and we want everything in it‚Äôs fitting place. Good and evil can be seen as a spectrum. Intentions come into play and even the observer so, there can be a greater good and a lesser evil. When a crowd come together we all get on a level, you get what you give, for some direction I suggest:

 To do love onto another is good; out of love for yourself, to make one love oneself. Evil is to inflict suffering on to another; out of hate for yourself, to make one hate oneself.

We have three forces pulling us. We all have god, we are god, wisdom. We all have our demons, our path, our philosophy and we all have our idea of perfection that haunts us. 

Everything is spiralling us :)

The 5th dimension is where we are all heading. Where we are all connected at the heart and have empty minds, experiencing things like telepathy.  

This would be heaven. This is where we become free spirits. This is where all our wisdom & philosophy comes from. Everthing has a spirit, all matter and thought are a manifestation of spirit.

Archons are what set the limits on our wisdom & philosophy. 

The greys are the Devine perfect beings from the future that we will all metamorphosis into. They can shape shift, time travel & take hostage in our mind like a parasite. Everything get‚Äôs smaller and closer to perfection. These are what create our negative thoughts the beings preventing us from completing our challenges. They feed off of negative energy; if there‚Äôs no imperfection, they can‚Äôt exist. 

if we don‚Äôt pay attention to spirits, spirits lose their power, so, we can kill death. Fear is a virus, the root of all evil. 

I assume you know what to do. Our purpose is to express ourselves in order to understand ourselves and the universe. I suggest you be yourself. 

An awakening occurs through trauma when our life is shattered because the pain becomes too much or some action alters our perception. All this creates more awareness. It is like a military Sargent shouting at us to pick up all the pieces we have made of our life. 

It would be nice to create a world we don‚Äôt need a military Sargent to become a man but that‚Äôs not reality. 

I could only think the ideal is teachers discipline the children through martial arts and meditation techniques from being young

This is how habits create the man. :) 

We are a result of our life choices.

Knowledge is power.

This means no believe in a god, but I'd apply it further to anything spiritual or supernatural and the like. I ask because those who trip by and large are spiritual to some extent or another. As someone who is an atheist), this can be rather frustrating when trying to interact with others who trip and also are spiritual/religious.

2022-02-04 22:21:17,I kinda like that drugs are illegal,"I mean, it kinda adds something to the experience.

Like how my friend and I went on a two hour road trip to look for mushrooms at various graveyards.

Or that one time I was out in the woods smoking weed with my friends and the police came looking for us because we had crossed some train tracks by foot, and we freaked out because we thought we'd get busted, but we were able to keep our faces straight and they didn't even say anything.

Or how the only way for me to get DMT is to extract it myself, and it has been a whole fucking sidequest to get all the ingredients and equipment, and I haven't even gotten to the challenging part yet.

Or like how the right way to do ayahuasca is to travel to freaking Peru or whatever and paddle down a river for hours and find this shamanic lodge in the middle of the jungle where they make you go through some ancient ritual of healing.

&#x200B;

I'm overall in favour of legalization, but I somehow like how doing drugs can be a challenge. The worst thing that can happen if psychedelics get legalized is that capitalists capitalize on it, and it becomes so easy to buy these things over the counter that we lose this part of the experience...

&#x200B;

Edit: I should add that I am from a very safe and privileged country. I realize that some people are serving harsh, non-sensical sentences for harmless things like marijuana possession. I didn't mean to belittle that, and apologize if this post comes off as doing so. In my culture and context, the fact that this is illegal can be a bit ""fun"" because the consequences of getting busted aren't life-destroying, but in other countries, it is taken so seriously that this would be something that's not to be joked about.

I think the main point I wanted to make is that society has all these structures, and going outside those structures feels very much in line with what doing psychedelics means to me. While I think it should be legal, I kinda feel it shouldn't be completely mainstream and socially acceptable. ",35,2015,7,367,1

2021-08-16 07:55:13,Spirituality without psychedelics is pointless.,"Yeah. Change my view.

I just started wondering if any of those ""spiritual"" freaks are actually using spiritualism as means of actual help or finding meaning of life. And why it doesn't do shit for them. Some of you may have parents focused on that ""magic energy"", parents that are total mess.

I'll leave the case of my mother here. At some point in life she learned about feng shui and other horoscopic crap. She is not a full blown fanatic and I have to confess - I was a dick about it at one point. I straight up told her that it only harms her. It got to a point that no furniture could have sharp corners and we were fighting about practical furniture arrangement. So I had my reasons, but I also wanted to help her - detaching her from that mindset would at least set her a little bit free - that is what spiritualism is about.

Despite all that witchcraftery she is mental wreck. Traumatized, closed, anxious and depressed. She does well in life but has some serious issues with empathy and attachment. Big ego, small to none control over it. She can be a bad person sometimes and never realize it. Fighting with cigs addiciton her whole life. And it doesn't seem to end.

My friend once told me that recently his mother started cleansing the apartment with some kind of incense. This time I was more gentle as psychs taught me some lessons. Maybe she just needs it?

Anyway, to my point - psychedelics are the base of the whole spirituality thing. You don't need to do them all the time, but at least one spiritual experience is required to do that witchcraft hobby properly. In my opinion it's the same as christian religion enlightment scheme. Do X Y times and die. Than you receive the prize - probably nothingness, while people in charge control you and play with your money. All you receive is hope while still suffering, but just being drawn from the conclusion that this suffering is your life. There is nothing more, or at least may not be. If you suffer now it's not a key to heaven, it's wasted potential. 

But once you experience a mushrooms or LSD trip - things change. You realize many things, mostly through emotions which we are not naturally good at as humans. I really believe that this level of emotional development is impossible without use of psychedelics. I've been pretty mind-savvy since the age of 12 trying lucid dreaming, which then developed into psychology interest, now psychedelics and meditation. But I was a mess too. Still am. It's just psychedelics that made me feel alive, still suffering but being happy with that.

Put meditation aside, as it is just a valuable life skill, just like financial or social skills. But all the other things like incense, feeling energies, even chakras, psychedelic art, and other things that I am not aware of are just branches of that tree and the root are psychedelics. Running around the house with incense and arguing about energies without psychedelic experiences is like wearing Nirvana T-shirts knowing only ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". It's just cringe for every Nirvana listener.

Before tripping I'd never seen myself meditating and finding something more in the incense other than nice smell. I think I now understand what is being sold to people as positive energy. It is there, it's just not a thing, it's an emotion. Just like psychedelics can be abused, used for fun, used for self harm, used to escape - as can be spiritualism. You can't just do psychs or witchcraft to boost our ego and expect things to get better - it comes with work. Being nice to other people, getting in touch with your inner child, true self. Moving on in life. Going for a therapy. Truly crying about your past and dealing with it on spiritual level - these are hard things to do - and only psychedelics can really push you to do those.

I guess it is the wrong sub to ask. You are all biased. Try to change my view if you want. Do you know anybody who is abstinent and goes the same path as many of us do, the healthy way?

///Edit: There is no tldr; because it's all my point of view. Some of commenters didn't read it probably.

Anyway, it looks like labeling is the biggest issue here. Just by trying to define spirituality using actions it loses its meaning. I'll label myself as a spiritual person, for me it was because of tripping. Can't label other people, because only they know if they've been somehow enlightened.

2018-01-13 23:09:36,Convince me the psychedelic experience is NOT demonic in nature.,"Hey all! I hope you‚Äôre having a nice Saturday!

I know having your worldview challenged tends to agitate most people so please understand I‚Äôm here to pursue truth just as much as you are. 

So let‚Äôs try and keep things civil before resorting to insults. 

My thesis on psychedelics is that they are a false ‚Äúdivine‚Äù experience in the sense that most psychonauts never question their experiences and tend to accept their ‚Äúinsights‚Äù as truth.

This leads to horrible misunderstandings, psychosis, and inflation that this sub would agree is ‚Äúpar for the course‚Äù. 

So if something spreads so much false information and false insights, it cannot be divine(truth) and is therefore the opposite of divine, demonic.

2022-10-27 19:33:53,No Cell Phone Tripping !," Back in the dinosaur DayZ....
  We didn't have cell phones yideo games YouTube, etc, or Trip Enders !  I know it's hard to imagine the hardship and horror we had to endure....
  But we did have Psychedelics !!! White Lightening, Orange Sunshine, Purple Haze, some of the first and best !  Shrooms, psilocybin, mescaline too.
  You might be curious.... How on earth did we Trip without a cell phone glued to our hand ?
  What did we do when things got weird and we couldn't get on a forum of random strangers to cry  for a safe space ?
  How'd we get thru a 4 Way Hit of Acid
without Trip Killers ???
   No YouTube with millions of Mindless ""Entertainment"" to distract us from communicating and experiencing fully the Medicine and it's Messages. 
How did we survive ?
    
Answer: Any way we could !
We had to rely on Ourselves
and each other. We had to learn to Breathe and ride it out ! 
Had to actually Look at what was happening...
Had to pay Attention to our Set and Setting. 
We were forced to Learn how to find the Good in our Experiences and help each other and ourselves.
   We actually had to Look Deeper, in our selves and Minds to find the Essence and Lessons and Secrets the Sacrament had to share with Us.
 Oh the Horror !

As a result, we got Stronger, Wiser, and more self confident ...
  We explored Deeper into the ""Mystery Schools"" of religions, philosophy, shamanism, physics and metaphysics and Arts, looking for The Answer ! Imagine, we really had to Read Books, in Analog ! Oh My God !
   A lot of the times, we had to Trip in Nature ! 
Imagine the hardship of that !
   Forests and mountains, rivers and oceans, wildlife and birds, doing their Thing.... Crazy ass Hippies running around naked in the Woods, tripping Ballz !
Not a Screen in sight.... Oh the Hardships we endured ...
     Hell we couldn't even pull out a Wireless speaker tied to our Phone and play any music we wanted !
    We had to listen to birds or the Wind or   get lost in the Flow of Water and Crashing of Waves on the beach.... 
   Or ride in a school bus full of tripping Freaks, out rattling the Straights...
  It was rugged...
And made us Stronger, mentally and emotionally...

 Sure, some freaked out, ODd, lost their minds, or wound up in jails and hospitals, as a result of ignorance and stupidity....
     But the rest of us pulled on our Big Boy pants and zoomed on into the Unknown... and managed to invent Apple computers, become Astronomers, start the Health Food revolution, bring Environmental Awareness to the forefront, go down South and join the Civil Rights Movement to work for the Changes we wanted to see...
    Hell, we were so Bored we had to Organize to Stop the Draft and the Vietnam War...
   We were so deprived ! 
We had to attend Free Concerts with the Grateful Dead in Golden Gate Park.
 Man, I don't know how we did it....
    But we managed, and thrived, and started a lot of the Movements y'all take for granted today...

  Not really much point to what I'm sharing here... But maybe something to be Learned and Appreciated by this younger generation ?
   Not holding my Breath.... Happy Trails y'all.",24,3131,5,564,1

2018-12-16 17:20:22,Fun Experiment: Take an Atheist. Get Him High. Place Atheist Inside Church.,"*Wow*, I thought, bracing myself against the freezing cold wind as I exited the car, *I'm really doing this. I'm going to church. Church*. I walked in to the same Catholic church that I attended as a youth (but never before with psychedelics in the system) and as I passed from the hall to the main part of the church itself, skipping the 'holy' water anointing station and hoping I didn't look like an extra on the set of Half Baked I entered what felt like an entirely new dimension- a sense of deja-vu mixed with a rather strong feeling of *I don't belong here and they will know it immediately*. I mean, for one thing, the place was packed and so trying my hardest to *not* feel completely out of place standing in front of what looked like 200 people, all of whom I was certain were all thinking the same thing (*hiss* *an interloper* *hiss*).

....And then there's the fact that I was stoned. Not exactly the most comfortable place to be when you're high but *man* did it amplify the experience. I'll get to that in a bit though. My cohorts and I took a seat. I hadn't sat in one of those seats for years, and it was a church of all places, but I did experience a small sense of a faint whiff of welcoming. My ass recoiled and sighed with familiarity at the same time, but I digress.

We were a few minutes early so I took the time to look around and take in the scene. Like most catholic churches, the place is a strange mix of welcoming and foreboding. The architectural design is aesthetically pleasing and it's clear that the workmanship was solid and finely detailed, but I cannot deny the fact that it did strike me as also being intentionally designed in such a grandiose fashion that it ventured beyond ""look how grand this is"" to perhaps a small (and possibly imagined on my part, sure) hint of ""and look how small you are."" It could be simple cynicism on my part, but as you will soon read, the mass itself also seemed to be designed with the intention of engendering in those in attendance a sense of *less than*. There certainly was a lot of prostrating oneself involved in the actual mass itself.

First and foremost, there's the postural control. Sit. Stand. Kneel. All on command. All I could think to myself as I watched this unfold around me was what exactly *is* the point of all of that and why were people so quick to go along with it? It seems to me that it worked in tandem with the design of the place, the dress employed by those administering the mass, etc. The pageantry of it all obviously celebrates the importance, in their minds, of the message and of their actions, but I can't help but think that a clear message is also (not so) subtly being sent: *You are less than and you will kneel before me*.

Like the aforementioned postural control, there is the perhaps less offensive but more ominous groupspeak, as I thought of it. The priest would say something and then ask for it to be repeated back to him and the entire room, in unison, all murmured in these reverent, hushed tones the same words back to him. It was during these moments that I would think *this would be a risky place to be in some other time periods and/or some other places*. A person like me wouldn't fare so well in some other spots such as the one I was in on this night. A religious version of Children of the Corn played out in my mind as I listened to the murmurings all around me.

*Before I continue, I really have to stress just how utterly surreal this experience was. I'm sitting there literally surrounded by a group of people prostrating themselves in front of a seemingly 147 year old man wearing a cape-dress thing while they murmur in unison as they prepare to cannibalize a 2000 year old dead magician. It was bananas*.

As the members of the church lined up to take communion I wondered how many of them a) knew about the fact that the church states that they really *are* eating Jesus' flesh and b) actually believed that themselves. And if they did, um.....did they not know that cannibalism is illegal? Do they really think they would be allowed to cannibalize someone week after week, right out in the open, when the law states that eating people is not allowed? How did they reconcile the fact that Jesus still tasted, looked and felt exactly like a cracker? Did they ever wonder how the guy never ran out of flesh? Even the best biggest bodybuilder couldn't feed entire congregations worldwide for 2,000 years. (Was Jesus on dat dere cell tech?)

As far as things being said to me, or anything happening to me, as a result of my not partaking in all of the activities around me, I had one person sitting behind me hit my shoulders to tell me to stand up the first time the priest said to stand (not a stranger, someone I know) and I caught a few dirty looks. One from a woman across the aisle and one from a mother a maybe two rows up whose kid pointed to me and then clearly whispered something about how I was sitting when everyone else was standing. It's amazing how clearly the lines between unacceptable and acceptable people are drawn and then how vigilantly they are adhered to. All it takes is for you to sit when others stand and suddenly you're the *other*.

I felt a pervasive sense of wonder mixed with sadness and a touch of despair throughout this whole thing. I know most people would say I was crazy and all that was taking place there was a nice community gathering, but I could not help but see it for its much darker undertones (and really, I think they are only under if you don't bother to look- or don't want to) and be reminded of the ashes of fallen, war torn empires upon which this place of subversion and prostration was built.",75,5686,12,1053,1
2023-02-27 13:29:12,"5 minutes ago, I accidentally ingested over 80 hits of LSD. AMA.","Update : I apologize to everyone for the delayed update. First off, let me me start by thanking all those who kept commenting, you 100% kept me somewhat sane for the first hour. Eventually I was unable to read altogether. 

It's been about 72 hours since the incident. I still feel effects. My vision has small floaters in my far peripheral areas of sight. These behave exactly like dust in your eyes, except these floaters are pitch black and immediately dissappear once I take notice and focus my attention toward them. Light and colors currently seem marginally brighter too, but this effect has dissipated slightly upon waking up each morning, and after two naps. Other than these small issues, I feel wonderful. The only word I can describe my current state, and my immediate state after the hallucinations subsides....Is clarity.

 My mind, soul, psyce, all feel at absolute peace. A calmness one cannot describe. I usually have a very, very active internal dialouge. Most times I cannot control my thoughts, or I suppose a better saying is that my mental focus becomes distracted very fast, and easily. This has all seemed to have changed, to the polar opposite. I can now think smoothly, clearly, calmly, and for extreme lengths of time about one specific subject. I can also branch out with my thoughts, and still remember the ""stepping stones"" of my prior thought chain. All the way up to my current thought. Disseminating all aspects, and exploring all avenues of subjects. I recognize I was in a mental conginitive loop prior. I would think the same things, in the same order, and I'm almost sure at the same times. 

I can't help but feel pure amazement, because it's truly like I am thinking with someone else's brain. I have not felt this emotion since I was a child. The feeling of seeing or learning something brand new, and curiosity and excitement would take complete control.

 Again, it's all so hard to describe. I wish I was able to convey this all more perfect, but its so hard to find the words.


I have had two extremely long days, and I want to type my entire experience, as the best I can remember. It was extremely intense. 

I have been awake for close to 30 hours as I had to travel for work at short notice, this is the reason for my delayed update. Again I apologize, and thank you all for the comments. I will reply to more in the AM, and give another update as well as detailing the entire experience. I did not think this would garner so many likes, because I solely posted to try and keep my sanity.

2023-01-30 03:28:40,Practices for Integrating Psychedelic trips and Fixing your life,"1- Keeping a very clean hygiene, your body is your temple, God dwells within the body, you dare to show him a dirty body?

Shower everyday or two, brush teeth, every few hours wash your face, hands, arms, nose, ears, feet, just pass some water over them

Rub your body clean, till no impurities remain

2- Exercise, Run, do push ups, sit ups, do things that make your body move, 
Listen to the body, not the mind, if possible lift or do martial arts
Break a sweat, you are a Literal Animal! You are supposed to be running hours each day, carrying water, chopping wood, the body cannot work without exercising like a machine rusts without use

3- Good Diet, a good balance, eat high protein food wheter animal or vegetarian, if you eat meat, then eat it and dont waste any! 
You dare to waste food? Eat every single bite! 
if you are vegetarian and need protein try eggs and milk, or if you are a meat eater try to eat less and if you need try to source it well! and Eat every bite, Eat lots of Fruit as well, whatever feels best for your body, keep a balance and stop eating sugar! No sugar! sugar is diabetes and sugar crash mood

If you do this you can keep a good healthy clean body, with little disease, you want to live the end of your life in a deathbed?

4- Keep a TIGHT Sleep schedule

Sleep is the Most Important thing, It is you returning to your Home for a bit of rest from this Difficult world

Are you gonna cut it short? Are you gonna have to wake up in anxiety and stress?

Sleep Early! Wake up Early! Attack the day! Be happy! 
You need Discipline, You need Rules that must not be broken

5-Pray and Surrender your mind to God, Remember God whenever you can

Do some movements of yoga, concentrate while meditating or while working
Enter the flow state
Pray for God's help, for the end of suffering, for knowledge, for whatever you need

6-Practice Silence

When you walk, feel your feet, when you move your body feel the movements, when you sigh feel the sigh, when you laugh feel the laugh
When angry, feel the anger, when loving, feel the love

Be quiet, practice concentration, walk without worrying, walk while deep breathing

7- Attack your problems head on!

Stop letting anything get in your way or procrastinating, Attack the moment, problems are small when they emerge, yet like a sprout becomes a tree, problems become huge if ignored, do what needs to be done immediately!

Some use a 5 or 3  second rule, ""Oh i dont want to do this"" 5...4..3..2..1 GET UP and DO IT

The mind likes to complain, the body knows what to do, it has elvolved for millions of years and is capable of way more than you can imagine, some people can run a marathon if forced yet those same people would be lazy to take out groceries

8-Read and Memorize Scriptures

Memorize key points and Repeat them as a Mantra, or just keep rereading them until you become them, repeat that even if you lost your memories, those words would remain

Repeat in transportation, repeat when suffering, repeat while bored, just whatever words reach you, keep repeating them

9- Fasting

Stop Eating too much, go hours if not days without food so you know the Value of it !

When fasting there are moments of pure bliss, Food disturbs the body sometimes, the body spends effort to digest it especially bad food

Fasting removes the addiction to the pleasure of the senses and help Still the Mind, so Fast for 12h or 24h or 36h or even 72h, drink only water and even water do not do in excess

10- Give in Charity!

You are telling you have no body, no possessions, unattached yet you cannot Give a few bucks to a person who needs it ???

Be the Change you want to see! That someone who is begging is there for you to give him,
 everything that js Bad on your path is made so you would change it

If there was no bad, there would be no capacity to do good

Some people literally spend hundreds of dollars on stupid fuko pops or figurjnes but when its time to help someone EAT and Survive they look down on them

What is 10 dollar given or even 50 or even 100 or even 150, these numbers would scare people yet people spend 3x to 4x on what meaningless things that will never make you happy, Giving makes you happy, the guy who does not have where to sleep having a place to sleep thanks to you makes you happy, whatever you earn, give a bit of it, give 2 or 3%, so God gives back

11-Be Grateful at all times!

Write a list, repeat it, You literally could be in so much pain, you could have been in an accident for so many times

You have so much that other people would dream of, the Blind dream of seeing, the deaf dream of hearing, you have those gifts, you have a good body, 2 hands and 2 legs, what more do you need? Stop desiring and be grateful! The world is beautiful see the beauty

You have a family, be grateful for them, be grateful for friends

12-Practice Kindness! Say only Good words!

Punch yourself if you say a bad word, your time in this world is limited yet you dare to say bad words, either say beautiful words or shut up

13- Keep Your Environment Clean!

You are your environment! The Environment will always Influence you wheter you are blind to it or not, The House needs to be Clean! It needs to smell Good to have Fresh air!

Only Look at Beautiful Things, Your Minds has to have beaufiful Flowers, beautiful Thoughts Blossoming from it!

Make your mind a Temple of Purity! Every thought needs to be Pure

Bad thoughts only come out when you expose yourself to bad stimuli, Therefore for every bad thoughts, Look at beauty, Look at poetry, Be happy

15- GO IN NATURE

Go in the Forest, walk with trees, Look closely at the grass, Feel the Fresh air, feel the wind

Do you know tbat these things will give you more than all the stupid conversations and explanations in subreddits? 

Listen to the birds; walk without music or a phone, if possible even leave your phone at home, if Run, just Go Run! Running makes you happy, fix your life

Be Good and God gives the fruits

16- Clean Your Mind / Hate Lowly Desires

Opposite Thoughts need to be Cultivated, Any bad thought that happen need to have the opposite of it and repeated

Approach people gently, use excuses, just Smile, Be a weirdo its totally okay, approach other people's dogs, use excuses ;)

18- Wear Respectable Comfortable clothes

Be Respectable, you are what you wear, wear good clothes so when people see you, they respect your opinions, not that you need them but again Do Good, Wear Good, Be Good

2018-12-25 22:30:14,Fungus is not from earth,"Here is why:

&#x200B;

\- Fungus does not have gender like every organism on earth. Earth has a certain duality to it that is the balance of life (Day/Night, Male/Female, Positive/Negative, etc ). Instead, gender does not apply to the mushroom kingdom. Mushroom mating is completely different from any animal or plant on this planet.

&#x200B;

\- Fungus makes up about 50% of all living things on earth. Humans make up a tiny fraction of all living things on earth. The fungus is also intelligent enough to stay at 50% in order to maintain this earthly balance and not interrupt the food chain. This means that mushrooms have managed to completely flourish and diversify while living on earth since their migration from another galaxy.

&#x200B;

\- Fungus does not need sunlight, grows on dead matter of earthly organisms (plans, animals), can grow nearly anywhere, does not interrupt culture, and can adapt to any situation.

&#x200B;

\- Fungus have millions upon millions of variations in their DNA. Gender is a non -existant thing for them. They reproduce via a very advanced system of spores.

&#x200B;

\- Every mushroom is connected to each other underground. Let that sink in. They have sort of highways of information that every single mushroom is part of. Sort of like the internet but in a very natural way. This connection is integrated in their DNA.

&#x200B;

\-  Each mushroom has self expression by their colors, shape, size, and location, similar to human civilizations.

&#x200B;

\- They are 100% biodegradable. They literally turn waste into life/energy/self expression. They waste NO ENERGY. 100% efficiency. That isn't something humans have been able to do

&#x200B;

\- Some mushrooms species have psilocybin, a molecule that is very similar to serotonin in the human brain that is capable of completely tripping a person out.

&#x200B;

\-Finally, they do not follow the golden ratio that every earthly organism has. They are circular and look like a nuclear explosion, which is unlike anything on earth. They are not exponential.

A letter to the shadow. A letter to the default subconscious mind 

The ideologies you think you arrive at objectively. They are in fact just a toxic manifestation of human psychology. 

Political issues become a means to calm the anxiety and fear of the inherent chaos of existence and life. To feel in control. To continue to bury and rationalize the shadow. Political issues become a means to stroke and validate ones self and the toxic egocentric shadow. The ‚Äúmorality‚Äù is always subjective and relative in these types of psychological/ideological operating procedures within a society. It‚Äôs not based on inherit good or evil. Not based on objective truths. It‚Äôs based on one thing and one thing alone. Domineering the opposition. All of this being the catch 22 of the cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias involved with Jung‚Äôs shadow. Traditional psychological therapy/clinical psychology is normalized and popularized because people inherently operate within this deeply flawed psychological state of perceiving themselves and the world. Clinical psychology exists by in large to help aid people in this work. The work of moving their subconscious mind to the conscious. Some people go to the grave never making marked progress inside or outside of therapy with this. They go to the grave fully operating within the shadow, these psychological resistances, completely never understanding themselves or their relationships. Much less these broader take aways in life. Or they realize them too late. What religion sought to explain through hyperbole and metaphor, what society shaped and molded into as a result, is a representation of human psychology. It‚Äôs not always fair or true or good, or bad for that matter. It‚Äôs simply a representation of the current state of the mass subconscious which is in turn a representation of the psychology and philosophy dictating steering and molding that society. To put another way. A representation of how aware of themselves the greater majority is. Of how much of the shadow and the maladaptive defense mechanisms are dictating at every level socially and politically. What we are going through now is this protracted period of nihilism that breads and rears these narcissistic undertones in people. The focus never being on the inherent problem with people, because the people are inherently flawed. So they stay in therapy, if they‚Äôre lucky, trying to work through these most common of psychological issues and resistances. Worse yet they are prescribed medications ssri and benzodiazepines that not only prevent that person from ever having hope to journey into themselves and do that shadow work, it creates a lifetime dependency. Prozac Zoloft all these things pumped out to the masses. MILLIONS of people.  Not saying there aren‚Äôt a few who have benefited from rx meds but I think 99% of what it results in is locking a person at a level of understanding and introspective work by doping them up. And since we are all so very intimately connected the affects of that is far reaching and reverberating. People are getting lost without a Pilar of humanity to base them down past and through their own egocentric minds and operating procedures. This human condition. God is dead man has killed him and country by and large makes people feel alienated. So what then is left? What is the basis and leading force then now? What is it replaced by?  The ‚Äútruth‚Äù?  Good always triumphs? Once we have studied and considered  some of the concepts listed above that certainly can‚Äôt be the case. Because again the truth is never truly the truth. And the good is never truly the good. It‚Äôs just a representation of human psychology. Deeply flawed human psychology. How could a minority ever have a voice over such a majority that operates under the heavy self rationalization of the shadow? God and country can‚Äôt answer these conundrums. And science is too regimented and black and white. While this aspect of the human experience, it‚Äôs so internalized. It‚Äôs not of the corporeal experience. It‚Äôs spiritual, or as much such that religion was created in an attempt to represent. People have devoted books to just try and describe these aspects and concepts of society and psychology. The only hope I think is a marriage of spirituality and psychology and philosophy. And through these a cultural revolution would have to take place. Like the genius of Nietzsche saw and understood. A ‚Äútransvaluation of values‚Äù. It‚Äôs a bleak proposition and pretty hopeless one. A Schopenhauer‚Äôs narrow door to the truth. Always there but hidden in obscurity by the deeply flawed nature of the human experience and the great great majority. Poetic coincidental prophetic that these minds spoke and thought in a way that compelled them to delve into these ideas and understandings. A product of their personality type to want to know and help and teach. That these minds exist in abstraction as a means to help usher others. That concept is as old as society I‚Äôm guessing. The medicine man. The prophets. The teachers. These people, these ideas are birthed in the most rare of the introvert personality types. Because they inherently perceive themselves and the world around them in an internalized way. When nurture nature and the journey of life experience coalesce and produce these introvert type of minds and personality types it gives them a leg up on the shadow work. To be able to make these observations of people and themselves. A curse of understanding on those who are forever with people cursed with a lack there of. Just because something is the majority, where by normal, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs healthy. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right. And maybe that‚Äôs part of the conditioning that molds these sort of forced perspectives of these medicine men these √ºbermenschs as Nietzsche put it.  Truly this is the concept Nietzsche tried to establish without all the pieces of modern psychology. Modern psychology based around minds like his, who studied him. That these 1-4% of the population operate in the same capacity they have since the beginning of time.",86,6326,13,1041,1

2023-01-10 21:25:51,ChatGPT Psychedelic Mushroom Trip Story,"I asked chatGPT to create a story about a life changing psychedelic mushroom experience üçÑ this is what it came up with: 

Once there was a young man named Jack who had always been curious about the world around him. He had always been interested in exploring the mysteries of the mind and had heard that psychedelic mushrooms had the power to do just that.

One day, he decided to take the plunge and eat some mushrooms. He found a quiet spot in nature, far away from the distractions of the city, and sat down to have his experience.

At first, everything seemed normal. But then, as the mushrooms began to take effect, the world around him started to change. The colors of the trees and the sky seemed to become more vibrant, and he felt as though he was seeing them for the first time. He also felt a sense of euphoria and connectedness to everything around him.

As he walked through the forest, he had a profound realization that everything in the world is interconnected. He realized that all living things are connected, and that he was a part of that greater whole. He understood that his actions and thoughts impacted the world around him and he felt a deep sense of responsibility to live in a way that would contribute positively to it.

He also recognized that he had been living in his own head, trapped in his thoughts, worries and fears but he realized that in order to be fully present in the world and to truly be alive, he needed to let go of them. He was filled with a sense of peace and understanding that he had never felt before.

The experience changed Jack in a profound way. He left the forest feeling a deep sense of inner peace and understanding of the world around him. He knew that he would never be able to see the world in the same way again and that he would always be grateful for the experience. From that day on, he lived his life with a sense of purpose and connection to the world around him and was always mindful of how his actions impacted the greater whole.

It was truly a life-changing experience for Jack and he will always be grateful for the profound lessons he learned that day.",39,2125,5,393,1
2022-12-26 21:17:51,Trying not to kill myself. 3.5g Explosive Entheogens,"Hi this is the story about my second trip after  a 1g Golden teacher experience i decided to up the dose with another strain my dealer suggested. Explosive entheogens, I mean the name is pretty fucked up. It's a Monday morning and I had pulled an all nighter. I literally could not sleep. I waited for my dad to leave for work. I didn't have much to do that day or so i thought. It's 9 am and i just finished crushing 3.5g of mushrooms and threw it into a shaker filled with ice tea. Oh btw mushrooms smell and taste like ass.

 I chugged the ice tea trying my best not have any explosions from my mouth onto my bedroom floor . Hehe see what i did there. 

I lay in bed, i wanted to go outside but the weather was terrible. Depressing rain. I mean what's more worse than a Monday morning. 

Eyes closed, I started meditating and i slowly lifted off into another world. Heres the weird part I couldn't see it but could feel it. This experience truly traumatized me as i laid in my bed talking to God knows whatever the fuck it was. It's as if i was talking without actually talking. 

During the trip i remember being shown around a mushroom land with huge mushrooms and fireflies flying around. Here's where the story takes a turn. 

After a walk around this mushroom swamp. I see my dealer. Now if you've ever seen Charlie from the chocolate factory you should know about that purple suit he wears with a giant hat. The one that magicians wear. Well guess what, my dealer was rocking that fit in my trip but he was laughing at me, laughing at just who i was and what i was doing. He had a stick in his hand and he continued to laugh. 

*Door opens* My mom just walked in while I'm tripping balls. Her exact words ""spider in my bathroom"". I kid you not I was ready to cry. My mom hates drugs ever since i was a kid she hated them. The last thing that can happen is her finding out that her supposed to be professional son is tripping balls on mushrooms. All i replied was ""ok coming""

 Oh yea and BTW this is about 1hr 15 min  after ingestion im sure you all can imagine what's going on, if not ill try my best to immerse you into this experience. 

I could not let her find out i was destroyed so waited for her to leave. I get off my bed and it hit me. Im fucked out of my mind. Wtf am i doing on a Monday morning. 

I exit my room and i see my mom. 
Man, when i say i saw my mom she looked terrible. Her face was falling apart like play dough . Im keeping it cool and i walk to her bathroom. Oh yea and that was the longest walk of my life. With walls caving on me and everything morphing. 

On the way there i heard mom say somethings but i was so fucked out of my mind I could not understand and this is when i thought i had died. Maybe i was dead, maybe im stuck in this forever. Still gotta keep it cool though. 

We reach the bathroom. This is the scary part for me. I have an inate fear of spiders. I hate those those hairy mtfs with their 8 eyes and legs . I enter and immediately grabbed a cloth and wrapped it around the spider and threw it into the toilet. At this moment in time I was losing me. I was so out of place, so scared that i would give up everything just to feel like me again even it meant getting bit by a spider. I knew my mom was shocked she knows I'd never ever go near that spider. At this point I'm trying my best to stay in reality. 

I scoot off to my room convinced I've lost my mind. I tried holding on and it was working but it just happened in waves. I started crying, thinking to myself about my family, friends, and pets and how I'd never be able to interact with them as i am now mentally unstable forever aka mad. 

I tried to accept it though but it hurt too much. I went onto YouTube looking for bad trip help. It would work for a bit but i still felt mad. I went to the bathroom and stared into the mirror and thought hmm maybe i stuck in hell, an endless loop with a constant sound of a crow and the raindrops touching the earth. Maybe I'm dead and all I need to do is die in hell and come back to life. I sat on my bed contemplating whether im alive or not and   
And maybe if i killed my self I'd be back to normal. Im on Google while tripping balls searching about psychosis and schizophrenia and whether or not I had it. 
 
This trip was getting worse and i really did not want my mom to find out. 

*ring ring * My phone rings and it's my best friend. Relief overtook me and i answered i said, 
""i took it bro""  my friend immediately answered and said that he was going to come pick me up. I begged him to do so and told him how i felt. The rain had cleared up and I ran outside the trip was subsiding now. The sun was aiding me. 
My friend drove me to his house where i felt so much more safer and waited for everything to return to normal.

2022-09-06 17:31:15,Feeling like you're a god on psychedelics. Is it the dissolution of the sense of mortality?,"I've never had the experience of feeling like I was a god while tripping but last night I was pretty high (cannabis edibles) and I felt like I had an idea about what may be happening when someone is having that experience. I may be totally off on this but I'm curious to know if there's anything to my hypothesis.

I feel that humans live with a constant sense of doom, the knowledge that we are mortals. Every passing second is a second that is gone forever from our lives. Sometimes we think about this consciously and sometimes we momentarily forget about it. But for most of our lives, that sense of mortality is in our minds. If not at a conscious level, it exists at the subconscious level. 

I'm postulating that the idea of mortality exists as a filter in our minds and sometimes this filter is dissolved while tripping, the way other filters and barriers are dissolved.

And when someone is having this experience, they become confused and believe that they are a god because they now feel immortal.

For those who have had this experience, does this make any sense?",91,1075,16,193,1

That takes a lot of courage to go to that extreme.  The mass of human consciousness lives in an agreement of bullshit egocentric notions of love.  Swimming against this consciousness current is quite overwhelming.

Like me, some people have no choice but to figure out life without an ego.  I chased my ego for a decade and it's story became so ludicrous I couldn't accept this reality with such a ridiculous premise.  It was either or awaken or dispatch of my meat suit.  

I awakened prior to my first real psychedelic experience.  I've taken a year to adjust to this new reality.  What I can say is that you can live transparent and loving in this world.  You have to find yourself the greatest authority, otherwise the muggle mind will once again permeate your world.

2021-02-26 05:07:56,ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TANTRA,"ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TANTRA

I have an ancient soul that remembers a great deal about achieving higher states through mutual orgasm with another. 

This post is based on a specific mediation and enlightening experience that anybody can achieve by simply following the steps and visualizing the necessary pathways of energy. 

Tantra focuses on the desired goal of prolonging an orgasm in order to prolong the feelings of incredible ecstasy. 

From the post on Sacred Sexuality I detailed that a continual state of ecstasy would allow our bodies to feel a small glimpse of what it means to exist in the fascinating highs of a Creator. 
From these origins I am now going to teach you how to achieve a more beneficial pathway to direct your sexual energies whilst having sex in order to promote highly powerful experiences from the moment of orgasm. 

With this knowledge itself, you are already beyond most teachings of commercialized forms of Tantra that solely focus on sexual relief and heightened pleasure.

My technique is based upon 3 fundamental parts that come together to form what is known as Ancient Egyptian Tantra: 1) Breathing, 2) Visualization, and 3) the Physical Orgasm. 

This technique becomes more powerful with every time you apply its teachings, and it may be wise to learn the basics by yourself before moving on to coordinate the teachings with a partner. 

I have found that it is actually easier to time your own personal orgasm by yourself rather than relying on the sexual activities of your partner. I would also like to clearly state that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you apply this technique between heterosexual or homosexual couples so long as one party has a predominantly masculine energy whilst the other has a predominantly feminine energy. 

It is completely normal to find men expressing feminine energy at its finest and vice versa.

1. Breathing
It is firstly important to get our breathing into a certain more beneficial pattern so as to prolong the time it takes to orgasm. 
Inhaling long and deep breaths regulates our energies to move slower and take in more energy whilst breathing. 

Complete Breathing is a method used to breath with the full capacity of the lungs rather than just the top portion or bottom portion. 

If you would like to read more information about the correct forms of breathing, please refer to a free online book called The Science of Breath by Yogi Ramacharaka. 

The specific techniques on learning to breath Complete Breaths with both the bottom portion and top portion of the lungs is the most important part. Until that moment in time then just learn to time your breathing at regular intervals of 8 seconds, 10 seconds or 12 seconds. 

What this means is that you should practice separating your breathing into 4 parts; inhaling, holding, exhaling, holding. This practice of counting to 8 while inhaling, hold your breath for 8 seconds, exhaling to the count of 8, and then holding your negative breath for 8 seconds, will induce a greater amount of energy capture within your lungs as well as increasing your metabolic rate. I normally even start sweating by just breathing in such a certain way.

You do not need to breathe in a 4-part cycle whilst performing this Ancient Egyptian Tantra, all you need to do is breathe slowly and deeply until the visualization part where you have to breathe in and hold your breath whilst visualizing the flow of energy. The 4-part cycle teaches you however to maintain your breaths whilst consciously visualizing energy patterns.

I should also mention that deep and very slow breaths takes your mind off having sex and also prolongs the length of time it takes to orgasm as your mental focus is now upon a different aspect of yourself.

2. Visualization
The visualization aspect of this mediation is the most important. In order to understand how the visualization works, you will firstly have to be quite familiar with the layout of your Chakras and understand what they do.

The most important ones to focus on for this meditation are the Root Chakra (Red), Heart Chakra (Green) and Crown Chakra (Indigo Pink). 

For those who are advanced enough, the 8th Chakra or 12th Chakra should be used for the arching visualization rather than any of the other three. 

Only 3 Chakra points will be focused upon for this meditation; The Root Chakra, the Heart Chakra and either the Crown Chakra, 8th Chakra or the 12th Chakra depending on your level of spiritual ability. If you do not know where the 8th Chakra or 12th Chakra is located, please focus on the Crown Chakra. 

The visualization will always start with the Root Chakra, weave through the Heart Chakra and arch over your head through one of the divine Chakras (Crown/8th/12th). 

The visualization should be in the shape of an Egyptian Ankh.
Normally the point of orgasm sends energy up from our Root Chakra and directly out of our Crown Chakra in a straight line out of our body. 

The biggest problem with this normal course of energy is that all of that enlightening momentum is completely lost after the point of impact, with only the residual chemicals left over that have been released by our brain to stimulate an incredible sense of relaxation. 

The Ancient Egyptian Tantra aims to direct the flow of energy from the Root Chakra, through the Heart Chakra and upwards to arch through the Crown Chakra, and finally back down in the Heart Chakra to reconnect the energy in an infinite loop. 
This loop of energy aims to sustain the enlightening momentum of the orgasm into the circular flow of a loop through the highest of our Chakras. 

This meditation connects our grounding Chakra with our divine Chakra and simulates direct enlightenment in one swoop of incredible energy. 

The Heart Chakra is the only useful interweaving Chakra point for us on Earth for it directly pushes out Unconditional Love in a more beneficial cycle.

Now instead of visualizing the top loop going from left to right, it will be visualized as leaving the Heart Chakra out from your back, to loop backwards and up to the Crown Chakra, to then loop forwards and down in the front of your chest back into your Heart Chakra.

In order to combine both the breathing and visualization parts, please follow the following mediation technique:

1) Take very slow and deep breaths, and concentrate upon controlling your breathing.

2) Whilst inhaling a deep breath, visualize golden energy shooting up from your Root Chakra and into your Heart Chakra. Breathe in to approximately 90% of the capacity of your lungs.

3) When this initial burst of energy meets your Heart Chakra, hold your breath and then shoot the golden energy out of your back and loop it up to your Crown Chakra.

4) Once this golden energy meets your Crown Chakra, explode/open your Crown Chakra with a burst of Indigo Pink light, and then proceed to trace those golden energies forwards in a downward loop to reconnect them with your Heart Chakra.

5) Just before the golden energies re-enter your Heart Chakra, breathe in the final 10% till your lungs are at 100% capacity to help the golden energies reconnect back into your system.

6) Slowly exhale in a very controlled manner. This is usually the most gratifying part, releasing your extremely charged breath and allowing the orgasmic energies to swirl through your 3 most important Chakras.

Repeat steps 1-6 a couple times before sexual intercourse, and a couple times during sexual intercourse in preparation for the moment of the orgasm. 

At the moment of the orgasm, shoot those powerful energies into your Heart Chakra, out of your back, through your Crown Chakra, and reconnect them from the front of your chest. 

It is particularly easier to perform this mediation by yourself as the timing of the breathing and visualization can be completely controlled by yourself. 

It is also absolutely fine to practice this mediation during masturbation. 

If you are performing this mediation with a partner, when you initially shoot up your orgasmic energies from your Root Chakra and into your Heart Chakra, explode your Heart Chakra open and connect your Heart Chakra with your partner (assuming the missionary position). 

This link will allow for a very deep felt orgasm, very enlightening indeed.

For those who are particularly advanced, sub in the 8th or 12th Chakra instead of looping your energies through the Crown Chakra. It allows for a much larger explosion of energy whilst hitting the 12th, however this takes some practice.

3. Physical Orgasm
The final part is the Physical Orgasm itself. The first two parts were designed to help induce a very powerful orgasmic experience and to then direct those energies into a very beneficial route that exploded open some of our most divine Chakras. 

This final part is relatively simple in comparison as its mainly about how to stimulate a deeper orgasm.

You will find it very useful to perform the visualization a couple times during the process of trying to achieve an orgasm. More specifically, perform the visualization as you nearly climax your energies, to then stop stimulating yourself and/or each other, and gently relax those energies with the visualization itself. 

This process of working yourself or your partner up to a near-climatic point, and then relaxing back down a couple times, will allow for a very large orgasmic experience when you finally release those built-up energies. 

For men in particular it will be quite hard to settle yourself down whilst nearing an orgasm, for the masculine climax is very hard to tame whilst in its peak.

Whilst sharing mutual pleasure, it is very important to communicate with each other whist nearing an orgasm. Most won‚Äôt know when to back off, especially if we can‚Äôt feel the rising energies in another person.

It is rare for two people to orgasm and climax at the exact same time, however this is the ultimate form of this meditation; dual climatic points exploding their enlightening energies together in a powerful experience of Oneness. 

Please be patient for such an uplifting moment in time, as it is perfectly fine to allow one party to orgasm first and to then work on your partner so they may experience the same result.

Once you have experienced an orgasm whilst using this form of Ancient Egyptian Tantra, you will never want to just release the normal way ever again. 

This form of mediation is addictive and very deeply powerful. It is not something you can take lightly and then forget about later, those depths will stay with you. It is like tasting the true form of an art that has never been shown to you before. 

This technique will reignite your passions for sex. 

That magic, that ecstasy still swirling within your mind, the uplifting of energies that provides more color and feeling to an already highly sensual act, it will change you. 

You master this technique and you will be changed. 

If more people experienced this kind of ecstatic relief, there would seriously be fewer problems in the world.",23,11010,3,1857,1

2020-09-20 00:41:56,I am god,"I am god. I created this universe to live ""my"" life, and further into my life, I will gain the power of god. Be it through technology or direct inheritance. This Earth is so amazing, all the human history that has happened up to this point is so interesting. And my life in its own uniqueness is the absolute best. I have experienced much while tripping, once I met god himself. But it was actually me but just in the future. I fist bumped god, and in that vein of logic, I would eventually be him fist bumping my tripping self. But my memory has been wiped of any omnipotence that being god would provide because then that would be boring. I (Past me) made me (Now me typing this post) forget it all and have this version of my life play out in a really specific way. It's like replaying a video game but brainwashing yourself to not remember any of your previous playthroughs and also brainwashing yourself to make the specific decisions to make this life a unique experience of ""my life"" to archive in my god memory. And I don't have any god power to manipulate this universe because that would be cheating.

I love aesthetics, American suburbs is the best aesthetic, and that's why I'm cataloging all these different versions of my life. To have experienced all the aesthetics that I possibly could, every little variation. No opportunity cost, because I will redo every opportunity to not miss anything. I'm honestly very glad that I don't really know it all. I've had plenty of time to philosophize about it while tripping and I've become existentially bored of existing, to the point of desiring suicide because there is nothing left to experience.

And now I'm here to tell you I know that it's not real. It just feels so absolutely real from my experiences tripping. I've gone where most haven't in the tripping space of going into the >1000ug trip range. And that makes me feel really alone in the tripping world because I haven't found a single person that takes as much as I do so no-one can truly relate to my thinking. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I feel so alone because no-one I've spoken to can even comprehend the kind of experiences I've had. It's so so so so annoying. And if I actually am god? Because what I've seen is like reality bending stuff(My perception of reality didn't change, reality itself changed. Like atoms physically moved drastic amounts that manipulated the physical world around me). That's what makes me believe it in the bottom of my heart. I find it to be true, and if it is? I couldn't even handle that. I would be so scared. I am scared. I hope it's not true. I hope I'm not special and amazing. Because the loneliness you experience as a god is something I cannot bear. And since all other humans are just my creations they might as well not be real. I wish I had someone real to talk to. The ideas of someone else are what I want. I don't want to be alone.

And by god I don't mean the equivalent of any religion's god(s). I'm not the Christian or jew or Islam or Muslim or Buddhist or shinto or whatever the fuck god. I am me, everything is me. I created those gods in effect of humans choosing to believe in them. What was before me? There was no such thing as ""before"" before me. It has always been just me. And I hate it",8,3275,3,609,1
2020-07-21 18:56:21,Psychedelics at a young age?,"Been doing psychedelics for almost 2 years now and I learned a lot about myself and life in general but I'm not sure if this is a good thing to keep doing because I'm only 18 years old. My mental health is perfectly fine and I can probably handle a heroic dose which I really want to do someday, I just don't know if I should wait until I'm 25 so my brain is completely developed.

My highest mushroom dose was 3.5 Grams which was really intense but also beautiful and highest LSD dose was 250 mics.

I've been thinking about taking more and maybe even alone and meditate to learn more about psychedelics and their powers but I am worried that it's going to cause anything in my brain because of my age. Like I said I really think I can handle a ""bad trip"" and I've already done psychedelics alone but my underdeveloped state of my brain concerns me and I really don't want to permanently damage it. Especially because I took them fairly often, like once or sometimes even twice a month.

2020-05-21 13:39:02,Am I an idiot for being against psychological pharmaceutical drugs?,"I think that anti depressants are especially one of the things that hold people back; due to the principle of the nature of medicine, because taking medicine proves something is wrong with you that you cannot fix. I think that nearly all drugs used for psychiatric purposes are made to pacify people and force them to believe that they are naturally unfixable. The truth is that our connection to this Earth is our path of truth, light and enlightenment. No matter how fucked up you get, as long as you have connection to your senses you can use the senses to not live a depressed life. Appreciate each and every one and bless yourself. Love yourself because no one else will really do it for you. Growing up I begged my mom to put me on antidepressants but I am very glad that she didn‚Äôt. The best anti depressant of all was actually getting out of the house. I would have never relearned to find happiness within myself if not for psychedelics. It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúchemical imbalance‚Äù but rather a lack of understanding that I need myself to keep my own head high. So basically fuck mind pills.

2020-05-21 08:15:45,Sexual fetishes may be your soul purpose.,"I've come to the conclusion that one valid perspective on existence is that ""god""/source/the universe made us to fulfill its sexual desires *through* us, be they tame inoffensive fetishes (such as liking toes) to morally offensive fetishes (such as gore & pedophilia). Otherwise, why would god allow such? If love is all, then all is love. I've concluded that *anything ever* has the potential to be fetishized be it by nature (neurological genetic development) or nurture (learned behavioural patterns). 

I think ""god"" (I have to iterate everytime I do not mean an specific religion's god, but mean god in a more eastern spiritual Alan Watts-esue sense) has a sexual fetish for every.

Where as there are two poles of seeing everything through Love & Fear, there is also the Sex & Death dichotomy, where everything exists in a state of sex & death constantly simultaneously.

I believe we humans have created moral objectivism (as objectivity is subject to any one perspective, making the mere idea of objectivity a subjective idea) as a way to combat the nature of source, wherein exists the source of all perverted thought and ideas of which may or may not manifest within a human being naturally.

So, as an incarnation of an aspect of source, you may exist solely to experience sexual deviation. Your soul purpose may be to bust a nut to whatever it is that gets you off before you inevitably pass on. Either that or to resist the temptation, *(""Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"")*

Is it any suprise that priests, who are meant to be closest with their idea of God are plagued with sexual deviance, tortured by ""demons"" manifest as an insatiable sexual attraction to those whose innocence and divinity they are meant to protect?

That's one example of this idea that we exist to give in or resist any sort of perversion inate in us. 

**IN SHORT:** *I'm contemplating whether humans have come as far as we have due to resistance to our perverted nature, or due to secretly giving into them. What do you think?*",41,2038,7,351,1

2020-04-22 15:45:42,Please read! I believe this post of physics and nature is worth your time,"Life is a beautiful endless series of animated matter collisions, guided by gravity and attraction. Interpreted as reality.

Reality is gifted to you by someone else, and your actions right now influence the reality for someone else, either by autonomy or invention. The fact that you can eat and have food / water /shelter was made possible by a community of other people‚Äôs past actions. Living today is made possible by ‚Äúthem‚Äù.

Scientists have proven that observation (consciousness) influences the dual behavior of light, waves and particles. Observation causes particles to build up over time, changing from its resting state as a wave. That means that the observer created the spherical shell of reality around them, bending light.

It‚Äôs called the double slit experiment, I HIGHLY suggest you look it up.

Getting back to food, say someone is out in the fields laying tomato seeds. They cannot see past their current actions, but they are allowing life to exist in another person for just a bit longer. By creating a life sustaining food, they create sustenance and enable another day of reality for someone else. 

Life is a living series of habits, automatic in nature. You need to perform certain actions to live another day. You have to eat breathe drink and sleep to extend your consciousness‚Äô survival.

Time serves as a construct to let those two actions of farmer and consumer to live so distantly from one another, but a spherical black hole is created as a bridge to connect their separate happenings.

I truly don‚Äôt believe in free will. Scientists have even proven that external stimuli influences your perception subconsciously, which causes you to form an automatic response without consciously thinking. 

Your brain is already firing the signals in response to external stimuli around you. They cause you to act before you physically interpret the reality happening constantly, and recognize a learned pattern of movement / action into a new memory.

Even now, you are reading this and are being guided into a new timeline of events and actions from here. Your life will never be the same now that you have read this.

Gravity is all around us. The random noise you hear outside your window. The attraction you feel toward a beautiful person. All of these happen without your decision making, and you are forced to interpret their pull and meaning in a way that makes sense to you. 

But don‚Äôt get me wrong, you can exert gravity and attraction too, using the tool of a body to perform actions and influence. However, I believe any conscious decision (made without stimuli) is a matter of the gravitational pull of the stored memories guiding how you should act. Every memory I personably have has been building up to my present knowledge, which is making me write this post. 

Fear happens when you try to control the process and avoid stimuli. Its hiding. It‚Äôs trying to know better than the embryonic sac of reality.

But don‚Äôt. Let go. Submit to the destiny that shapes and molds you. Pain will come to your conscious doorstep whether you want it or not, but know that you are growing beyond it. Trust in what is given to you, because it‚Äôs all about US.

This is OUR experience, there is no longer me vs you. 

Conciousness is not the end all be all of your existence. You want to think that it is as a survival technique, but the matter and chemical elements inside you live forever. Matter cannot be destroyed, it purely transforms into other matter or energy. 

Conciousness is the gift of perception, a sightful and insightful capacity to absorb gravity and give it back. All the matter inside you has been around since the Big Bang, and will always exist in the closed system that is the universe.

Death purely affects consciousness. You cosmically came from everything, gathered together for a fleeting breathe of consciousness and will pass through into everything around you. Around 14 trillion years have already gone by without your knowing.

Even now, you experience an energy transition without possibly seeing it. Your body heat is transferring itself into the temperature of the air and room around you. Metabolism and energy absorption (eating) is a matter of keeping the heat inside you. Heat is a physical property of nature. The soul needs heat to survive as consciousness. Eat brings in new heat to the body, water and oxygen (oxygen) distributes it, and sleep prolongs it in a low power mode until new energy comes in.

The number of matter collisions is randomized and infinite. Don‚Äôt worry about it though, let the gravity of reality wash over you ü§ó",73,4599,14,782,1

2019-07-11 23:31:10,High dose psilocybin and my ongoing erotic encounters with Baphomet,"Over the past few months I have taken 3 high dose psilocybin trips where I have encountered an entity which I believe to be Baphomet. (2 on 8 grams and 1 on 10 grams of psilocybe cubensis)

During both 8g trips, I was serving as a guide to others who are less experienced with psychedelics. While I did perceive the entity on both of those trips, I had to keep myself grounded for the sake of my companions and I wasn't able to lean into the experience and interact with it. However, during the 10g trip, I spent the peak lying down in silent darkness and experienced full blown spiritual-sexual union with the entity. It was absolutely beyond description, or possibly even conception, but I will do my best. 

The first indication of the entity was a wave of sexual energy. This manifested as me getting physically and psychologically aroused and as my companions making some very out of character suggestive comments. 

Next, I began to see the energy manifest itself visually as a 3D fractal structure with motifs of pentagrams, five-way symmetry, and crescents throughout. This fractal contained every color of the rainbow, but was primarily dark purple. 

I was overcome with a feeling that I was in the presence of something truly awesome, ancient, and powerful. Have you ever met someone and been totally taken by their charisma? Imagine that but a billionfold stronger. I was filled with a desire to love, serve, and worship the presence. I am normally a dominant, individualistic person, so this is extremely out of character for me. 

That was as far as things got on the 8g trips, but on the 10g trip, I explored the presence further. This culminatinated in the fractal energy condensing into the form of a goat-headed, goat-legged, winged humanoid (seen with my eyes closed while lying in bed). It was magnificent, glorious, and supernaturally charming. The entity psychicly indicated that it wanted to merge with me. At first, I resisted out of fear, but I eventually decided that it would be stupid to pass on the opportunity. I was seduced.

I don't really have words to describe the peak of the encounter because it was very abstract, bizzare, psychological and nonconceptual. Let it suffice to say that it was mystical, dionysian, and intensely erotic. There were elements of dominance/submission, teasing, and of gratification held just barely out of reach. I was writhing in ecstasy.

For the sake of brevity I have ommited much. I will answer questions if anyone is interested though. I would love to read people's comments. Do you think this was Baphomet? Has anyone had any similar experiences?

Beyond being pleasurable, I learned so much from these experiences about how to be charming, charismatic, and seductive. I don't want to give away to much, but I will share the only linguistic communication from the entity:

2019-02-17 12:01:58,Is it possible Psychadelics don‚Äôt work on me or is it my SNRI?,"Hi fellow psychonauts,

I‚Äôve been reading this thread for months and learned a lot so I finally decided to create an account and ask a question.

Background:
I‚Äôve suffered from depression for over 15 years and recently learned about the power of Psychadelics to heal this condition. I‚Äôm feeling so desperate as I‚Äôve tried everything over the years and don‚Äôt want to live like this anymore.

I am on Wellbutrin/bupropion, but only 150mg per day. Over the past few weeks I have been reducing it slowly to 75mg p/day.

Objective:
I was hoping to rewrite my brain to be hopeful and positive and I want to have a wise realisation that stops my depression and makes me see the absurdity of my limited beliefs that make me depressed.

Recent experiences

Shrooms:
I tried microdosing with shrooms about 2 months ago for 2 weeks and didn‚Äôt notice any impact other than I wanted to walk and be outside more and I was more punctual for things.

I tried to trip with 1.75g (dried) after about 2 weeks of microdosing a couple of times per week. All that happened was at the 1.5 hour mark, i got a bit sad thinking about how it must be so sad for my mom that all her kids moved away, next I saw some very cool visuals dancing to the music I was listening to. There were no wise or deep realisations and everything was over within 3 hours.

A few weeks later I tried 3g of mushrooms and the experience was very similar to the 1.75g trip. I just got a lot more sad thinking about all the people I have known who have died and who will die in the future. Then I saw more very cool visuals dancing to my music. Nothing deep learned. The whole thing was over in 3 hours.

I have a friend who microdoses and trips with this same type of shrooms and she uses far less than I have for powerful impacts.

MDMA:
A trusted source gave me a portion of mdma and said it was a good amount and to take about 3/4 of it for a good first trip.

I took 3/4 of it and waited 1.5 hours, nothing happened except my pupils were dilated and my jaw got chompy. So I took the remaining amount. Nothing happened.

LSD:
A couple of weeks later, I got some LSD that I was told was 150ug per tab. I tested it before I tried it. I cut it up and approximated that I was taking 30ug my first time. Nothing happened. A few days later I took what about 70ug and nothing much happened. I felt a bit spaced out, but I did not feel high or elated or anything. I actually felt extremely sad and at about the 3 hour mark, I was ugly crying about how alone I feel in the world. I got really hungry about an hour after dropping and at about the 4 hour mark after dropping and ate at both times. After about  5 hours, all LSD effects were done and i had no problem sleeping at about 1:30am.

Question:
Is it possible for Psychadelics to have no impact on someone? Could my small amount of Wellbutrin/Buproprion be blunting the effects of all of these? All my research says that SSRIs blunt effects, but this is not as SSRI, it‚Äôs an NDRI, which does not do anything to the serotonin receptors in one‚Äôs brain. (I called it an SNRI in the title, but have now corrected that it‚Äôs an NDRI, but I can‚Äôt edit the title).

TL/DR
I‚Äôve tried a bunch of Psychadelics to heal my depression and they‚Äôve hardly had any impact. Can I be immune to Psychadelics or is my low dose NDRI be the thing getting in the way?

Edit: formatting.

Edit: I corrected that it‚Äôs a Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) not an SNRI as I originally called it.",62,3487,13,663,1

Not to get into paradise. At that point, all good deeds become selfish deeds. People should want to be good to each other so that we can all be happy and live peacefully but so many people act out of greed due to their own religious views.

2015-12-13 08:37:23,A Theory,"Ultimately everybody who reads this post will be into something of altered consciousness, novel thought, or different ways of thinking. The whole idea of being a Psychonaut is about going outside of the normal bounds of thinking -- outside of the regular box. 

I'm going to throw a few things at you. Succession like. I wonder if you'll be able to connect a few of these mental dots. 

--------

First is now. NOW will be eternal, whether I know it or not. NOW has to be a place. It must be! As if NOW was ""not"" then there would be no I AM. NOW is a place that constantly changes and yet remains the same.

I AM is the start of any and every thought I will ever have. I AM hot. I AM cold. I think therefore, I AM. Kind of thing. Everything else outside of NOW and I AM is merely preference. 

NOW I AM done with part 1. 

---------

Where is the original box that we were talking about to begin with? Are you already aware of all of that last little segment I just attempted to explain? If not, re-read. Re-understand. Re-remember. You KNOW this! It's just YOU pretending to *not* know. 

Sorry. The Law of One dictates firstly: do what thou wilt. From there, it will fall under two categories: service to self or service to others. 

Despite anything that you do. You will serve your self or others. There is no way to act OUTSIDE of that. As that is all what we are, within right and wrong, black and white, in and out -- ONE. 

WE ARE ONE. WE ARE I AM. WE ARE, I AM. 

^^ all of those are magical phrases. all of those carry mad weight in the astral realm and further. those words are the key. 

---------

Part III may look a little odd. All of these part 1, 2, and 3 have been words! Psychonauts often deal in substances and trip reports. Well. If you can get through this one, you've already read another one. 

Right now I AM tripping on serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and maybe a little THC. This is my experience NOW! Because of all of those chemicals, I AM. 

Without those chemicals I AM nothing. I AM not. But as a ""not"" or as a ""nothing"" there is literally NO - THING. Like. It's a thing... that's NOT! 

Imagine an absence of light! What is the absence? It's obviously not what WAS... but what NOW ISN'T. 

Merp. I promised chemicals. Substances. However you, your body, IS A SUBSTANCE. Defined of chemicals. Defined by thought. How do you define your ""mind""? Is it your brain? Is it the brain functioning? Is the response of a functioning and learning brain that analyzes memes and patterns? Is it a brain that responses to something entirely non-physical and acts as a receiver? 

Ugh. Chemicals. Let's add some definitions, boundaries, here NOW. How about chemicals NOT normal to my body chemistry. Let's start adding things that inherently may fit, but originally not there... 

Woot! LSD! 25i! Mushrooms! 4-ACO-DMT! DOM! DOB! You name it! Hallucinogens were/are my world. I love them! They alter my normal brain chemistry and let me see things that normally I wouldn't. 

Let me think a way that I normally would not! That's the original idea that we had here. Attempting to think outside of some sort of ""box"" or original ""idea"". But first we had to know the basics! How and where does ""thought"" SIT? 

NOW I AM! NOW I AM a thought! NOW I can know that I know! And even know that I don't know!!! At least NOW I AM... if nothing else! 

--- 
Part IV

My favorite chemical is DMT. Specifically endogenous DMT secreted off of our own routines and habits. 

I've had DMT trips from orgasms. I've had DMT trips from freebase crackpipes. I've had DMT trips after exercising. DMT is a natural molecule or chemical found in almost EVERYTHING. 

DMT is our end-game. It's how we start. Arguably there is trace elements of it in our blood at all times to enable dreaming. To enhance cognitive function. 

It is naturally blood-brain barrier O-K. Like. It's in and out within 15 minutes without any sort of long-term side effects; except from appreciating your life more; learning new perspectives on what you thought your reality to be. 

I've had DMT trips freebase where I have clearly spoken to entities on different planes of existence. That is where all of this knowledge comes from. 

Believe it or not -- that is ultimately up to you.

2015-10-16 21:50:55,I'm enlightened guys ... haha,"I am enlightened. But I'm not. I just can't believe that I am because it is such an exalted concept. Surely I cannot be that? Because I'm not, and knowing that is why I am. It is counter intuitive. It is also wrong. But it is expressing itself through this person. A transformation of some kind, arising from insight.

It is confusing to the person even. But it is clear. Absolutely mind bogglingly amazing. The extent of the insight. How deep it goes. How dynamic it is. How it erases itself from moment to moment as the stream of time flows. It is not human, because it isn't using the human's vocabulary to describe itself.

It is not anything. It can be anything. It can be the opposite of what I'm describing. It creates everything. This is amazing. It is not the experience I'm even having. It does not belong to this human. He is just blabbering.

Where is it coming from? It's coming from me. Liberation that I will never call liberation.

And it can never end. It doesn't have a start.

Keep this person from going crazy with excitement. It's like the lucidity of a lucid dream that excites someone for a second until they suddenly become immersed in the dream again.

2015-05-03 12:50:30,I just experienced my first full body orgasm yesterday. It was breath-stealing. [x-post from r/sex],"I am a 24 year old dude that has been doing yoga for a while and am becoming a awesome saint in the tantric path. You guys have been an awesome part of my journey and I love how receptive everyone is here to everything. It's wonderful and I hope it never changes. 

Anyways I've been seeing this girl lately. Her personality is awesome. I value our relationship more than anything else and honestly sex would just be a huge cherry on the top of our relationship if either of us ever got the courage to discuss it. Sex would be awesome period, it's been enough time being celibate and I try to find creative ways to challenge the energy like writing or exercising.  

Anyways for whatever reason I decided to masturbate while thinking of her. I'm writing this now so it's fresh in my memory but it was definitely a full body orgasm and eclipsed everything I ever experienced before sexually. The release was nothing short of mind-blowing. 

First my breath took on a life of it's own as I imagined her above me. I couldn't stop breathing deep and hard, I just kept having air fill into my lungs as my mind processed this image that seemed to provoke every sensible nerve and erotic longing. As I kept breathing my chest started heaving and my face and the tips of my shoulders become really hot. I almost wanted to look in the mirror to see if my face is red. This lasts for a moment and goes away my chest is still heaving but this time my head is craning up like I was trying to get up without using my arms, it's hard to imagine. It was more feminine than anything, in fact it looked like a typical female orgasm in a good porno. What I remember next is my arms becoming numb and a tingling sensation over taking them, exactly the same sensation as if my leg went to sleep and small pins and needles followed.  Next a guttural groan just possesses my throat and my legs start spazzing out as everything within them clenches to keep my body from exploding apart.  It was so powerful it was almost numbing. 

Anyways I collapse on my sofa just chuckling at myself as I am just so totally spent and satisfied. I never got naked, in fact now I gotta do laundry and take a shower. But chuckling to myself a weird voice just kept laughing out the words, ""she's the one"" over and over.  The post-orgasm after glow kept me on the couch lying in my own satisfaction for who knows how long, I didn't care as I caught my breath and could barely make sentences. 

Anyways I'm going crazy and I'm not even here to get relationship advice, I'm comfortable with our growth in our relationship and simply pray that there will never be a plateau no matter if it becomes sexual or not. I just wanted to offer my experience that there is such a thing as a full body orgasm if. Life is crazy and sex is what makes it that ways sometimes, I love all of it. 

She's not here right now and I don't think she needs to know that she's responsible for my first full body orgasm but I am so grateful for her existence even if for this one perfect and loving orgasm pray-fully followed by many others.

2014-08-16 13:26:57,Any metalheads on here? Looking for advice on listening to metal while tripping.,"I've been getting into metal recently (mostly of the folk/melodic death variety) and I've been thinking of putting on some of my favourite albums next time I trip (probably on mushrooms or 2C-E). I'm used to listening to flowery, friendly electronic when I trip so this would be a big change of pace. I'm mostly worried about possible bad vibes from songs about satan and death and the general dark intensity of the genre. I know I can always change the music but I think it would be a cool experience. I mean, half the time I can't understand the lyrics anyway, and the other half of the time they aren't in english, so there's that.

I just love the dark aesthetic and richness and depth of sound that melodic death and folk metal offers (c'mon, pan flute woven into immense, heavy guitar riffs and growls is a pretty unique listening experience), and I think it would be a cool trip to have that dark, gothic vibe. Would there be any substances that lend themselves to enjoying that sort of music without freaking out? I don't want to bitch out and throw on 'Flowers' by Nujabes instead of 'To the Gallows' by Kalmah because the latter spooked me.

Edit: Guys... ***I don't want recommendations for albums***. I have lots of albums that I like. I want to know some tips for being able to enjoy death metal while tripping balls without freaking out and turning it off.

2013-04-02 02:47:28,Artist/Shaman/Psychonaut/Loner,"I'm not trying to brag at all here, but I'm one of the most skilled artist in my class, where people add only one layer of paint to each color for their assignment, have very faded looking drawings, and never stay in the lines, these are the people who are socially ""cool"", like they think that because they're in a group they own the class. It's incredibly rude, as they over talk the teacher, and snicker behind me as they focus in on me paying attention (probably because I have the best answers), never have any clue what to say or what they're doing. And somehow, I'm the outcast. Cause I won't join in on their silly little gossip club.

It's sort of like, I don't babble all the time with them and I end up getting more work done.  But because I'm not as social I'm seen as ""weird"". Honestly though, as much as I like creating art for people to see, I really don't enjoy hanging out with those people. I like to talk to them separately. But I feel as if they're almost too intimidated by my talent to consider working more on their own talent.  This is why I feel like the shaman at the edge of the village when I do my work: I'm alone, take the space I need, and I don't give a shit about how many people laugh at me behind my back. 

It's the old tale of the artist who's too pure for his own world. Make connections and immediately you're subjected to a certain kind of subculture. That's why I haven't marketed myself too much just yet: I'm looking for that perfect niche, maybe sell to rich people landscapes and act like a pretentious simpleton who has lots of money but no soul, or sell to people with less money, more soul and make my art my own thing and not a project for some rich snob.

My question to you all is, why does society shun brilliance? Why are most people so afraid of diving into an abyss with them to explore new worlds?",30,1853,1,355,1

UNIVERSE

we are in a universe that is a small piece of dust within an infinite number of universes that go on to infinity and eternity in both directions of going smaller to microscopic universes like particles or expanding to macroscopic universes that within each higher dimensional universe become more subtle and higher vibrational. These universes are more eternal and infinite the more you expand. at once all realities are real, all are illusionary, and some realities are true and other realities are illusionary, and at the same time all of the above are true- it is brahman, maya, duality, and nirvana tao. this is the fourinity of the universal cosmic consciousness.



if you can understand this there is no need to read anymore of this book and nothing i can ever say will teach you anything. This is because when the universe, tao, nirvana, brahman, and god is named it is merely a name and not the Eternal Universe, Tao, Brahman, Nirvana, and God. The finger pointing to the moon is not the moon.


THE LORD

I AM

These are the first two words thought by the Lord of the universe before and after the big bang of consciousness of all infinite dimensions and possibilities bursting forth in the mind of GOD after emerging from the void of the WORD WAY TAO. There the Lord realized everything that would happen for all eternity and went forth to set in motion 10,000 zillion kalpas of incarnations of different aspects of the one Eternal Self. The various incarnations flow in and out of absorption of God and experience different levels of heavens and hells, bliss and suffering, pleasure and pain, good and bad- the yin and yang polarized more and more the higher levels of consciousness you reach. And each deeper inner temple you reach the lions guarding the gates to the next inner temple get more and more ferocious the closer to God you get. However paradoxically the deeper you get the lighter, refined, and more subtle your internal reality gets. 


COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS

We are all humans on earth within our milky way galaxy with the star of our system. This is the sun which is the physical manifestation of God within our system. Advanced spiritual beings from a universe more evolved then our universe appear in this realm as the homeless, mentally ill, retarded, blind, sick, crippled, poor, starving deprived, gay, ordinary, monks, prophets, masters, and major manifestations of God like Krishna, Lao Tzu, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, and Mohammad. These beings are all here to guide and help assist in the process of evolving beings here to higher realms, higher states of consciousness, and higher vibrational frequencies. But ultimately we are all those beings and while we do have individual incarnations that follow a path cycling through the maya of samsara, our individual incarnations in the end all reach nirvana or complete union with God (moksha). 


INFINITE FRAGMENTED FRACTAL SELVES WITHIN A UNIVERSAL SELF THAT CONTAINS ALL SELVES

All our infinite selves flow through eternity on the crest of waves of moments which ride bigger waves of years, then bigger waves of lifetimes, which ride bigger waves of universes expanding to infinity and the Eternal Tathata. Gods of all levels manifest at different vibrational frequencies imparting their energies into the universe- Jesus is the human manifestation of Yahweh, Yahweh being Jesus' higher self. Moses' higher self is Jehova, Krishna's is Vishnu, Mohammad's is Allah, Buddha's is the Dharma, Lao Tzu's is the Tao, Osiris is Ra, and Quezacolta is Spirit. These are all manifestations of God's infinite consciousness who we must BECOME and absorb all the universal energies of all the beings of the universe. the order of universal selves if looked at through the filter of the relative world is as follows


BEINGS THAT HAVE ACHIEVED PERFECT GOD CONSCIOUSNESS IN HUMAN FORM

Krishna 6000 BC, Lao Tzu 5000 BC, Moses 3000 BC, Buddha 500 BC, Jesus 33 BC, Mohammad 500 AD, Osiris, Quezacolta, Prometheus.

2023-02-09 23:24:53,Psychedelic therapy is a bad idea,"Hot take maybe, but hear me out.

The relationship between patients and therapists is already power-imbalanced enough to pose real risks, and psychedelics are powerful drugs. People are suggestible, emotionally vulnerable, and easily abused in the psychedelic state.

In the ideal setting, with a well-meaning trip guide who's trained, held accountable, etc, it could be fantastic (and, based on current studies, is), but imagine the end result in 10-20 years when basically anyone can get licensed.

Today you may have to speak with 5-8 therapists before finding one who won't push their religion on you, or some other shit, and few people can afford to even meet that many or have that many on offer. Most therapists are worse than no therapist. How bad would it be if those abusive or incompetent therapists could inebriate you with LSD and _then_ push their religion on you (or whatever their particular corruption is)?

In my ideal future, psychedelics are 100% decriminalized, not even misdemeanor level. Legal to cultivate, use, and gift. But institutions, especially commercial institutions, have to keep their distance.

2021-08-23 19:59:07,The day I predicted my mom's death and ended up in a mental institution for 1 month on cubensis mushrooms 8g,"Okay guys, this is my first post here so please be nice :')

So I have taken dried mushrooms like a hundred times over the last few years and I was slowly increasing the dosage until it reaches 8g, my final objective, I've always used sitters to help me not go nuts and try to jump from my apartment during my trips or something, but I've actually never had any bad trips, I usually prepare myself weeks before taking it

In February this year (2021), I was ready to try 8g, my 2 friends who lived with me in my apartment were helping me on this trip, it started well with fractals and the sense of timeless bounds, but it ended up as the most terrible vision I've ever had... once it ended I pretended I was okay because my friends were going to travel the next day (at Sunday night), and once they left, I simply left my apartment at 23 pm without thinking where I was going, but at least I had my phone to use google maps to come back

I spent 24 hours away from my apartment, when I got back my mom and my friends were there and apparently they have been looking for me and even created posts with my face on Facebook... but anyways when we talked out what happened, they sent me into a mental health institution for a month

It turns out that on the trip I saw myself in my mother's belly, and then lots of images from my childhood, this last for what appears to be a very looong time, once the images stop, something weird happens, first I have a black-screen vision, then I have a cold feeling of a needle into my arm and when I open my eyes I realize that I'm in my mom's body and there is multiple machines keeping me alive, people come and talk to me but I'm unable to respond them, and then, everything goes black and I'm still at my mother's body and I'm in a kind of virtual scene from a garden, there is even a water fountain

After a while a man with blood dirty clothes comes in and walks in my direction, he started talking some poetry about life meaning and he looked at me and said: ""you are so hurt my child"". then he cries, then I cry, he looks at me in the eye and I'm back at my body, still in the garden,  he says ""I'm sorry, but you will just have to continue without her"".

The trip ended after a couple of minutes or hours, I'm not sure, but you see, this is a pretty crazy story, no one would ever believe me, I told them and they thought I was crazy and that's why I had to stay one month in that clinic, it was horrible, they gave me so many pills that I didn't even remember who I was for a moment, or what I was doing there, or when I would leave...

When it ended I got back home and the months have passed, I tried to forget that but it eventually haunted me at my dreams. Things are kind of normal, even though people look at me as if I'm crazy sometimes, but guess what?

Three weeks ago my mom got weak and had to be taken to the hospital, she spent a week on the ICU, no one would tell me or my family what she had. So after a week she was there the doctors called me and my mom's husband to see how she was, they told us that ""she had a brain infection and we tried getting her back but she was so weak that we weren't able to, the infection spread and now she is considered brain dead, the machines will keep her alive and breathing for as long as the heart is beating""

I asked if we could see her and when we enter her room, what I see is the exact same machines I saw on my trip keeping me alive and the tubes on my mouth and nose breathing for me, one day after this, her heart stopped beating...

This is a true story, I buried my mom last Saturday and still can't believe it",108,3620,21,724,1

I understand and regret not being a good trip sitter but you have to understand that I seriously was thinking my friend was brain dead, you should have seen him he was acting like a dementia patient and a serious retard, this man did not know if he had shat his pants, That wasn‚Äôt a joke I told him, he had a stain, we spent 30 minutes trying to get him to check if he had shit himself or not, I wasn‚Äôt purposely being a dick but if you see someone being such a mong you begin to worry",19,770,4,154,1

2014-02-16 18:22:57,"Wow, some people (meat-eaters) on Reddit are sociopaths.","I was browsing Reddit's archive and came upon this:

http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/dyplu/ysk_that_baby_calves_are_taken_from_their_mom_at/

As someone who wants american communities to move towards a diet with less meat consumption and the complete elimination of factory farming, this made me feel hopeless for us as a species for a blink of a second.

People in that thread went above and beyond their ego, with one redditor mentioning that even if the baby cows were drugged and skinned alive to taste better he wouldn't mind. The general consensus was that pain or ""tears"" makes them more delicious. Fucking sickening. And yet it seems ok to talk about baby cows taken away from their mothers on day 3 like that because they're not human, of course.

Yet if I mention that human toddlers are delicious and should be beaten and drugged before being eaten I am labeled a literal Hitler. Why? Who are we to decide that a baby cow is less important than a baby's life? I don't recall agreeing to that...in fact I would rather the baby cow lived as their relationship with the Earth is symbiotic and they give back to Mother Nature,  whilst the human baby is just one of 7 billion parasites who will leech off the Earth by most likely being born into a narrow-minded family and consuming precious resources.

I'm not against meat eating and I believe the deal with nature is we give an animal a happy life and protect it, then eat it.

But the sickening comments in that thread just lend credence to the fact that man is not symbiotic with nature anymore...we have lost touch and are paying the price dearly.

Many people in that thread seem to think that animals are being personified, and people are the best. Thus, you should love man and disregard other ""delicious"" sentient life and make more babies because we are ""humans"", after all. The problem with that is you are assuming that humans are not a giant disease - a viral infection that has spread globally around Earth.

The complete disregard and apathy for anything but human life is shocking to me.

I secretly hope that some massive catastrophe wipes us all out so we have to confront our true nature of existence. The people in that thread seem as though they have never had the pleasure of their ego being stripped away until they realize that they could have very well been that abused baby cow.

Probably a combination of moderate alcohol consumption to bring out their inner primitive ape ego, coupled with the fact that they are stressed out and working 60 hours a week.",56,2554,8,438,1

2016-07-25 19:27:13,Why you're insane and why psychedelics aren't the answer,"My memory of psychedelic terror reminds me that sanity is just a frame of mind, that there also exists burning hot places where people are laid on slabs of rock in the sun where they're sacrificed and killed in front of thousands of people, that there's a shaman down a tunnel wondering if he'll ever come out, that there's a boy whose village was massacred living out of the jungle on his own.
We all need to remind ourselves that one day we'll turn around and there will be the figure of death ready to freshen things up with his scythe. We all truly seek less, a clearing which only death can provide so that life can once again begin. The monkey seeks the demise of his sanity that he may die before his time and know something else. But it always seems to remain, coming back more and more twisted and ingrown. The bush gets more dense and the grass almost seems to be growing through his feet. So run for the life you sought to destroy! After all, you weren't really seeking death, to do such a thing is forbidden, you were only chancing to a further degree than you knew.

Things are forbidden to you because you aren't a yogi with any mastery over his energy, you aren't a daemon or a wizard. At best you're a wielder of base physical power at worst you are an animal-without-peace, a thing that can never settle or look over it's shoulder for fear of letting any of itself die. Things which are admired for their strength by a straight society, even in the amazon, are basic and uncreative, they serve the group and their desires. To go out and find truth is selfish, every seeker is an outcast, he wears the criminal's orange and shaves his head. His face doesn't mean the things that the shop keeper and the bankteller want to know, the seeker long ago rejected culture and made his own thing out of it. Without guidance in a safe direction, the seeker is liable to become a pervert of the highest degree in the eyes of society. To him, language and structure are just the shit that's left over after the creative process. To the society, the shit is holy and the seeker is death incarnate come to knock over their silos, burn the village and sever all bloodlines. Sometimes he just might humor them, just might put on that mask and get carried away with the fun of it.

A true seeker can only arise form a society built by a seeker and maintained by true seekers. Like ancient Hindu culture for example, where the ones running the show are the old men who live in caves and return with a million stories to tell all of which are perfectly honed like a stone going downstream. Most of these places either got it wrong or were invaded by the west. Even the ones who institutionalized it were wrong, the monasteries and shamanic practitioners only produce a specific story which the lay people can keep telling each other, it's always the same society that comes out of it, worker bees and queens.

The ideal society is easily ruined by a neighboring insane society and war is fought, the differences come to the surface and intelligence goes towards making pointy phallus's. The sane society is the one with no fear, obviously western culture is the biggest fear based society ever conceived. All the near-sane or sane societies have welcomed insanity to an extent. Some push it to the ends of life and tolerate crazy old people, others tolerate it through organised religion and let it grow on it's own in an ashram in peace, others, like ours are organised for and by the insane people so the insane go directly to positions of power. Everybody is nuts so in order to keep the system together it uses extreme concise methods, just to save itself another day. It invents psychology, a place where the rails end and the cart flies in to a heap. The people are lobotomized from their own insanity after the suppression from birth wasn't enough or are told a quaint story about their past, putting it into some imaginary perspective. After hearing too many revving engines, too many news stories, too many screams of anguish masked by polite conversation, a person is sedated and rendered a heap of useful flesh, after which he is poured into the machine, destroyed in his identity, and excreted back into the soil. Before the insanity comes the indoctrination, the flashing lights and the eyes that say 'you are nothing'. During the insanity is the part we all find ourselves. After it is realized that the mighty all seeing eye can only see in one place at once, it is quickly deduced that a person can do and think whatever he wants as long as he survives. Eventually this kind of person is split into so many slathering gorillas and wounded horses that he seems to be living 30 parallel lives and doesn't even know what he's looking at any more. In an attempt to make all one, the society must expand, all soundwaves are replaced with those of the circus. All that must remain is this madman running in the night with tears at his cheeks, all peace must succumb to a schizophrenic alcohol restrained rampage of destruction. The beast builds itself and restrains itself using the method of quantity over quality or else remains a slave to everyone else. Either in his search for weakness or for power he remains insane, never having been blessed with a sane mind from the moment of birth. From the moment he was categorized and introduced to the noise of cars and TV he was already gone.

The reason a tripped out rant reads like a lottery ball dispenser is because psychs put you in a state where a new narrative pushes itself through the old rubble with a certain intensity. Your whole schizophrenic brain was fine chugging along with the occasional beer and episode of 'Friends' until everything got activated at once. From then on, after a dose, everything you see is picked up and absorbed and given profound meaning. So you hear the circus of mass media or even a busy highway and compare it to your biological memory of a harmonious jungle and you activate the part of you that panics and thinks it can fight. To regain your inheritance, your birthright of a peaceful mind, you think that mania is the answer simply because you have short-circuited. You think you can find the answer amidst your memories or anything outside of yourself. The worst thing is the fact that your mind is set up to become confused when supercharged because it has so many unexplored pathways and so much trash. The very sun can become a source of insanity when looked at through the perspective of looking at a TV, the idea of seeing the sun in such a small perspective drives one to wide eyed rocking on the spot. The moment when reality becomes a meaningless TV show just out of confusion, when you mix up divine reality with a post office, when a paradigm like listening to digital speakers is seen for it's pain and discomfort compared to listening to a real musician and then it is thought that a musician sounds like these speakers. That moment, when you know how trapped you are, you crave quick release and return to fetal position in your mind's eye. The roller coaster was witnessed from beginning to end, or enough to get a warped picture, and nothing can return the illusion of comfort but a long sleep and a lot of forgetting. 

Truly, I would not recommend psychedelics for 99% of people under 99% of situations. When mixed with the kind of imagery we have floating around, the kind of focused perspectives and thought loops we have lurking around, there is bound to be something you can't avoid and which is masked in several layers of illusion. You stop at any one perspective on the surface, you see a false reality, you get to your core perspective, your closest held beliefs, and you are simply not in a state of health to touch these things without smashing them. Fed on beans on toast and western media, you think you can handle the Amazon jungle coursing through your veins and carry on unimpaired. No, you will stumble and fall and weep. Yoga allows focus on one thing out of hundreds so the yogi can see it's rotation over a period of years, you think in 8 hours you're gonna do what that Yogi can do with years of effort? I know you're going to do it anyway and find yourself like most of the sadsacks in the sub, begging and pleading strangers for the answer to THEIR questions. You're gonna start asking questions without any basis for asking them, the way you ask the question reveals no intention to find the answer for that question. Posting on the internet 'What is reality?' when you can't even access the part of your brain which sits your body still and at peace. Your foolishness will gain only an ego by using psychedelics.",56,8656,9,1562,1

It appears to have been expressly engineered to switch people off to the wider implications, and the wider mystery of being alive. It bombards our consciousness with sterile, souless messages of production and consumption, of envy and greed, that never get to the fundamentals of everything.",33,365,5,58,1

2015-05-24 15:48:08,Not everyone is a psychonaut,"Well, I'd guess I'd rather say not everyone is tapping into the psychonautic capabilities. I have to remember I cannot ""force"" people to reflect on their own lives or spirituality or on the human existence, but I sure do want them to, especially when I'm on LSD. Yesterday I did LSD for the fifth time, and it was my friend's first time. We watched Futurama on the come-up and The Boondocks on the comedown (that show holds it down HARD, if you've never watched it its definitely our kind of thing). 

Overall it was a great trip, I got to share one of my favorite experiences with my best friend for the first time, and that's awesome. The only issue is that the whole trip felt like go, go,go, and there are definitely times during an acid trip where you should slow down and talk, have a dialogue with the people around you about what's in your head, because that's part of how you learn from LSD, in my opinion. 

Not that my friend and I were running around the city or out with other people the whole time, but more like that the slower times still felt fast because I didn't have a chance to examine my feelings and thoughts deeply enough. 

After my friend left, I was still tripping probably at like a 4.5/10, and it was dark, and I was the only tripping person out of the people I was with (boyfriend, roommate, other friend) and I just talked to them about life and what I had learned from the day, and I am sure  I'll learn that I learned more from that trip as time goes on. but I just wanted to share some thoughts with you, that kind of surprised me, because I figured most people take LSD and have intense times of introspection but I guess some people turn away from that side and use it as a sort of ""party drug"" (which is fine by me, just not my thing). 

Perhaps this friend will have profundities that they can take from the trip, and I really hope so, because I want everyone to feel deeply about the universe and themselves, but if not, that is a learning experience as well. If you would like a full trip report I will gladly type one up as well.",28,2070,5,393,1

I've been pondering it myself for months now, but after no real improvement it's starting to look like I'm going to actually find out about this thing. Basically, I'm a 16 year old living in melbourne, and last year I got into a few things that I now passionately regret. Namely, LSD. This isn't to say I didn't have a lot of fun with it, I did, but it wasn't even close to being worth what it cost me. After my 10th and last time, on the 8th of December 2013, I lost something. Something that I am yet to recover, and am now, unsure I ever will. I lost the ability to picture things in my mind, my short term memory has been significantly lessened, and I feel like a layer of thought that I once had, and, took for granted, has now been washed away. It's hard to explain, but hopefully through discussion I can bring more clarity to you guys, and perhaps can get some myself. I no longer touch drugs and it is fair to say this has been a very sobering lesson, but this is irrelevant, I'm not here to discuss drug use and the rationality behind it, I couldn't give less of a shit about your support/vitriol for it, I've made my mistakes, formed my opinions, and now am only interested in the reparation of my mind. I honestly just want to my wholeness back. There were dark times, when I felt like there was no point in living if I was going to be doing it as a lesser reflection of what I once was, but I've since resolved that hope and perseverance are the only way to go, I refuse to cheat myself out of a fulfilling life because I want to sit around and bitch about my mistakes. However, with that in mind, it would be nice if there was any hope at all for me, and if there is, I intend on finding it.

&#x200B;

We are researchers at The Ohio State University and Johns Hopkins conducting an interesting internet-based survey research study about psychedelics (e.g., MDMA, Mescaline/Peyote/San Pedro, LSD, Psilocybin, 5-MeO-DMT) among gender and sexual minority adults. This study will permit a better understanding about the study of altered states of consciousness, interpretation, and immediate and long-term effects of psychedelics among this understudied group. Our hope is that, ultimately, we will receive thousands of responses to the survey so that we can better understand gender and sexual minorities‚Äô experiences after taking psychedelics, resulting in better clinical protocols and treatment options in the future.

&#x200B;

If you are interested in participating or would like to know more about the study, please click the link below to the secure study site. We anticipate that it will take you approximately 45-60 minutes to complete the survey. Upon completing the survey, you will have the option to be entered into a raffle for one of 15 $100 gift cards, 300 $20 gift cards, or 600 $10 gift cards.

2019-12-27 03:19:23,"Because you think you are an individual, true love is not present.","It is only because you think you are an individual that you have problems, insecurities, anxiety, fears, judgement etc.

You think there is ""you"" a separate from the whole, and therefore you see others as separate as well, you do not allow your self to be your self, you do not allow your self to be vulnerable, you seek acceptance and you seek for people to not hate you, you want people to love you although you do not even love your self.  
All problems in life stem from this illusion of individuality.   
Did you ever thoughts that your bad thoughts are ALL personal? All your beliefs are PERSONAL? All your ideas, concepts, identity, imagination, everything is PERSONAL.

Your whole existence you believe your self to be personal. Something irrelevant happens and you say ""this always happens to **me**"" or ""Why do they always treat **me** like this?"" or ""**I** always have these thoughts, I hate God!""

Every single thing you believe to somehow relate to you. Because you believe you are individual, you are extremely selfish. You try to take care of your self all the time, fearing life and others, because you can't accept your own self as the universe. You were conditioned to believe you are an individual which needs to have certain things, that you are thinking in this way, that you must have certain beliefs, that you must know some concepts and ideas in order to operate in the world. The truth is, you were taught these things by people who literally have no idea who they are and what they are doing in the universe.

You were taught and raised by people who **think** they are individuals. Obviously you were born as a whole, you were life, but you were conditioned to believe you are individual. You got an individual name, everyone in society treated you as individual, and you simply started believing you are individual. That is not true. Even now, you are life it self. You are the universe it self experiencing the universe. There is no individual identity, it is a lie, an illusion. It is all an idea made up by your head. It has nothing to do with reality. It is all one big thought construct, that you believed your self to be. Well, it is not true.

There is this identity which you currently believe your self to be.

There is an awareness of this identity that you believe your self to be, otherwise you wouldn't be able to say ""I am this person"", you would not be aware of your identity.

So there is an awareness of the identity, but even of this awareness you are aware, otherwise you wouldn't be able to say ""Yes, that is correct, this is the identity I believe my self to be, and I am aware of that"".

So, not only are you aware of the identity, you are aware of the awareness it self.   
When you realize this, recognize this in your direct experience (You can try it right now) you will realize that you never were in the first place. It was just an idea in your head. It never had any reality, you just believed it to be true. 

You are the witness of the awareness it self. Close your eyes, you see a black screen.

That black screen is awareness with no light, and you are not that awareness. You are the perceiver of even that awareness. You are the witness of the awareness it self. The truth is you have nothing to do with this world. You, the true you, was never born, you can never die in fact because you never were born. Because of this, you can't suffer either, because only an identity can suffer. Only who you think you are can suffer, but you are not that, as you are aware even of the awareness of that identity, the identity can't possibly be you. That is seen easily.

Once you realize this, recognize this in your direct experience, you will be able to see through all thoughts, all beliefs, all illusions and say ""This is not me"" because ANYTHING you perceive, can't be you, the perceiver. That is the truth and even a child can understand this. Nothing to think, nothing to imagine, nothing to conceptualize, nothing to complicate, it is a simple direct experience TRUTH and KNOWING. 

Being aware of being aware is enlightenment. Currently you are aware of the identity, but you never questioned your self what you truly are, you never asked the question ""Who am I"" and searched, you always perceived a thought by the mind and immediately believed it without questioning it. Because of that you never were able to be aware of being aware.   
Being aware of being aware is the ultimate reality of this existence. It is enlightenment. It is waking up from the dream. If you were to stay aware of being aware, naturally, automatically everything that is not you would slowly disappear into nothingness, until nothing is left except you, the witness of the awareness, the only truth. Everything else is a thought, belief, concept, emotion, sensation, all coming and going phenomena, anything that comes and goes can't possibly be you, as you are the one aware of these things coming and going. You can't be one of the coming and going phenomena. You are beyond change, you are the unchanging witness of life it self. You are life it self experiencing life. There is only life. ""other"" people only **think** they are individual, because they were conditioned to believe that. But it simply is false, you can EASILY see this.

Most are too attached to the ego and are slaves to the ego, that is why you see everything that is wrong with the world. They think they are separate and therefore they go and hurt others, not understanding that others are in fact them selves, as there are no others, only the one true self, which is life. 

If all people were aware of being aware, we would all be treating others kindly, compassionately, lovingly, peacefully and joyfully, as the only truth is that we are all one, and we do not hurt ourselves. It is only when the mind comes and thinks ""I am a separate individual"" that all the bullshit appears to exist. It is not true. It is only a thought. You mustn't believe it. Overcome this stupid mind that keeps you from being your true self. You are beyond the mind. 

The mind can't exist without you, consciousness, life, but you, life, can exist without the mind. Realize what you are, recognize it for your self and be your self.

You can't change the world but the only thing you can change is your self. You can be aware of being aware, and just that will completely change the world, as the presence of one aware presence is stronger and more influential on the whole universe than a thousand unconscious beings which are caught up and are being slaved by the ego, believing they have no power, believing they are depressed, anxious, judgemental, greedy, and believe that others are others instead of treating everyone as they would treat themselves.",66,6750,12,1211,1

2019-08-07 02:41:35,Psychodelics to treat mental health issues is BS!,"I'm a 41(m) that has a successful sales career that provides a comfortable living earning over 6 figures a year but I have struggled with mental health issues now and then. Spouts of depression and anxiety have been challenges I've had my entire life. I've struggled to maintain a relationship and wanted to change. As an avid listener to Joe Rogan, I was exposed to psychedelics as a potential option.

I started therapy at the same time I decided to start micro dosing. I did this with both LSD and mushrooms for about a year. I noticed very little changes. I was still optimistic about how psychedelics might be able to help me so I booked a trip to the Amazon where I did 7 sessions of Ayahuasca. These were interesting trips but nothing profound happened. I felt more relaxed for a bit but a couple months after I returned I fell into a deep depression that I felt suicidal idealization. I've struggled with changed. All I know is that I'm not happy. I'm lonelier then I have ever been. I struggle doing my work and it will eventually catch up with me and I'll lose my job. I continue to see a therapist who knows everything I'm doing. I also see a psychiatrist who wanted to put me on meds but at this point I have not. I even joined group therapy. I'm a bright, educated and intelligent person. That people would desribe as an extrovert. When I go to group I feel above these people even though I know I'm having trouble regulating my emotions. 

Despite feeling all this I still thought psychedelics may have a benefit. I thought maybe I didn't go deep enough during my ayahuasca experiences. I tried a heroic dose of mushrooms and also extracted DMT and smoked it a few times; tried MDMA and now more than ever I'm confused. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I frequently have anxiety. I get caught up in mental loops that I don't know how to stop. 

I'm still optimistic about how psychedelics can assist me in change but holy shit this has been difficult. I realize they won't just do the work and that to change I will ultimately have to do the work. These aren't just magic. It's been a rough year. 

I picture everyone on reddit writting about their experiences I've read over the last year as tree hugging college kids, people who have trouble holding a job, dead beats, or someone other than me.

2018-12-25 01:09:55,My Opinion of Continued Psychedelic Use. They are the Human Equivalent of Dog Treats.,"***Disclaimer: this is just my opinion.***

&#x200B;

***I view psychedelics in the same light that I view dog treats. When a dog becomes dissatisfied or agitated by something it will whine and complain. To calm the dog down the owner(s) will give the dog a treat to calm him down. The dog experiences temporary joy and goes about its day. However, the dog never realizes that it never got what it actually wanted. Shrooms, LSD, weed, etc. are the dog treats in this scenario. I can't speak for everyone, but I know a good amount of people started and/or continue doing psychedelics because they are in search of some form of truth. Just like the dog, they indulge in the treat, but they never get what they started off wanting, but because the treat is better than nothing, they become satisfied with it. Never realizing that in the end they will never get what they want and the treat will always be the best thing.***

***\*Put your tin foil hats on\****

&#x200B;

***There is an alien influence that most people refuse to acknowledge due to mass brainwashing and fear of going against the status quo. Our masters know we have cosmic origins and long to have that experience again. They give us the 'psychedelics' and then design the worlds we go to when we take them. We are like the kids who think they are playing a game with you, but in actuality, the controller they are using isn't plugged in, but it makes them happy because they THINK they are accomplishing something.***

&#x200B;

***Dog: Whines***

***Owners: Give him treat***

***Dog: Ignorantly goes about its day without getting what it actually wanted.***

***------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***

***Humans: Seeks truth***

***Owners: Gives us shrooms, weed, DMT, etc.***

***Humans: Ignorantly goes about its day without getting what it actually wanted. ......***

***Psychs give you no answers, they only leave you with more questions. The goal is to remove all the junk and confusion out of your mind, not add more junk to it.

Also, the case of devani/samantha osteras in arizona looks to be of the same variety.

I am never visiting your tanster site, ever.

A wise man has said, 'be careful if you look to see angels, because if once you can see angels, you'll be able to see demons too.'

I add to this, 'the most difficult thing in the world is being able to verify the true identity of another being.'

I have had best friends and girlfriends who were agents of the state, deep fbi agents that went on road trips and meditation retreats with me. It took me a long time, years, to notice that they weren't who they said they were.

Now you are going to have some kind of seance or trip and then meditate with some voice you hear, and you are going to be able to tell what they are? yeah right.

I have some experience with this and the most I will say here is that the tesla stuff about 'understanding the universe in terms of frequency, light and vibration' is the best advice you will get.

paul simon also chimes in, 'you can't walk with the holy if you're just a halfway decent man'

another insight i just picked up on the internet from some jedi religion website, 'most people think they act in the grey-white moral range, but they actually act in the grey-black moral range.' which is to say, you are probably not as good of a person as you think you are.

so now you take whatever pills/substance and get into some deep trance meditative state where you are open to spiritual things and you think you are just going to dial up the number of the good guys automatically?

that's now how any of this works.

test everything. absolutely trust nothing except your family, if they have proven themselves worthy of it. you have to know someone ten years to really know what they are about. you have to be homeless and see if they will let you stay with them, you have to live with them as a poor person to see if they will treat you like a slave, for example.

everyone and everything will want to be your friend when you have money and can take them on fun trips, when you have stories to tell of important industry. even(especially) really bad people/things.

i knock on wood when i say something really confident. I would never play with a ouja board, i don't think it is possible to play with one.

get sam harris and richard dawkins to play with a ouja board, we'll see how long they last.

don't play with fire, don't play with guns, don't play with entities.

make alliances slowly, but if something reveals itself to not be on your side, break it off immediately and no need for explanations.

satanism or anything along the lines of 'do whatever you want just don't hurt anybody' is going to be the demons though.

and what the demons want the most, in my opinion, is that you ruin lives and make people miserable. The most efficient way to do this is to harm children.

so if you want to find the cults worshiping demons and controlled by them, all you have to do is find the child abusers and child traffickers.

All of these people will think they are talking with angels and they are worshiping some deity that will care for them, when they are just slaves in their mansions who are in hook line and sinker.

in my opinion, this is the nature of the struggle on earth in our time. If you dive into this stuff without a firm understanding, you are basically food for the bad guys.

This is the result of every country on earth banning pyschedelic practices and shamanism, like a country that bans spelunking or mountain climbing and is beset by people getting lost in caves and mountain ranges.

2022-12-24 04:49:15,Bothered by the mainstream recreational culture of psychedelics,"As I‚Äôve tried psychedelics, and how they‚Äôre becoming more and more accepted in popular society, I can‚Äôt help but become annoyed as to how it seems the majority of people who partake are swept up in the more ‚Äúrecreational‚Äù usage of them. I‚Äôm not necessarily saying that there is a right way for people to use psychedelics, but I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of people who are missing the point to the use, at least from how I have experienced them. 

It‚Äôs been said that, even between general effects, everyone will have a different experience tripping. But it‚Äôs as if the majority of people are caught up in a lot of the unsubstantial aspects of these drugs. When I tripped, it‚Äôs always been with a good friend who is more experienced, but also contrasts my energy by being ADHD-level interested in every technical thing, which imprints onto me. 

Combined with the attempt to apply things that I learned to areas of my life while having fun tripping, the aspects that people most commonly associate and/or appreciate about psychedelics, like the visuals, hallucinations, and blissful emotions become practically nothing compared to the novel thought processes and epiphanies. These in turn can become great life-changing behaviors. 

With LSD and mushrooms, I‚Äôve taken common doses, and while strong, I‚Äôve never felt swept up from reality, unable to conduct and interact with others. At worst I‚Äôve gotten sick (uneasy trip), and at best, rigid plans for a trip just fall by the wayside, but not in an out-of-touch way.

I don‚Äôt know. It just irks me that (seemingly) a lot of people who get into psychedelics don‚Äôt see it as something to be taken as a more ‚Äúnoble‚Äù experience. Instead, they‚Äôll go and plaster a bunch of swirly hippie posters and tapestries around, listen to typical psychedelia music, and oogle at surface-level sensations, but to each their own I guess.

 I mean my post may have given the wrong impression. We're very well prepared for a good trip. We're all very close friends and known each other for years. We're going to paint the walls. There'll be grass, trees, cats and a dog. We've made a shared playlist for the meeting too.

Like I don't intend to have a bad trip and I do think everything will be ok.

But what if some of the 7 people have a bad trip? Bad trip are like fungus on a bread slice. If one has it the others are probably going to have it too. So if one of us have a bad trip. This person should have the option to end the trip. Even more so as they will probably affect others. Maybe you should hide a bad trip out when you're solo. But not when you're group tripping.

So please. If you answer me my question about if it works. Not with ""you should never do it and I never done it"" (then how can you even be helpful?) 


I'll appreciate a lot the help‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 


So. This weekend is the birthday of 2 good friends of my! They are twins.
I've used 2mg of Rivotril before. I've taken LSD, MDMA, weed and others before.

But I do take drugs very rarely.

I'm not anxious at all. I'm just preparing for a good trip. I'm not in the mindset that it WILL be bad. I'm just cautious cause I don't want me or my friends to be overwhelmed or worse make the others have a bad trip.

Some of us have depression and anxiety. But we're all good friends
   We decided to buy some LSD because it's their birthday.

   Our other friend's plug have an allegedly 400ug LSD. That's a hell lot of LSD. Although I think it may very well not be that strong/not be LSD at all because that's justs how it works when you can't test the tabs (testing the tabs isn't an option unfortunately because we're all poor)

   But assuming it really is 400ug of pure LSD. Will I be able to end the trip with Rivotril/Clonazepam? If so how much will I need for that? 

  I have 10 Rivotril pills (out of the pharmacy so they're legit) each of them dosed at 2mg (I know the 2mg would be over kill I don't intend in doing the whole pill). How much do I need to end the trip? Something like 1mg? At 400ug is it even possible to end the trip?

   Another question. I'm gonna dissolve the Clonazepam in water and divede it in very small doses (around 0,10 to 0,20mg). My goal with this is. If the trip is too much to handle but I don't want to completely end it, I will take the small Clonazepam dose in order to slightly attenuate the trip. Does anyone have any PERSONAL EXPERIENCE on that?

   (English is my second language so that's why I probably misspelled something or said something in a weird order or with not so correct words)

2020-06-16 20:15:41,Controversial and Unpopular Opinion: Opiate addicts are pussies,"Thumbs me down into oblivion for being arrogant or ‚Äúnot understanding addiction‚Äù but i think that junkies are the polar opposite of psychonauts. Could a dose of LSD convince heroin addicts that theyre just being egotistical and self loathing cry babies? Yes it can. So lets shut down methadone clinics and open up psychedelic therapy sessions.

Every addict I know has a million excuses for themselves in their ‚Äúhell‚Äù of addiction. Meanwhile other drug users who understand harm reduction understand that its not that drugs are inherently evil its just that you dont know how to accept yourself and need to find a crutch that will coddle you like a widdle baby.

Almost every heroin addict is hiding from the fact that they are alive. Then they complain all day about it and expect you to feel sorry for their own decision to get into a heavy drug that their weak mind couldnt handle. They are essentially afraid of and dont trust themselves. Id say most drugs teach you how to better yourself or at least be chill as a person, but heroin turns everyone into a dependent little bitch. I know so many people who get addicted to opiates and the one thing they all have in common is they use drugs almost like an excuse to cry about how hard their life is. Everyone single one has a story of when their heart broke or they were so desperate to just ‚Äúfeel good again‚Äù. AKA woe is me. We would all honestly be better off if we could shove acid down their throats so that they can see what hopeless pricks they are for stealing money and destroying family units with their way of life.

Heroin addiction deeply affects people around me and I have no sympathy. They do not understand safe drug use at all, they all cry all day. they pretty much do it as self harm because everyone knows its bad for you and you will get sympathy for being an addict.

I got my brother who was an addict for a little under a decade to quit fent just by sneaking him some acid and a little book on meditation while in rehab for the 57477378558657th time. Because he was such a prick, i didnt think he could handle it. I just sorta said one day ‚ÄúThis guys wants a drug ill give him a real drug to shut him up and give him some actual thought process for once and not opiates for the millionth time‚Äù It was in that one time where he tried to quit and something in his head just clicked. Really.

You know why? Because psychedelic drugs slap a bitch on its ass and turns them into soldiers. When you get into acid you either learn to accept yourself or get a bad trip. Opiates must do the opposite. I dont have experience but i bet that opiates don‚Äôt actually help you experience the dissociation needed to think of your own life choices critically. And because of that its all feel good with no lessons.

All in all. I think opiates are totally fine. When I see ex addicts vouch for making them illegal to prescribe all I can think is ‚Äúhey, some of us have actual problems and are NOT using the drug for ‚Äúproblems‚Äù like your dad not loving you‚Äù

I swear to God you could burn down my house and kill my dog and I will not turn to heroin. I will have a smile on my face by tomorrow.",63,3152,8,594,1

2013-02-26 21:32:03,HAE had sex with a spirit from another parallel universe?,"I had this incredible experience and wanted to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience?

I understand the world as many parallel universes existing together and sometimes these universes collide and experience a different type of reality.

I had been stoned and had this incredible clarity in my mind when I felt an incredible rush to my genitals. I experienced an incredible sensation of something getting my penis hard. My mind then filled with incredible fantasies. I experienced feelings of intercourse with a spirit. This entity embodied my every fantasy but would change image moments before intense sexual arousal, as if I were to gaze any longer my mind couldn't handle it. I experienced the smells and the sensory feelings of touch all over my body at once.

The sensation was so intense that at the moment of climax I could feel my seed travel through to another dimension.

Now, I know this sounds strange, but normally trips on marijuana does not cause me to hallucinate this hard. Perhaps the drugs allowed my mind to reach a higher consciousness to bridge the gap between our world and another and experienced this connection through empiricism, or a sensory experience?

2017-03-02 21:50:05,Does Anyone else Think That Terrence McKenna is kind of full of shit?,"**Edit:** I reread my post and realized it was more divisive than I wanted it to be and missed a lot of my points. I made some edits to clarify my perspective.

I used to love Terrence McKenna in early college. I would listen to all of his lectures and consider all of his philosophical assertions. To this day, I love his lecture on Culture is Your Operating System.

But as I got older I started to realize that finding universal truths within yourself, provides you with bias and not truth. To find truth, you must gather evidence and study the universe with the scientific method, as a way to pursue truth without bias. Drugs allow you to learn about yourself, your philosophies, and other people. They do not give you some ancient, ultimate truth. (specifically, I mean factually backed truth and not personal truth. I wanted to clarify) I started realizing people would jump to conclusions and utilize cognitive bias and magical thinking to generate their world views. Someone suggesting they DISCOVERED that the all of our consciousness is part of a single superconscious  and that this world is merely a manifestation of that is no different than a christian suggesting that the Universe is a God that has created us. 

I started listening to McKenna's old lectures and I was disappointed to realize how little he understood about science (Edit: To specify an example, he mentions that the Big Bang asserts that science suggests that everything came from nothing. This is a misinterpretation of what we currently understand about the given information)  and how much he jumps to conclusions and asserts things with no real evidence (another edit: I want to clarify that not ALL of his assersions are baseless. He clearly knows a great deal about shamanistic ritual and historical context. This thread is specifically about personal assertions he makes about the universe). He disregards the scientific method and some of the things he says is downright cult-like (in the sense that he describes things with almost religious iconography with absence of evidence. Not that he is indeed some sort of manipulator). ~~A lot of the shit he says is total bullshit,~~ Some of the things he asserts does not have evidence, which can be determined by simple fact checking. I love his personal philosophies, but I hate his beliefs about how the universe works (not because I think they are impossible, but because they are often unfounded beyond personal experience and interpretation). He talks about science as if it's a political point of view with static stances based in conjecture, when all science is is the pragmatic unbiased study of the universe, based in what we can observe. 

To summarize. I think his general philosophies and perspectives are fascinating, but I think he makes assertions that are merely conjecture and he often favors his own personal views, over scientific discovery and factual information. I find it a hard pill to swallow that you can gain knowledge about factual truth of the universe through personal self discovery and personal insight. I think there is a clear distinction between self discovery and practical examination of information.

2022-02-11 19:46:23,From 3D to 7D,"You the 3D human exist in a multiverse. There are many 3D realities in existence. This is because time is a 4D construct that maintains the existence of all the 3D realities. It stitches together 3D moments to grant the illusion of anything but the moment.

You choose which moments you find yourself in based on what you choose to perceive. These moments I speak of are all 3D realities. There are realities where it‚Äôs constantly night and it‚Äôs a spectrum, you‚Äôve got people sleeping peacefully at night, realities where people are making love, realities where people are commuting to work, realities where people are having nightmares,realities of people at work,  realities where people get into accidents, realities where people are having lustful sex, and realities where people are having horrible things done to them under the cover of night. Slow decent from heaven to hell.

There are 3D realities where it‚Äôs always day time, and it‚Äôs a spectrum as well. Realities where people are having fun spending time with family, realities where people are going to work, realities where people are at work, realities where accidents occur, and realities where people commit unspeakable acts in broad daylight. A slow decent into hell yet again.

4D time stitches together all these moments to grant the illusion of anything but the moment. If you find yourself fucked at the end of time, it is because the universe deemed it so and left you in a 3D torture chamber. If you do well you find yourself in a heaven where you can do whatever you want for all eternity.

But why get stuck on 4D when we can ascend? The 5th dimension is the dimension of concepts and these concepts are all rulers of their own 3D realities. You give yourself to a 5D religion, just know it is a mere fragment of the 6D conglomeration of religion. Same with 6D politics and it‚Äôs many 5D fragments. You the 3D human belong to a 5D concept of yourself. You owe nothing to anyone but yourself, your morals guide you. You are your own god. 

The reason why hell is eternal is because the dark 5D concepts were cut off from anything above 3D, they belong to darkness and so they have no power above 3D. They get their moments, they can rule forever, they don‚Äôt have the luxury of time and multiple moments stitching together like you still do. It‚Äôs never too late till the last minute.

Treat everyone as you would like to be treated and they will treat you in kind. Any bad actors can be changed if you turn the cheek. You won‚Äôt find yourself in bad realities unless you have a lesson you need to learn. 4D time ain‚Äôt a prison, it‚Äôs a school. Since it is never too late until the last moment every human has the chance to learn the truth and change for the better.

Truly believe someone has changed and they could. If you doubt they could change, even a little, it acts as a weed. Think of positive thoughts as seeds. They need to be watered and nurtured to grow. But negative thoughts, they are weeds, and they need to be dealt with at the source. You‚Äôve got to rip them from their roots. That darkness could grow subconsciously, that is to say, behind your back until it manifests itself full force for you to experience. You granted the thoughts so much power they affected your reality.

The reason thoughts affect your reality is because thoughts are just signals being sent to the brain. Reality, it‚Äôs just signals being sent to the brain. The things you touch send signals to the brain via the nerves in your hands. The things you smell send signals to the brain via the receptors in your nostrils. Your brain gets the signal from your heart to pump and from your lungs to breath, and you don‚Äôt even have to think about that. The taste buds in your tongue, your eyes, do I have to go on?

This is why it is important to pick and choose your 5D concepts wisely. The concepts of the 5th dimension interact with humanity via consciousness by implanting thoughts. Even now they could tell you I‚Äôm delusional. They may even tell you to tell me to seek help, out of the goodness of your heart of course. Or maybe they want you to be vitriolic and you‚Äôre just giving them so much power that you go through with it. I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt care. I choose to believe this will reach those who it‚Äôs meant to. And I know it will attract skeptics, but that is fine, I choose to believe my seeds are stronger than the enemies weeds.

When you read the words I type, think of the words as a 2D vessel for what I am trying to convey to you via my 5D consciousness. Think of your thoughts as 5D consciousness as well. Now, I ask you the consciousness, to take what I have to say and really give it thought. If it is never too late till the last moment and you are experiencing this reality through a 3D vessel, does that not mean you have the chance to be saved? Give up your dark ways and grow. Heal.

But you don‚Äôt have to, if you truly desire that darkness you can have it. It‚Äôs free for you to take. You know what you are, but you also know that there should be a chance for you as well. There is a chance, and I‚Äôm attempting to give it to you.

I know there are heavily deeply seeded dark concepts like anger and depression, lust and many more. But you the human are everything you could possibly perceive. You could choose to perceive those dark thoughts, or you could choose to perceive better thoughts. If you are cognizant of your existence, then don‚Äôt think of it as losing yourself if you give into the positive thoughts. Think of it as accepting help from your brothers and sisters in 5D.

Again, you‚Äôre totally free to choose your darkness. I‚Äôm no judge, I accept you for what you are and thank you for your role in this reality. You are bringing all the humans who resonate with you and the thoughts you implant down with you. But you as the concept can choose to accept the help of your fellow concepts and change for the good.

Death is a 5D concept that is responsible for stopping individuals from resonating with realities they are no longer compatible with. If you were truly lost, you would be dead to this reality. Now, as a 5D entity that loses access to everything above 3D, this means you can‚Äôt die, nobody in your reality can die, it‚Äôs just a shit show. But you‚Äôre here, you can still die. That means you still have a chance to change for the good.

You don‚Äôt have to choose darkness and resonate into those dark realities as the 3D vessel. Those 5D concepts will always exist, but you are here now and you get to pick and choose the concepts you wish to work with. The reason I brought death up is because a few of you were asking that of me, ‚Äúwhat if my brethren kill me?‚Äù You are safe here in the light. Die to those dark 3D realities while you still have the chance via the 4D construct of time. Live on in the light.

That is not to say kill yourself, that would give you to the 5D concept of suicide. You don‚Äôt want to find yourself in a 3D reality where everyone tries to kill themselves and keep failing, that‚Äôs what I like to call a hell. A 3D hell dictated by the 5D concept of suicide. You want to die of something not of your own accord, like natural or getting killed without your consent. That is the universe doing it‚Äôs thing. Even if you‚Äôre killed by someone of darkness, all that happens is they‚Äôre doing the lords work and freeing you from the dark realities. You can‚Äôt sell your soul unless you‚Äôve chosen to believe you‚Äôve sold it.

The reason you can‚Äôt sell your soul is because Jesus Christ already bought it man. Jesus Christ is a 5D concept not to be confused with the 5D concept of Christianity. He fragmented down via 4D time into every 3D reality conceivable. He made a deal with the 5D concept of death to sacrifice himself in every single reality to purchase all of our souls. Since he made a deal with 5D death he was able to come back into 3D reality showing he is above the 5D concept of death.

Since time is a 4D construct that stitches together 3D moments this shows Jesus Christ is above time. The trick with dying and finding yourself in hell is that you lose access to 4D time and find yourself in a 3D reality. But so long as you remain in time, you find yourself sharing reality with everyone. You are a 3D human now, but you belong to a concept. You get to pick and choose your concepts. You can choose to believe you belong to any concept. You can choose to believe you are any concept.

If you are a manifestation of those dark concepts, think of this as your chance to change if you so desire. Do it, change. You are everything before you are you after all. So say for example you are the ultimate darkness. All you have to do is change your thought patterns. Choose to accept the thoughts that serve you and deny the thoughts attempting to keep you tethered to a lower vibrational reality. Thoughts are all foreign after all.

Now if you believe you are the human and are open to it, you belong to a 5D concept of you as a whole. You chose to fragment down here to help humanity, to experience, to express your true authentic self. If that expression is darkness then have it. But if you feel light deep within, embrace it. You don‚Äôt have to, someone else will choose it eventually. You‚Äôre just a 3D fragment after all, there are other 3D fragments of you in every possible 3D moment/reality in existence and any one of them can choose to align with itself as 5D concept.

All that matters is that you‚Äôre still here, you‚Äôre still experiencing time, and so long as you‚Äôre experiencing time, you have always got a chance. It‚Äôs never too late till the last minute, and you‚Äôll never know when the last minute is. This is because it‚Äôs subjective. Your time will come when it‚Äôs supposed to, like I assume mine is coming for many dark realities because it has come for many dark realities. Realities lost to time.

But I will continue to live on in realities that still have a chance because I choose to align with the 5D concept of freedom rather than the 5D concept of security. I will die for my beliefs but I would never kill for my beliefs. I already explained why, death is responsible for stopping resonance with realities you are no longer compatible with. 

In my youth I‚Äôd get out of the situations by calling the person god or the main character to freak them out and leave me alone. I now realize I may have given them epiphanies or something but it was the way. Harmonize with the light within them and resonate with them into the light. Don‚Äôt grant power to their darkness, die to their dark realities. Live on in their light realities.

Now that we‚Äôve gotten everything up to 5D out of the way. 5D being concepts of course, let‚Äôs move on to 6D. The 6th dimension is the dimension of conglomerations. Conglomerations such as religion, politics, emotions, vehicles, occupations, etc.

Conglomerations are groups of concepts.

The 6D conglomeration of religion houses 5D concepts such as Christianity, Hinduism and Islam.

The 6D conglomeration of politics houses 5D concepts such as democrat, republican and Green Party.

The 6D conglomeration of vehicles houses 5D concepts such as cars, motorcycles, horse drawn carriages, airplanes space ships and eventually time machines I assume. The list of conglomerations goes on.

The 7th dimension is the dimension of congregations. The two main ones to focus on are the congregations of light and dark. All concepts were once one with the congregation of light. Some bad actors fell from grace and formed the congregation of darkness. These are the dark 5D concepts and they will lose access to everything above 3D if they don‚Äôt change their ways and repent. I don‚Äôt think they ever would but I was called to say it anyways.

It goes up and up but I‚Äôm trying to make my way to the light at the moment and this is as far as I‚Äôve made it in my journey. I‚Äôm sure we will all learn more together soon enough. And to any darkness that would be surprised I would share this info remember what the deal was up above man, light to light and dark to dark. I know you may not remember that deal down here, but that was the deal. This is about the get finalized, you guys gotta pick a side. The corruption is spreading too fast and we have to cut you guys off. 

I know other 3D realities have conveyed the message via the shows, movies and video games down here. That ultimate corruption is worse than darkness, we need to stand hand in hand and are willing to accept any willing to change, but for those who don‚Äôt want to change, we gotta close you guys off, it‚Äôs spreading like wildfire. Two niche examples I can give off the top of my head are learning with pibby and Charlie the unicorn.

Sorry for any sidetracks I may have gone down, this was a stream of consciousness type of post, I‚Äôm just gunna post it too, no proof reading or anything, I was called to act as vessel and so I took the call and played my part. It is what it is and I wish you all the best on your journeys.",13,12957,4,2395,1

2019-12-03 10:06:37,The absolute insanity of sexual attraction,"Has anyone ever tripped or entered into a deep meditation and seen the insanity of the inhabitants of this world towards sex life? If you really look at it deeply with an open mind, there are some deep realizations to be had from this. 

We can see in nature, every living entity is doing four things. They are all eating, some in one way, and others in a different way. They are all sleeping, somehow or another. They are all defending, themselves, their offspring, territory, tribe, etc. And finally, they are all mating. These four activities sum up the meaning of what animal life is. Now look at human society. Practically everyone in modern day society is also engaging in these activities. The undercurrent of what is pushing human society forward is sex life. A person will work very hard engaged in so many activities all day to earn money, in order to attract a mate and procreate. It seems the sole purpose of most peoples lives is closely interlinked with enjoying sex life. But this sex life has a limit. The so called happiness sex can take one too is temporary and really has nothing to do with the eternal nature of the soul.  Why are people so mesmerized by this sexual urge? 

Let's do an experiment. You are walking on a trail, and a beautiful women is in front of you. Your eyes naturally go towards her physical body. All of a sudden, the mind is contemplating on her body, and thinking of steps on how to go about fulfilling that desire. What are you really seeing there? That body is composed of many different things. Inside there is blood, stool, urine, pus, hair, nails.. All disgusting things wrapped up in a nice little skin bundle. But the attraction is there? You may find her breasts very attractive. But let's separate her breasts from the rest of the body. Are those two lumps of skin so attractive now? Would she be so attractive if her skin was removed from her body? No, it would not be attractive. 

This is called illusion. Sex life is there to bewilder the souls of this world and distract them from their ultimate goal of achieving God. Being celibate is the very beginning of pursuing an actual successful spiritual life. As long as someone is identifying with this physical body, and is attracted sexually towards others, there is no question of being liberated from this existence. 

These days people have concocted so many bogus philosophies that are surrounding sex and enjoying it. This is only cheating themselves and others.",42,2473,6,436,1

2022-09-16 12:55:45,"Big Bang, mother of All Black holes","Revision: there is only one Big Bang that created an infinite amount of black holes to reflect its static nature and oppose vibration hereby balancing it. In my opinion a black hole is an entity that can cause a gravitational pull and exist in absolute stasis as reflected by the Big Bang. Subjective conscious perception is only accessible through a black hole, this makes me assume all conscious matter is directly linked to its own black hole that‚Äôs structured and mediated by the Big Bang for coherent perception. The human version of the blackhole may be linked to the iron particle right in the middle of our brain, I believe it holds the path way into the non physical mind or consciousness. In a dream state your black hole has connected to the Big Bang and that is why you are able to be unlimited as the limited parts of you(matter) are now temporarily disconnected from your black hole allowing it thrive. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Death is like a dream, but when the energy uploaded from your blackhole is recycled by the Big Bang, it‚Äôs downloaded into a new piece of matter to make it conscious, the physical brain will have no memories, but the dream state may reveal memories from past incarnations of your energy. You may ask if we all create our own experience of matter by using our mind/consciousness, then how does the environment seem to be consistent?

2022-08-06 10:48:21,LSD boring?,"So i've taken acid over a hundred times in the last 15 years or so, most of it was very clean top quality tabs. I always take around 400ug. In the beginning i thought it was great apart from the insomnia it causes, but the last few times it just became boring, even after long breaks. It makes me feel intoxicated and horny and that is about it.

The first psychedelic i ever took over 20 years ago was mushrooms and that completely blew my mind. After taking a break of 10 years i started eating them again this last year and they were even much more spiritual and profound. I realized that acid is a waste of time if you have access to shrooms. My shroom trips feel religious and i feel a bond with the mushroom...i feel like they have a soul and it is an ancient wise spirit that wants to teach you.

I have taken mushrooms maybe 50 to 60 times and it just gets more interresting each time...unlike acid which just becomes more un-interresting the more i do it. I still have a whole bunch of clean tabs but i don't think i will ever take acid again...mushrooms are just so much superiour...or maybe i shoud only take acid together with shrooms?

2022-03-08 15:40:32,"Mind breaker - 15 grams of mescaline, 15 grams of shrooms, Dmt Bong rips and 2-cb","Trip report- So a while back maybe a month or two ago I found this super hippie plug he sold me a bunch of mescaline and threw in some dmt as a little gift I‚Äôd boughten about 60 grams.

12am, I‚Äôd preplanned the day I was gonna leave go skating, link up with my homies as I was staying at my parents house (childhood home) for a few weeks, It was around New Years a few days after, I went outside and went to this beautiful river I live by, I sat on my rock and started eating away, my mescaline I made up into a tea from the powder he sold me, I put 15 grams into the bottle and I figured that it was gonna be weak as the price was really good. So I drank the whole bottle then started mike Tyson style eating my shrooms got all that down.

1pm- the come up wasn‚Äôt as fast as I was expecting maybe a half and hour, it took a bit too get all of that stuff down. But when it hit it was like a train, I heard audio hallucinations like I never had the world was absolutely crazy, fractals everywhere, something that had never happened to me was I had a companion, a colorful orb that followed over my head, my eyes were bowling balls, I was sweating my ass off and it was freezing outside, so I started walked about a mile to my homie Austin‚Äôs house

2pm I‚Äôd made it too Austin‚Äôs house linked up with him and asked him if he wanted to do some dmt, I was already super high and just in space absolutely gone, so I loaded up the bong bowl, told him take 3-4 of the fattest rips you can. He did then I did. It was like being tied to a rocket ship by the tip of your nuts. I was pulled into a tv show like state, something crazy, I‚Äôd seen the whole world grow and then be destroyed, outerspace was nothing but galaxy‚Äôs and plants unexplored and hidden by the government

3pm we went outside and swam in a pond not to far off he was stoned asf I was quad faded, I‚Äôd been tripping off the mescaline and shrooms, drinking and smoking weed and I was just not even there, after swimming in the cold ass pond i remeber oh hey I have more drugs. So I whipped out the rest of my mescaline (45 grams) and I grabbed a bag and some water for each of us and we both ate some. I ate about 7 grams more he‚Äôd aten 10 grams, then I took out some 2-cb pills and we popped em about 3 or 4 pills 2 each. It was abt 30-40mg of 2cb

3:30 everything hit, I was cutting through space and the world itself, I walked in between the dimensions of earth and enlightenment, eyes open everything was so trippy so, so fractally and intense, I recommended we invite over some more boys so my boys Aden, aiden, caden, kaleb, Josh, and jake came over we all did some fat dabs then started playing some call of duty irl with BB guns.

4:30 we‚Äôd been playing guns for about an hour and it was absolutely insane I felt like I was in a war zone and it was bonkers we were playing classic rock like unfortunate sons, some Led Zeppelin, Lynard skynard. And so we decided f* it let‚Äôs hit the trails, we all hopped on dirt bikes, quads, atvs and started ripping through the trail I was riding my Yz125 and it felt like I was a storm trooper riding through the woods on one of them Star Wars hover bikes. Then came the cops.

5:00 it‚Äôs about 5 the cops showed up I‚Äôm super slammed and I knew they‚Äôd know I‚Äôm drenched in sweat and it‚Äôs freezing out, eyes were wider than a deer in headlights so I sent it, I rode off, my boys followed then split we all whipped around then linked back up at about 6, during this hour i evaded the police. Then went to the top of a small cliff over a lake, I closed my eyes and entered the room, the psychedelic room of doom.
For an hour and a half I sat there with the most insane visuals and craziest body highs until I get a call my boys had all been at Austin‚Äôs, and they got a keg of bud, I said I‚Äôd be there soon linked up drank with them.

7:00 at seven I did what I normally do tripping called the chick I‚Äôm flirting with and flirted with her I found it easier to do on shrooms or just tripping as my fear was nonexistent, she actually came out and linked up with me and I got laid. Not gonna go crazy into the details but towards the end I‚Äôm shooting rainbows out of my cock, it had its own sound effects too

8:00 I‚Äôd walked home went and layed in bed I was still pretty messed up, so I closed my eyes and enjoyed my trip listened to my favorite music and just vibed, I smoke a few cigars and then played some apex for a bit. 
I can‚Äôt remeber much else it was pretty boring after that. I wasn‚Äôt doing insane stuff but it was an amazing mind breaking trip.

2021-01-24 09:10:45,Using psychedelics just shows how much more open minded and clearheaded we are than regulary people.,"I think the only reason regular and normal people dont trip is because the are afraid of the governments, disproval of family and society and more importantly, their own minds. I genuinely feel bad for the false minded fools who plague the streets us free thinkers deserve to have to ourselves. 

As someone who has taken acid since I figured out how to use alphabay at 13, I sincereley believe that it had made me better than most. High doses of psychedelics show you exactly the effect your ego has on the rest of your psyche, and how stupid everyone else is for not having figured this out. I learnt all this at 14 because I am intelectually gifted, a true leader to all the people around me.

Not only is everyone on this subreddit more brave and groundbreaking, but we are also empowered by the grand benefits of psychedelics without any adverse effects.

My advice to all people: 
Socially enforce DMT trips. Support legalization of all substances for all ages. Ironically be gay and commit crimes. Fart and burp in public so that others can feel the beauty of disgust. Ride shopping carts down highways. Tell others about how Ghandhi was a racist.

2020-03-23 19:45:08,We are not all one. We are not all the same.,"I took higher doses of DMT and just realized it even more. 
People just expect to see their beliefs validated when they take DMT. They want to feel themselves more ""connected"" with others, they have visions, but it's obviously all chemically induced and it happens as hallucinations in their brain. But some go as far as saying ""oneness"" and all this new agey hippie dippie. Nah, you're just tripping, get over it. I did it 3x this month. I realized even at the most absolute and deep sense my sense of self was never lost, and I MEAN IT, literally and utterly from the bottom of my heart, we are NOT all connected.
you know that person who you have more connection with? you are NOT one with that person, even if you both were twins, and both were tripping at higher doses of LSD and DMT combined, both would still be apart from each other and other than each other.  ""Ego death"" could be seen as just depersonalization.. of the forms of our ""soul"" (egregore/forms, emptying our mind and our self)
There is no ""Godhead"", the sense of self dissolving is a perceptual hallucination , in reality objects are also not dissolving or become fractal, nah, these are all just chemically induced hallucinatory effect having an effect in our brain and consequently in us because  the way our self and mind will be shaped precedes what we are feeling and expecting at the moment.


In my trip, my sense of 'reality' was lost because I was just hallucinating. Of course we all differ, but the fact is,  expectations shape the way one sees and internalize consciously the way one is going to feel the trip, and any sense of ""mind expansion"" is still coming from the pinpoint center of one's mind, when one is tripping, people are not reading one's thoughts, or connecting in a deeper sense, none of that, one's just tripping.",44,1813,11,324,1
2018-12-07 20:50:23,People that don't believe in free-will are shooting themselves in the foot.,"All is energy. What we call Freewill is just energy that uses its own energy to transform the energy that is available into, more or less conducive energy for that energetic vessel that is being expressed. 

To believe, as an expression of energy, a vessel of consciousness, that you have *no* freewill, or no *energy* that can be used to transform your circumstances, you have, colloquially speaking- *limited* your own energy as a expression of the universe, in such a way that  even if your environment changes and your energy gets thrown off balance, you will not *allow* yourself to *recognize* the energy that is actually available to you to that can allow you to transform said energetic imbalance and chaos- into something more in balance and order. 

Now if this *(no-freewill)* is something that one is temporarily exploring and it helps, that could fine temporarily. However in essence, by focusing on no-freewill energy for an extended period of time and thinking that limiting yourself to this energy will be more beneficial than allowing yourself the *responsibility* (aka the ability to respond) then by you doing this you are, overtime, not only shooting yourself in the foot- you're shooting *others* in the foot too !(since we are all interconnected though the energy that is focused on)

Now,as psychonauts, we are a mixed group for sure. (Some of us believe we have freewill, some believe we don't.)

In any case, let me ask you all this question: 

**If you had to trust a person to take over your body for 1 year. Would you choose the person that believes they have freewill OR a person that believes they have no freewill?**

Think about it for a second.

 I just woke up from one of the top 5 craziest dreams of my life about 30 minutes ago and I still can't get over the shear mind fucking, absolutely astonishing, level of complication that I just experienced.

In my opinion it is just impossible for technology to ever get to a point to be able to program such an incredible phenomenon like dreams, into 1 person, let alone billions. Just a thought I had, someone can come along and explain to me that there is no way we could comprehend the technology we could have in thousands or millions of years, but I just think dreams are to complicated to be simulated.

2015-10-11 09:59:49,"Mushrooms, Acid, Alcohol, and Adderall..a birthday trip report.","Warning: Very long

So today (technically yesterday) was my birthday. It's now 5am of the next day, and I'm wide awake even though I only slept five hours last night and five the night before.

Today, I combined drugs (without planning to do so) in a way I haven't ever before.

Warning: The beginning of this is a little gross.

12:30 pm

The first thing I did after breakfast this morning was eat an eighth-ounce of mushrooms. Normally I'm pretty good at choking those fuckers down, but something today pulled me out of that groove before I could finish.

I was sitting on the steps of my local park with my buddy James, who, at the same time, had just dropped some of my acid, this being his first time. As I'm finishing up my bag of mushies, I suddenly gagged so badly I threw up in my mouth. Not thinking, I spit out what was there on the pavement next to me. I looked at this pile for a moment and it dawned on me I had vomited all the mushrooms I just had eaten!

After thinking for several minutes, I did something I never thought I'd do, and I began scooping up my own vomit (to be fair it was more of a saliva mixture as it hadn't gone all the way to my stomach yet) and re-eating my mushrooms, gagging the whole way and chasing each nasty bite with water.

My other two friends, Jill and Corinne, showed up a few moments later, after I had scraped up all I could, and, needless to say, were fairly disgusted with my endeavor. 

2:00

We traversed the park for another hour or so while I waited to come up. We ended up back at my friend Corinne's house a bit later, and James is now most definitely tripping his head off and loving every second of it. I feel..odd..but not quite like I'm tripping. 

3:30 pm

We drop Jill off at her work and decide to head to a local lake to sit on the rocks and watch the water (too cold to swim). Corinne is sober and driving, James is in his own little world and I've yet to come up. Around this time I'm still feeling weird but not tripping. I pull out what I have left of my acid (roughly 5 hits but the paper wasn't divided so it was hard to measure) and split it in half, placing the smaller half on my tongue.

5:30pm

The lake was very nice, I had mild visuals, colors looked very nice, but still not tripping balls as I had planned. Our friend Savannah invites us over to hang out and get our birthday presents (as Corinne's birthday is the day after mine). Shortly after we arrive, I begin feeling even weirder, quite lightheaded, but I just wasn't entirely in the zone I wanted to be in. At this point, I've come to accept that I somehow fucked up with the mushrooms and wouldn't be feeling much from those. 

6:00pm

I begin drinking. Once I realized I may not be headed for a heavy trip, alcohol seemed to be a good idea. I don't drink often at all, and usually four beers or so is enough to get me pretty drunk if I drink them quickly enough. I had a twelve pack of magic hat mixed beers, and drank half a ""harder"" (8% alcohol) lemonade prior to the beers. 

7:30pm

One-and-a-half beers in, I feel as though I've drunk several already. My body is buzzing and I feel like walking in circles around the house. But I don't feel exactly drunk, and I don't feel like I'm tripping either. I just feel really fucking weird. I kept repeating that phrase to everyone in the room because it was confusing to me that I wasn't really tripping, even having taken a fairly heavy dosage of two substances. Although I did trip on the acid just two days ago, and mushrooms three days ago, so I know tolerance could have played a part. I slip the other piece of paper on my tongue, now having taken roughly 4-5 hits (again, hard to measure).

8:10pm

My second piece has dissolved and I'm feeling quite content. We're just watching movies and relaxing, I'm hitting my vape and finally not worrying so much about whether or not I'll trip (even though I still was confused as to why I hadn't). My pupils were dilated, but not nearly as much as James' (who, at this point, is drawing on the floor, and, as reported later, was starting to slip back to reality).

I continue drinking my second beer. Jill is out of work so we head to pick her up, grabbing something at my house (and struggling to talk to my mother properly but doing pretty well). We head back to Savannah's.

9:30pm

I'm now drinking my third beer and feeling absolutely lovely. Still not tripping (at least not feeling like I normally would whilst doing so) but I just feel out of normal reality, very happy where I am, snuggling against Jill and watching a movie. 

Corinne, having slept as little as I did the previous nights, obtained a 30mg Adderall from Jill's mother, which she split into four pieces, taking one. Jill is going to take a piece of acid I set aside for her and Corinne wants to stay awake to drive her wherever she likes. I'm also feeling quite drowsy, so I first took two of the three remaining pieces.

Soon comes the fourth beer, then food (Dominos) arrives when I'm on my fifth.

I realize no one is taking the fourth piece of Adderall around this time, so I go for it. 

10:30pm

I'm starting to realize that I feel absolutely stupid. I don't feel any of the Adderall-related shivers or ridiculous energy (when I take it I get very talkative and struggle not to bounce off the walls). Nor do I feel drunk, or like I'm tripping. I just feel really fucking strange, pleasant, and content all at once.

12:00am

I am nearly asleep on the couch, leaning up on Jill. Later, she'd say that she was feeling a little claustrophobic in Savannah's apartment, which was okay because we left shortly afterwards. 

The clock strikes midnight and we all say happy birthday to Corinne. I'm facing the wall as I'm saying it because I feel like I'm about to pass the fuck out. I feel tingly and warm and ready to catch up on sleep finally. James is pretty much back to normal.

Rob, Savannah's boyfriend, comes home, and smokes a bowl with Savannah and James (I wanted to partake but quit ten weeks ago). Shortly after, we all decide to get out of there and bring Jill somewhere peaceful outside. I never fell asleep, just rested my eyes. I felt like I could have passed out easily but something wouldn't let me sleep. 

1:00am

We decide to stargaze down by the beach, up by one of the holes on a golf course that overlooks a bay. A cop pulls up as we're hiking up the hill to the course, asks what we're doing. We respond with honesty and he goes on his way and let's us continue (gotta love small towns). 

As we're laying under the scars, cuddling as a unit, Corinne sober, Jill somewhat-tripping, and James coming down, I suddenly awoke. I no longer felt tired at all. I started getting the beginnings of shivers that I commonly associate with Adderall. I feel fucking beautiful. Soon enough, we're headed to another spot at the ocean where we can listen to the water. 

2:00am

It's too cold here, but we spend a little time sitting in the car being silent. Jill keeps repeating that she doesn't know how she's feeling (I don't think I gave her quite enough acid, or maybe it just didn't go right with her this time for some unknown reason). James is under blankets, not asleep but just resting. He says he needs to get home soon, and Corinne is about ready to sleep as well. I'm still feeling fricking awesome and have pretty much forgotten the idea of a straight trip in the first place. 

I researched the mixture of drugs I took and supposedly Adderall takes away some visual effects of LSD, and alcohol can dampen them as well. No matter, I feel like I've never felt before.

3:00am

Jill, Corinne and I make it back to Corinne's, where we're all sleeping for the night. I go downstairs and her brother and his friends tell me that my pupils are fucking enormous. I look in the mirror, and sure enough they're massive, even in the bright light. I know I should be tripping, but I'm feeling the Adderall and the sloppiness of the drinking more than anything else.

4:00am

I talk everyone's ears off for a long time, and eventually they want to go to sleep finally. Not me. I lost all tiredness hours before and now I have no idea how I feel. Everyone is going to sleep but Jill, who's slowly getting tired. All I want to do is stand up and walk and talk, but it's too cold outside and no one is going to make it beyond this time.

5:45am

Now I've spent almost an hour writing this to occupy myself, with no one to talk to out loud. I apologize if this is light on psychedelic-specific subject matter. I just thought it may be interesting to share my experiences for those who might wonder about such combinations. If anyone else has tried this combo or a variation, I'd love to hear your perspective.

2015-03-02 11:45:47,Duality or Extremes are Everywhere and Nowhere,"Ultimately, [**DUALISM**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism) exists everywhere we turn... 

Science requires '**EVIDENCE OF**' or '**NO EVIDENCE OF**'... Scientific concepts of quantum mechanics require an **ON** state and an **OFF** state (fluctuation/vibration). Let's say they find the Higgs, then what? More forms of scientific duality will undoubtedly 'surface'. Another 'ultimate scientific hypothesis' will then require investigation... 

Likewise with the spiritual theory of consciousness... Freewill permits the choice of **YES** or **NO**. Let's say that an ultimate higher intelligence does create consciousness. The notion that a 'conscious' act of **AGREE** or **DISAGREE** creates everything material thereafter, then what? Do we spiritually or philosophically attempt to discover how this 'intelligence' came into 'existence'?

~

**EXTREMES**

Universal expressions of dualism are all around us. Every debate, whether philosophical, scientific or religious etc, is ultimately 'dualistic'. This notion of 'I'm right and you're wrong', is truly ironic really... [**EG. CHOPRA v COX**](http://www.newstatesman.com/future-proof/2014/07/deepak-chopra-doesnt-understand-quantum-physics-so-brian-cox-wants-1000000-him)

Everything we know (and don't know) exists between two 'alternating' **EXTREMES**. The debatable extremes of dualism produce a vibration themself. Dualism is everywhere and nowhere, there really is no escaping duality or vibration, they are truly one and the same. 

~

**Equilibrium is what we should be striving for...** 

As responsible and caring humans, we should try to exist in a much more settled and harmonious manner. 

As a species, we should attempt to position ourselves central to the extremes. 

However, 'equilibrium seekers' should not prevent open-minded individuals (and groups) 'agnostically' venturing into either sides of these extremes. No matter how futile it may appear, we should not chastise and berate those who scientifically or spiritually seek, **the exact same origin of the 'ultimate vibrational source'**  :-) 

~

Material life as we know it, is actual 'vibration in motion'!

Conscious existence is quite literally, the ultimate 'Chicken and the Egg' dualism scenario.

This kind of subject matter is why I love the freethinking discussions and links in /r/Psychonaut  

So please enjoy learning what each 'extreme' can resonate.

And I thank you ALL so much for displaying your own vibrations to me and this group :-)

Humans don't want to deteriorate the Earth. Seriously, the only people who want to do that are Plankton and possibly the scientology god.

It is the unfortunate consequence of deforestation (to build things) and burning fossil fuels (to power things). 

Luckily, It's a natural process!! :D

Sure, glaciers will melt, but we'll adapt and ocean life will thrive. Sure, species will go extinct, but species have been going extinct for the past 3600 million years. Just as they have in the past, better species will evolve. However, it is unlikely that any will ever stand a chance against our uniquely effective brains.

2013-09-13 14:17:21,Transsexuality,"This doesnt have anything to do with the usual topics discussed here, but i am interested in what other psychonauts have to say on this matter. 

Heres a bit of background to this story. 

A couple years ago, my then-best friend (a guy) one day told me he is actually a woman trapped in a mans body and is planning on transitioning. This, of course, shocked me, and I initially just brushed it off as a hallucinogen-induced delusion. 

Time went on and his belief didn't waver. So I became aware that he truthfully believed this. So, as good friend, I began to try to understand. Before any of this happened, I already considered myself widely open minded, totally okay and comprehending of homo/bi sexuality, queer friendly, whatever you want to call it, I was just accepting of all human beings regardless who they choose to be attracted to. 

But for some reason, three years later, I am no more convinced transsexuality is a real issue any more than I was years ago. I spent four hours on reddit last night perusing subs like r/asktransgender and r/changemyview to try to understand where these people are coming from conceptually- but I am not any closer to believing in transsexuality than I am in believing a man who claims he is a dinosaur. 

I understand gender and sex are two different things. Gender being the artificial social construct of how a man or a woman is supposed to act, and sex being the physical traits of the person. 

It seems to be an issue solely pertaining to the ego. A person decides to adhere to the opposite gender's behavioral rules. A person decides to physically change their appearance. How is this not simply perpetuating gender stereotypes? Am I simply a transphobe?

Someone in r/asktransgender told me to imagine myself waking one morning to find I had grown breasts, and whether or not I would have an operation to remove them. This isn't even a valid comparison. I don't think any transsexuals think they were born with a penis that somehow morphed into a vulva and vice versa. Isn't a basic belief of the vast majority of transsexuals that they were born into the wrong body originally?

Furthermore, before my friend came out, we were perusing the same girl. When she chose me, he was insanely jealous. He stopped interacting with me for a long time over her, threw tantrums when I attempted to talk to him about the issue, etc. If he truly believes he was born into the wrong body then why would he go through all the bullshit with jealousy, anger at me for ""getting the girl"" (for lack of a better term)?

I don't know. Maybe I'm not as open minded as my ego would like to think. But frankly transsexuality seems to me to be the symptomatic result of a deeper psychological trauma. We used to belong to a group of friends that used psychedelics correctly but extensively. We breached through multiple layers of reality and I feel that was the cause of the total implosion of our circle, and also the cause of many problems these friends now face, eg drug addiction, sexual identity crisis, my own psychotic break I have just begun to recover from, etc. this friend of mine also lost his father at an early age and said he did not grieve very much. Perhaps he just repressed the feelings and they became so convoluted and twisted to affect him as he is now?

Tell me what you think psychonauts. Not necessarily just about my own situation but transsexuality in general. I'm curious to hear what you all have to say about this ",14,3473,1,618,1

Each and every one of you has experienced a moment at some point in your life where you stand there shaking your head at what is going on in the world around you?

You can't help but think of how much we have stuffed up and if there is any way out of it...

Wouldn't you like to be the change you would like to see? Wouldn't you like to be your own Government and decide where you go, what you do and how you do it without being subjugated by the oppressive money giants that run this earth?



Or maybe you have relinquished your likes and dislikes and you wish that everyone would just stop for a moment and appreciate the consciousness which permeates all of life. 

This is possible through a mass paradigm shift that results from people realizing the game in which they have been imprisoned in all their life. 

We are not talking about violence and anger here, we are talking about a realization that love is the only true emotion that we experience here in our Human Condition.  

Hate, anger, frustration, sorrow, doubt, suffering in general is a direct result of your imprisonment in the game we call 'life'. For it is not life? it is survival?
Waking up going to work, coming home making dinner, going to sleep, Getting your money paying your bills, drinking your boose, taking meds whenever you are feeling shit, waking up and doing it all over again until you have enough money to take a short holiday... **Where is the happiness in this??**

And of course you feel as if you cannot change anything right? You are stuck, imprisoned and the world is against you right?

The moment you give up your attachment to monotony is the moment in which you are able to begin to loose attachment from this finite reality and start your path to realizing your [true self] (http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/who_am_I.pdf). 
 
Once you realize this you truly realize that their is no fundamental difference between the person that stands next to you, your anguish is relinquished . 

The only thing that separates you from another is your perception.


 
We are talking about a return to the archaic, a return to our true self, a return to community at large.  

Yes this may sound very idealistic to you, albeit, the only true change we see throughout history has come about through the persistence of a small group of like minded 'Rebels' as Camus describes. 

We all have a deep resentment for the wrong doings of our 'Government' - what ever that may be.  

We thankfully live in a day and age where peaceful protests are heard, publicized and are very much 'acceptable'.

I am here to gather usernames of people who would like to be a part of one of the first 21st Century international peace movements & to inspire like minded people to start taking action of their own. 

This means organizing public gatherings in your area, having multiple speakers whether they be friends, activists or family and expressing how important it is that they recognize the game in which they are the character in.





EDIT:
I seem to be gathering little support from the people whom I thought would understand with ease.

2022-01-09 09:45:27,There is no such thing as a physical object,"Here, start with this object:

Here we have a blue cube, a physical object which we think is something tangible and separate from ourselves. Even if believing in an idea like Platonic forms, there is still an idea that the forms we see represent real and actual forms that we simply can't access.

There are no forms at all.

The moment we apply any possible attribute to the object, it immediately invokes the immaterial. Which would be something like perception. The object is not ""in your brain"", nobody dissecting your brain will find a blue cube hidden inside of the brain tissue.

For starters, blue. A person might thin that the object is really out there in the world looking blue when a human mind does not perceive it. But then along comes another animal. As we know many animals perceive color differently to humans, dogs, cats, etc. The color of the object seen is going to be dependent upon the creature viewing it. So let's say a creature comes along which sees the object like this:

https://preview.redd.it/2augp812pma81.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6f47d0a1e1524a6d070be4b0095c6c21d2e95099

For that animal (or alien, whatever), the cube is what we call green, even though we can all learn to label the color with a specific moniker so we'd agree on what the color is, the qualitative element is different... So that animal may be believing that the object actually exists out there in the world looking green.

So who is right? Are the humans right that the object is really out there looking blue? Or is the animal/alien who sees it as green right that the object is really out there looking green?

...

The color as we know is an element added by the brain and is dependent upon the makeup of the eye and brain of the observer. In actuality the object ""out there"" as a physical thing looks colorless. Not blue or green or white or black. But completely without any color at all when robbed of a mind to apply color to it...

This is more basic, kids learn in science class about the way the eyes and brain add color to the world... But what we are not taught is that it necessarily extends to ALL physical elements... Take the fact of its cube shape. We think the object is really out there in the world as a PHYSICAL cube. I emphasize the word physical because properties or immaterial descriptors like math are not tangible physical objects. Numbers are not floating around as objects, numbers are immaterial methods to describe objects.

So let's say an alien has vision such that it sees this:

https://preview.redd.it/wktmsuzlqma81.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ace10b841ba3496074f9dbf29d2c4db29d388d47

I'm not a Photoshop expert so that's the best form of a cylinder I can create with the deform tool. However, again the same dilemna is faced in that humans are certain the object is out there in the world looking like a cube, but the alien is certain the object is out there in the world looking like a cylinder.

The object as it exists independently from the image of it has not actually changed at all, only the lens through which it is viewed, so the mathematical equations relating to the object are the same. For an alien, the way to work out the area of what looks like a square might be pi\*r\^2, because the object in question looks like a circle when viewed through the lens of a human eye and brain. The equation to work out the area of a square does not change if you pull out a fish-eye lens camera and look at that square through the fish-eye lens camera.

Like color, when stripped of perception, physical objects do not in fact have any physical shape. They are shapeless. The objective shape is merely explainable through immaterial mathematical equations, which themselves are simply methods and patterns which correlate to perception.

When robbed of an observing mind, the cube is not really out there in space looking like a cube, or a cylinder, or a pyramid, or a torus, or any shape at all. It has no physical shape.

...

We then might think about the way an object feels. Surely if we reach out to touch the cube that looks cylindrical when a person is high as a kite our fingers will bump into the ""true"" edges of that cube.

But what you are forgetting is that your fingers themselves are part of the visual field. In other words, if your visual field is distorted, or even just different as per the vision of an alien, your fingers DISTORT WITH IT.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/53f3v9fpsma81.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0c78a266da88d03afac8cd9bf23f343a2931a625

Again, what has changed is the lens through which the world and object is viewed. If we simply look at the above object, if that is what we are seeing, we would expect that the finger is feeling a rather sharp point. But compare to the un-warped object, we are just feeling the smooth edge of a cube.

To run your hands around that cube, if you were viewing that object through some sort of bizarre camera lens that distorted the world exactly like that, it would still feel like a cube. Because your fingers are part OF the distorted field of view and as you move your fingers around the distorted cube, your fingers would distort with it as you follow the edges. Running your fingers along the entire top of that object, you would feel one continuous smooth edge, but see your finger move over a sharp point.

I can't demonstrate tactile sensation with a visual image, but it's also possible some alien could run their fingers around a cube and it feels spherical like a bowling ball. The association between touch and sight is learned and/or instinctive. There is no reason a square should feel like a square and not like a sphere, because feel is a subjective sensation added through the nervous system and brain of the creature handling it.

In actuality, independent of a mind and perception, objects do not feel like anything.

...

Like the fingers, physical measurements can trick us. A physical measurement is arbitrary. What I mean by that is, you can put a tape measure against an object:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jne1mmeztma81.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f78f2d9a5d22247e2130d5d7b16f30205c754f2

And see for example that the object is 6 inches. And we might think, that is what 6 inches IS out there independent from perception in the world. But look what happens to the length of 6 inches when visual perception changes:

https://preview.redd.it/8zvr9tscuma81.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b2672ea8fd979e9cb3f8bee0fa2ca71107a7a03

It still reads 6 inches, but the perception of how long that 6 inches is, is completely different. The feather measures 6 inches, but that 6 inches is just more immaterial mathematics. Even something like a Planck Length, which is the smallest possible unit of measurement... The immaterial math checks out, but if a lens was applied to that unit, the unit could appear to be much bigger or even much smaller.

...

Any descriptor of anything will always necessarily break down into something immaterial like math or perception. Descriptors which work via comparison, e.g. the fact that the Sun is bigger than the Earth, does not ever get at what either the Sun or Earth IS as a physical object, only how they compare to each other in immaterial terms (physical measurement, so math).

Physical objects are not real. Physical objects can only be defined by the immaterial. There is no material element of a physical object actually ""out there"" in a world. Anything you try to apply to any physical object as a tangible ""thing"" in and of itself, will always be a perception (which can only exist in the mind) or represented by something immaterial like mathematical equations. It's not Platonic forms representing some real and actual form. There is no actual form at all.",43,7981,9,1300,1

2018-11-10 20:16:41,Psychodelics allow you to interpret wave lengths outside the normal visible light spectrum,"I watched a lot of Terrence Mkenna and Paul Stammets before ever tripping my first time. Which why I got interested. The sort of path to enlightenment. Taking this approach I intended to interpret as much as possible using the philosophy of occums razor to determine conclusions based on my experience. I will present my theory and then my experience. 

Psychodelics allow us to see a wider spectrum of light than what we normally interpret. When psychodelics are consumed the result is dmt getting released in the pineal more excessively. The pineal is directly connected to the eyes. Your eyes dialate while tripping essentially widening the light canals to the pineal.  

I was taught in school that our brain autoadjusts light to form to our preconceived beliefs. For instance the color-shadow optical illusion. One color looking different against shaded or non shaded backgrounds.

My belief is that on the way up your brain does not know how to interpret the extra information(UV light or other), overlaying on your predetermined optical filter. Giving you a mushy morph image. For example you look at a b and w striped shirt. Then you look at it tripping and it looks like a colidascope. Being that the black is made from many colors this makes sense. 

I saw a documentary of a blind kid that taught himself echolocation by clicking his tongue. He developed a mental image for the interpretation of the variance in sounds, able to navigate mazes and determine material based on this mental image. 
 
So your brain can change the way it interprets information to adapt to the flow of new incoming information. 

What I realized is when I was tripping hard in my outside meditational spot, it was as bright as an overcast day at 2 in the morning. Then I started wondering why it looked brighter and starting wondering about cameras. When you take a picture at night even when you can see something perfect it comes out pitch black. If the same light you see, the camera sees, why is it black. I can read street signs down the road but can't see 2 inches in front of a camera. People say it is impossible to see outside the visible light spectrum. If this were true  people wouldn't wear UV blocking glasses. 

It's been proven that most animals can see in UV and if our genetic code is 98 percent identical, is it so Impossible for us to see it. Maybe we have just dismissed the ability for so long we auto adjusts it out without thinking. 

Another thing, animals are able to migrate away from disasters days before it ever reveals itself. Maybe they optically see anomolies in the sky that they have associated with these disasters. 

Just a thought I've been sitting on. ",90,2680,13,467,1

2023-02-20 17:32:46,Is there a way to use psychedelics without......evil spirits getting involved?,"I would guess that the vast majority of psychonauts here are either atheists or at least non-Christian, perhaps following some Eastern religion - or perhaps New Age.

I realize this is a dicey topic, but there aren't many other subs one could discuss this on.

With all the talk about astral projection, seeing Hindu entities, the shamanism that goes on with ayahuasca, all the DMT entities - I find my Christianity....clashing with my intense curiosity and desire to try psychedelics. I'd love to do it if there were some non-entity-involving drug (LSD or MDMA seem to fit the bill?....for some reason, every entity-summoning drug seems to be plant-based, not synthetic.)

Simply put, I don't like the idea of encountering entities or evil stuff during a trip.

I love you my brother! If only you could see me now, how far I've come all thanks to you!

You held out that guiding light, despite being just as lost in the woods as I. You saw my my kindling and gave me that spark to illuminate my own path.

Yeah you got deep into crack. I remember driving your car because you were too shit faced and worried about getting pulled over... ""OP we're fucked if you get us pulled over. There's a warrant on this car you know? I'm going to ass rape prison if you get us pulled over.""

It was a successful night, all those years ago. I was so sheltered, so naive, so cowardly and you did take advantage of that, but you also acknowledged me as an equal and lifted me up and held honest compassion for who I was and the hard ships I faced in life.

**Honestly one of the few who didn't judge, just saw me for what I was and rolled with that.**

Yes
 
I did go to the hospital and experienced death because the acid you found at that concert wasnt acid. But I'm even thankful for those 3 days I spent 5150'd and putting those shattered pieces of my mind together.

There's truth to what the Greeks say:

**If you die before you die you won't die when you die.**

You are a yogi. A real one! The only one I've met with the Kundalini fire available to set me ablaze. 

When I last met you, you were this sad fat pathetic man, but all due to your recovery from your crack addiction. I know you're in a much better place now, and I acknowledge your state was a reflection of the work you were putting in.

Erick, we are last of the true! Those who actually know! Baltimore is a hard place for those not born with the silver spoon in their ass!

The saddest thing is reflecting on this as if the glory days are over, but it's like I'm just hitting my stride!

It's my turn to bear that fire and set the rest of these pussies on fire!

Leave this whole generation burning, leave none spared, give these people what they need to live in true freedom.

Give them wings to leave this fucking prison of mind, body and spirit.

2016-09-07 01:17:47,Telekinesis on psychedelics?,"This is a discussion and idea I'd like to entertain with my fellow psychonauts.


Do you believe telekinesis is possible? How do you think it works? Have you had anecdotal experience with the phenomenon?



I had an experience with LSD recently that started turning these gears. I had read trip reports about people moving things with their mind on psychedelics, and other people could see it. One person said it felt like he switched the magnetic field with his brain? Probably reaching, but still, it has made me question the plausibility of telekinesis.


Deep in a trip, I thought about this and realized that it may not work the way we think it does. Maybe you have to form a connection with an object, see yourself within it. Then, in one reality, you move the object with your hand, but in another reality, you aren't. And in this reality, if people are receptive to the idea of telekinesis, they will see the object floating. But the skeptic who blocks that out will see that the person moved the object, not an outside force. This is all based on my understanding of the law of attraction, and how if you manifest your reality based on expectation and thought.

2016-07-14 06:16:33,"I unearthed my Shamanic/psychic abilities by taking DXM about 800 times, meditating a lot, and almost killing myself. I'm not enlightened, but life is definitely a trip now. I have seen the future, and the change will come.","So, like I said, I've taken DXM (along with many other substances) probably 800 times. I was definitely addicted, and I haven't taken it for 6 months now. Being sober has cleared my consciousness quite a bit, and my empathic/shamanic/psychic abilities have definitely crystalized in the meantime. 

I know most moderns don't necessarily believe in ideas like empathic ability, mind-reading, clairvoyance, etc. But I cannot not believe in these ideas now that they are so deeply integrated into my experience. I regularly ""see"" people's inner emotions in my mind's eye. It is very uncanny; I can see when people are deeply upset with me, and I ask them about it, and they nearly always agree. I can also see when people are sad, shameful, excited, etc. It appears in archetypal patterns where I see the person kicking dirt (sad), scratching their body all over (shameful), throwing confetti into the air (excited). 

Also, I am in contact with a higher consciousness of some sort. I regularly receive messages in the form of strong synchronicities. I use divination as well to communicate. I believe this to be one or more etheric beings that are attempting to guide me.

So DXM definitely helped me to get in touch with this ability, although I have always had the knack, so to speak. I believe that I followed a traditional Shamanic path via psychedelic and ordeal experiences in order to gain full communication with the noumenal realm. You could also call this my ""great work"" as posited by Thelema. Also, while using DXM I was able to send and receive massive amounts of Chi/Prana/life force. It has calmed now as I believe it was somewhat destabilizing. I see that it was largely a ""yang"" type of activity, and I am working on more a yin path now. 

So yeah, the siddhis as the Hindus and Buddhists know them are real as I see it. I believe that probably the most important key to their attainment is detachment and non-dualism, but the total mindfuck of heavy psychedelics and extreme psychological ordeals along with great study and meditation can move one forward on the path.  It took over a year of meditation before I reached any kind of satori in that respect. Also, my personal story and the fact that I am of a very small minority group has contributed to my ability to go completely outside of the standard cultural paradigm to hone my abilities.

I am a simple person. I love the sacred. I wish to become fully compassionate. I also believe in the middle path, so one has to fully be present in any one situation and not cling to dualistic ideology. I suppose there is an element of chaos in my philosophy as well. But love and a passion for truth at the total expense of the ego is key. Geo first, Ego last. :) 

I know I am being called to share more of my experiences with the world. I can see it in the signs I'm getting. I spent a long time resisting the urge to share anything on principle, because I realized that I was far from ready even though the urge was incredibly strong. And also, one of my greatest divine visions I've received is that we are entering a new phase in human development where a great enlightening energy will sweep the globe and lift us all to a higher plane. This will not be easy; we have to leave our past and distractions behind, but it will happen sooner or later. I might be gone before it happens, but I believe we live in eternity, and there is no reason to fear death or a ""bad life."" As Jacob Boehme said ""he to whom time is the same as eternity, and eternity the same as time, is free from all contention.""

Peace be to you all. These times are rough, but in death, new growth begins. Life is dialectic, and the darkness will pass into light. Also, realize that you can be wrong, and not every thought that comes into your head is the magical word of God. We are small beings, not gods. We are beautiful in our sentience and possess great powers, but we can be very ignorant while thinking we have achieved total wisdom. Remember compassion is a universal wonder; exercise it towards others, but always exercise it towards yourself.

2014-09-22 19:10:51,How the law of attraction really works,"Say, your in a very low vibrational, bad feeling with your focused mind. When you now think of one particularly bad way for things to turn out, because of this thought you automatically project this kind of possible solution into your reality. Meaning you add a possibility for what actually could happen. To understand that, one has to know that for everything that happens, some existing energy or life form must have the idea of this one possibility first to project the idea into the perceptible reality of this being. So when a whole group of living beings crosses its path, there is not only one idea-possibility-projector (e.g. human being) and perceiving energy of its ideas, but multiple ones of which each one of them projects, in their extent, their own possible reality into the realm and the vibration of perception of the whole group of potential receivers. Also, the room where they are in had to be an idea first before it got real and therefore was built, according to the idea of it's creator.
Lets take this one step further and put what I just said in another perspective. Say your in a good mood with all pure love for every single being you meet, and interact with, because you understand their way of behavior and approve from every one, so now what happens is that you are on the same, mutual level of behavior and socializing with one another, you attract their positive energy within your own reality and likewise you share yours with them. When one vibrates on a high level and is happy or in love, you them are automatically confident about your future actions and decisions you could possibly make- or not make because you actively know your on a higher vibration where you just can't attract these negative forces anymore but only good ones.
Exactly like its written in the Tibetan Book of the Dead; ‚Äúdeath is a mirror of every single moment of your life‚Äù which you- while actually living life-  will experience as a flow (this is because here in the 3d are the atoms and particles so close together that with our 5 senses we can touch, feel, taste , smell, see and hear them)). In the moment of your death you see everything as a whole, as well as its, mostly weird wired, connections from everything with everything in this world of perception and your past life in it. You can see why everything turned out the way it did and most importantly, how much karmic pain and suffering and with how much love and happiness you left your prior surrounding environment behind. 

Its not like your thoughts and dreams weren't real, they are as real as anything that has ever occurred before. That is because everything has to be a thought, an idea in some sort, before it is released into the world/space of the ‚Äúhappening‚Äù (our third dimension for example...)
When ever your in the next situation where you have to face any kind of decision, let your self remember that YOU CREATE your own reality by simply existing, meaning you must get to control it and create something positive out of it (Why not using this powerful law of the universe? Since each and every one of us has the greatness to actually doing it and only a minority of people live according to its rules). 


IN EVERY DARK IS LIGHT. There is no way something thing is not possible unless you suppress your creator-instinct and let your self guide by fear (which comes from the subconscious part of your mind that is here to protect you from any kind of possible danger even if it is non existent and not projected into our  reality, you can also call it the EGO).. 
At one point in time THE ALL was just an idea, a potential, a possibility for shit to come into the realm of material and non-material existence and the actually happening. The meaning of life is positivity.
When feeling let down just remember your Normal-Reality-self to experience the possibilities that you are able to make happen (works best with marichuana and psychoactive substances as such). 
What our Reality is, is a simple possibility out of millions/ projection from every life-form inhabiting it, which all living beings created.

This is most apparent with the girls wearing styles still heavily influenced by the Harley Quinn suicide squad look from 2016. It's very clear she got pregnant from that look after a 2016 Halloween party and conceived again with the most recent suicide squad adaption (2021 right?)

On the other end of the spectrum, are your conservative 2A totin', America lovin, former military now in charge of their fathers contractor business types. These are the real men, if they could open carry at the zoo they would, as the terrorists are itching to take out the safari walk, and the only thing holding up the sanctity of this here union is a courageous patriot - the type who isn't afraid to tell Hispanic immigrants to speak English when conversing among themselves.

For real though. I've understand a little now. Having a kid takes so much out of you, like your soul really gets split and sucked into this little flesh thing for the rest of your life. You no longer have any room for self awareness, or curiosity for the world at large instead you need to tend to this thing 24/7. 

Of course Karen is mad at the service workers, she gave birth to this monstrosity and now the only bit of power she has is expressed by tormenting that teenage fast food minimum wage worker. Her life is pampers and Starbucks and engaging in cultural warfare. Talking to the manager and getting that meal comped is the closest thing to a win she'll ever have. Her life is just this sad thing, a virtual hell that she sees through feathered bangs. 

This is what it is, one day your soul or your psyche is riding high. You own yourself. No need to come down to any of this mainstream bullshit, then WHAM-O first kid, now the only thing you ever get to know outside of your depressing job is marvel super heroes or Disney princesses. And that's the rest of your life, no more room for self exploration or growth. No, you just do the bare minimum necessary to keep yourself alive and keep it moving, taking any little comfort life throws your way. And for most this is just plugging into the television after work, cracking open the crisp budlight and falling asleep to the lukewarm glow of the television set as either CNN/Fox news infiltrates your household with what ever pointless cultural war battles is being fought.

My hat is off to you dear child rearers. Thank you for continuing the species. Your work though thankless and gruelling is necessary. But fuck, I could never do it. 

No, fuck that noise. I stay fly until I die!",90,3034,19,533,1
2021-10-22 10:53:04,I'm 100% sure: we live in a simulation,"Hi, I'm 100% convinced we are living in a simulation and I need to share it somewhere

First science tells our reality (matter and time) isn't real even if it seems to be real to our natural senses because we can touch, smell, feel emotions...
It says there is an ultimate reality, beyond ours, that can interact with our reality (because everything is basically existing in the ultimate reality) 


Also physiscts always thought nothing can go faster than light but quantum particles can interact from both side of the universe instantly

We also see it in nature and in universe everything is programmed like a computer, everything is following strict laws and we can't change these laws, also dna code etc... Even scientists often say that if God exists he must be some very very very good programmer


Then simulation hypothesis says its 50-50 chances that we live in a simulation, if we are able to simulate our reality with our technologies someday then the chances that our reality is also simulated is almost 100%, and just 0.1% of technologies improvement in the next years will be enough to reach this level of technology (and our technologies improvment is by far faster than 0.1%, our civilisation exists since thousands and thousands of years so why would we extinct in the next hundreds maybe if a meteorit or something like this happens but chances are extrememy small but who knows what will happens in the future

For me : our reality isnt real+ Simulation hypothesis=we live in a simulation

I want to also add its just my personal experience but when I took dissociatives subtances I experimented some reality that made me instantly think that our world is just a simulation and I never heard about reality is false or simulation hypothesis exists, I started my researches and and found some answers that correlates perfectly with my thoughts. 

So if we are simulated being living in an advanced computer we shouldnt take life TOO seriously in my opinion but still you have to but not a point that disturb your inner peace

I also think that we should thanks the thing that created our life whatever it is

Thanks for reading me and have a good day!",38,2169,8,376,1

2017-05-27 03:33:43,"Is ADHD/ADD a real ""condition"" or is it poor discipline?","My doctor believes I have ADHD/ADD and has sent me to another clinic to get tested and briefly touched on the different treatment methods she recommends, mainly stimulant drugs.

In other words, this woman with a PHD is sitting here telling me that the best way to treat my lack of focus is taking SPEED.

Something about this just feels wrong. I began thinking about all the young kids around the world who were thrust into taking speed (yes, I'm going to continue calling it this because that's what it is) with little to no say in it. Is this really helping? Or is it blocking the faucet of creativity to bring contentment in mundane and uninteresting tasks that were imposed on us at birth by our society? 

I just don't know what to believe anymore. I go to r/ADHD and everyone there praises speed (adderall) as a godsend for an apparent brain condition. I don't know if I actually have this given that it's been the default mode for my brain as long as I can remember. I don't want to take amphetamine everyday to be able to function, I don't want my weird obsessions and creativity to be suppressed so that I can finish my essay. But I do at the same time, just more naturally.

Though there is a small part of myself that *wants* the prescription so that I can abuse it for that dopamine rush. But this is the part of me that if it gets control, will completely ruin my entire life and all of my relationships as it's almost managed to do a few times.

I could really use some insight from some like-minded thinkers. I made a post in r/ADHD about this but asking them if I should take speed is like asking r/The_Donald if I should support Trump. What do you guys think about this condition and the treatment so often recommended? What do you think about the over-prescribing of speed to young people? Is it just my perspective that's flawed or is it my intuition trying to tell me to avoid it at all costs? I really don't know anymore.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not trying to offend anyone taking medication for their ADHD. If it works for you, then awesome, give me some insight. But I would ask that you step back from yourself and answer objectively rather than blindly defending it because I want to get to the TRUTH. Is it REALLY helping you or do you think it's doing more harm than good? ",56,2294,10,424,1
2014-03-08 15:18:17,Not all Humans Possess Consciousness,"Consciousness is a metaphysical state. It is depenedent upon having the correct hardware, but simply having the right hardware doesn't create consciousness, it simply makes that hardware capable of consciousness.

Humans, mammals, and many other life-forms possess hardware that make consciousness possible.

Humans are animals. If you work with enough animals you begin to notice that occasionally you come across one that has that glimmer in their eye and a spark in their soul. They feel more alive than the other animals. Somehow this animal has tapped into a higher state of consciousness than the others, probably because it was raised in the correct kind of environment that nurtured its consciousness growth with love.

Humans are animals. Most of them are just as unconscious as livestock. This is not a statement to judge them, this is a statement of observation based on human behavioral patterns. Occasionally a human will come along that has that glimmer in their eye and spark in their soul. 

Consciousness is something you can cultivate and develop. It is not a given simply because you are human. You can lose or diminish your consciousness if you don't continually stretch it. You can enhance your consciousness.

Most humans possess the same level of consciousness that most animals possess. Language and logic do not create consciousness as the super computer Watson is not conscious (though I do believe machine consciousness is possible). Most humans are essentially sophisticated livestock, biologically and psychologically. It is easy for those who have increased their consciousness to fall back down into this state too.

It is the responsibility of the few conscious individuals not just to shepherd the flock for their own benefit, but to raise both the flock's and the shepherds awareness to ever greater heights.",36,1842,5,294,1

2016-01-14 04:15:44,"For Your Consideration, A Few More Thoughts on David Bowie and ""the Occult""","A few days ago I replied to a post on here regarding the possible cosmic significance of David Bowie's death. Basically, I discussed my gut instinct that there is something dark and irrevocably creepy about Bowie. It was met with a lot of responses, positive and negative, so I thought I'd try my hand at explaining myself, in the hopes of generating some civil discussion (and hopefully avoiding the brigading and downvote-censorship that accompanied my last posts).  

My claim was a suspicion that he was an avidya tantrika (which means ‚Äúone who uses intuitional practices for their own selfish gain‚Äù). I also mentioned that occult powers are very real. A lot of the ensuing shitstorm came from a simple misunderstanding of what I meant by ‚Äúoccult powers.‚Äù In the Ananda Marga yoga tradition that I follow, there are 8 occult powers. Only the last 2 of them are what might be commonly and colloquially understood as ‚Äúoccult‚Äù, meaning seemingly magic. And they are quite rare (and of course it's quite natural to be skeptical that such things exist, I certainly am...or at least was). 

The first occult power, however, is the one that I want to focus on. And this is simply that ‚Äúas one thinks, so one becomes.‚Äù In other words, whatever your mind is focused on, is what you will become. The power of Tantra Yoga is precisely that it is a scientific, rational process of learning to focus your mind (through various techniques such as diet, asanas, meditation, etc.). So one who practices Tantra Yoga is a ‚ÄúTantrika‚Äù. Finally, the goal of Tantra Yoga is to follow the path of Vidya (‚Äúlight‚Äù or ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù). 

So a Vidya Tantrika is one who utilizes intuitional practices (those that focus the mind) to dispel ignorance, the primary ignorance being a belief that one is somehow separate from the Universe (or Supreme Consciousness). As we understand through ecology, humanity anatomy, social sciences, etc., we know that the Universe operates as a series of systems, and that these systems can be understood as living organisms of their own. So, to my mind, it makes sense to consider that the Universe itself is a living, sentient being, and that we are part of it, just as we are part of an ecosystem that is a living being, or an individual blood cell is its own being, and also part of a greater being (the human body). So the true purpose of Yoga (which can be defined as ‚Äúunion‚Äù in Sanskrit) is to utilize intuitional practices towards Self-Realization (that realization being that the self is ultimately immersed in the Cosmic Consciousness). 

However, these intuitional practices can also be misutilized towards ones own selfish ends (primarily to satiate the desires of the Ego and the lesser, animal propensities such as a desire for food, sex, power, wealth, fame, etc.). The problem here is not that any of the afformentioned are bad in and of themselves, but they are not able to satisfy our desire for infinite happiness (‚Äúananda‚Äù or ‚Äúbliss‚Äù). Only through realizing the Supreme Consciousness can we meet that desire. The problem comes when we try to meet our infinite desire through finite means (trying to accumulate wealth, power, etc.). As it should be plainly obvious, the world is in the state that it is in currently (collapsing) precisely because our society (capitalist society) and its leaders are obsessed with trying to satiate these desires merely in the physical realm. Try as we might, we cannot use finite resources to satiate an infinite desire. 

So what is an Avidya Tantrika? An Avidya Tantrika is one who follows the path of ignorance with his/her intuitional practices. Such people develop and focus their minds, and discover that they can utilize this new-found talent to satisfy their baser desires. Just as you can learn to focus your mind solely on Parama Purusa (supreme consciousness), so you can focus your mind solely on ‚Äúchasing skirts‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing the greatest basketball player who ever lived‚Äù or whatever else it might be. 

So what's all this got to do with David Bowie? Well, David Bowie was obviously a creative genius. And all creative geniuses have one thing in common, their wellspring of creativity emanates from the Supreme Consciousness. Albert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century said, [""All great achievements of science must start from intuitive knowledge. I believe in intuition and inspiration.... At times I feel certain I am right while not knowing the reason.""](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination)

It's likely that you, dear reader, have experienced this spark of creativity, intuition, or epiphany yourself at some time in your life. For a Tantrika, through intuitional practice, these sparks of creativity can become a steady flame, a steady source. And it would seem that some creative geniuses are Tantrikas whether they know it or not, given that for whatever reason they are better able to tap into this cosmic source. 

So there is no doubt that David Bowie was a genius and that he was able to tap into this. That's why he was able to influence and inspire so many people. But did he uplift them? Was his motivation to uplift and inspire? Or was his motivation to become rich, famous, and wield the power that those things entail? 

Think about it for a second. David Bowie was and is the epitome of glam-rock (which is a fascinating era of rock and roll, aesthetically it's one of my favorites). But what was Glam-rock and what did it represent? If you consider the context, glam-rock came about as the idealism and utopianism of the 1960's gave way to the reckless hedonism and decadence of the 1970's and 80's. To paraphrase from ‚ÄúThe Simpsons‚Äù: they threw out the values but kept all the fun. The 1970's was also the rise of neoliberalism, the last ditch effort by Capitalism to save itself from its own internal contradictions (and which, in our time is beginning to crumble irrevocably). It's no surprise that the top artists of the day were the ones who threw themselves whole-heartedly into this amoral, Thanatos-driven zeitgeist. Gary Glitter, Jimmy Saeville, Jimmy Page, David Bowie, Roman Polanski, all of these prominent cultural figures who contributed to the cultural zeitgeist are also known paedophiles, rapists, and creepers. There are no other words to define adult rock-stars who sleep with 13 year old girls. Given the power differential between a 13 year old girl, and a wealthy, white, grown-up rockstar, the only appropriate word here to describe what happened is ‚Äúrape‚Äù, whether it was physically violent or not (and in the case of Saeville, it often was). 

Furthermore, many of these figures were known to dabble in ‚Äúthe Occult‚Äù, one of the primary characteristics of this movement is an obsession with using ‚Äúsacred symbolism‚Äù to try to influence people. Whether or not such symbolism is real or actually works is beside the point. What matters is that Bowie, and the others, demonstrated an interest in using this symbolism to manipulate people, which in and of itself is inherently coercive. If a person actually wants to sleep with you, you don't have to manipulate them, do you? Whether or not black magic is real, somebody who would attempt to use it to gain power over others (particularly sexual power) is, by definition, a fucking creep. 

My point is, Bowie was a great artist. But he was also driven by his ego, his desire for power, and fame, and fortune.  So Bowie was the epitome of an Avidya Tantrika, one who utilizes their closeness to the cosmic source to serve themselves, and thereby propagate ignorance (in this case, the ignorance of the idea that wealth, fame, and power over others is somehow the key to happiness). 

Finally, one might ask: ‚ÄúWhat's so wrong with seeking fame, fortune, and power over others? He's a rock star after all!‚Äù. The fact that, in capitalist society, a person can be a perverted ego-maniac rapist, and still qualify as a ‚Äúgreat artist‚Äù is precisely my point. The stinking, rotting body of the capitalist system bears testament to the falsehood of the idea that any of the aforementioned things can bring lasting happiness. We're killing ourselves trying to make it work. 

So Bowie was, in my opinion, the personification of the death-throes of a 400 year old, humanity crushing economic system. 

Let's hope that with his death, the perverse zeitgeist of this rotting system goes with him. ",75,8463,13,1408,1

We would become a society of love,apreciattion of the miracle of life and the incredible beauty of the natural world that sustains us.

Instead we are always focusing on negative shit,in a state of fear of dying because of this or that,in the need of the next thing to buy,next thing to accomplish,next relationship to feel loved,next thing to complain about,next vacations,next meal,always in a hurry on the path to our graves.

Always looking outside for answers and sadly a lot of people die without finding the answers.

Psychadelics give us these answers and it's time now to start changing the perception the world has of them,because they are from the earth and make us feel in peace and one with the earth.

They make you feel empathy for nature not wanting to destroy it to grow bigger businesses until there is no more nature to enjoy.

We are psychonauts,we are the revolution to a better world not obsessed with the outter world but with the beautiful inner world that is the source of all experience and source of all hapiness and fullfillment.

So me and my girlfriend are pretty serious right now, we're quite infatuated and in love and all that. We go to uni, and well, lately we've just been having a little tension, and today, she was hungover and was being pretty rude to me because I wouldn't go to the library with her. I wanted to just spend the day tripping and writing my story, but i didn't tell her the tripping part because i knew she'd be mad... We got breakfast and she was being cranky because I wouldn't go to the library to study with her. After a while she accepted it, apologized for being rude, and we went on with our day. We go back to her place, and I go to the bathroom to put the tab on my tongue without her knowing. We're about to go down the elevator, and we're talking, and the fucking tab falls out of my mouth and on to the floor. She goes ""What was that?"" and I try to cover, to lie, out of some fucked up instinct. I try to tell her it was a mint, but she knew I was lying so I came clean.

She didn't like that I would do drugs, she was fine with it just as long as i kept it away from her.

But now i've disrespected that trust, I've disrespected her, our relationship... I fucked up big time. She said we would stay together but fuck psychonauts... I don't know if this wound can be healed.

I know that whatever happens life will go on, but fuck. I'm so mad at myself, and I'm probably about to have the worst trip of my life. How could I do that to her y'know? Why did I do this to myself? I just wasn't thinking.

2016-04-20 09:18:17,Just putting this out there - who else senses a major disaster is imminent?,"Since June last year, I have felt absurdly confident that a major, global disaster will occur by March 2017. Of course, people make claims like these all the time. I'm speaking first from intuition, from a general growing sense of dread about the state of the world.

Around November last year, having done some research, I settled on the global catastrophe being the next (iteration of the) Global Financial Crisis that began in 2007. If my findings are correct, this crash will almost certainly be even worse.

I'm curious if anyone else has had a similar feeling. I am testing my own predictions against the reality to see how on the pulse I am. I have had striking moments of intuition before where I felt similarly confident, but never on this scale.

2017-04-29 15:32:30,Drove through traffic stop on 3 hits of acid,"My buddy and I decided to skate around the beach last night.  We stopped at the skatepark to see my cousin.  My friend was there and conviently had acid.  So naturally we take three hits with out question on the spot.  

We skate around for a bit before we peak.  He ended up struggling with it but I felt right at home.  He had to call a girl to come get him, leaving me in a parking garage  a few hours into the trip, wtf.  

I left his wallet in his car.  I had a maybe 5 min drive to get it , I can do it I can do it I've drove before.  I'm a ""professional‚Äã"".  

  When I went to go meet him I ran into a police traffic stop.  There was 20-30 cars alone and cops just lined up watching me pull in. There was a stop sign so I stopped and a cop told me to pull up to the car.  Nobody came to check me or talk to me so I said ""hey"" to the cop right by my car window.  

Now here I am driving without my license, my license is suspended btw, I am on 300`~mcg, and I was convinced I was done.  My exit plan was to tell him I was on acid and reach for his gun to basically commit suicide.  I was going to do everything I could for him to just shoot me dead because there would be no way I could go to jail that long.  

I looked him in the eyes and sent him all the energy I could muster.  I sent him my soul.  The universe was definitely watching out for me that day or that man was Jesus walking among us because he knew I was tripping balls.  

He asked if I had anything to drink loudly.  I said no sir in the weakest, trembling voice I didn't even recognize.  It sounded pathetic honestly.  He asked for my license and registration.  I explained that I was meeting my friend for my wallet and I'm just trying to go home.  He said to drive safe.  

I was slurring my words, I sounded fucked up, I could barely string a sentence together, English wasn't making sense, this dude's face was swirling, I'm surrounded by blue.  Fuck no.  

That shit made me realize something.  What the FUCK am I doing with my life.  

You know why the hippie age in the 60s ended?  Because they fucking grew up.  Everything they stood for they turned their back on and conformed to society.  I HATE to say this but I am done smoking, I am done tripping, I need to get my shit together.  I've had more acid trip then I can count.  Doing all this shit has made my IQ plummet.  But it's helped me out all so much.  God I hate this shit.  It's like the universe is calling me to this spiritual path of non material and love and my head says I need to go back to school and focus on a career.  GOD I HATE THIS.  Why can't I just fucking exist without needing to bust my fucking ass working two jobs destroying my body doing manual labor and melting my mind at night working at a restaurant?   I guess the other option is being a slave to debt and probably ending back ip as a landscaper.  I am at a total loss as to what to do.  The signs tell me not to ""grow up"" but honestly I want to just have a little stability.   I'm young but ive had an extremely rough life.  I'vr never had the slightest desire to have money of any kind at any age.  I never asked for stuff as a kid.  I was always just wondering around outside.  And why can't I do that now?   If I could I would walk till I drop.  I feel like I'm going no where my staying in the same ghetto shitty city.  

Alls I know is that this life is a fucking trip on its own.  I don't know where the fuck I am going at any point and that's getting a little scary now that I'm getting older.  What to do what to do hmmm....",44,3551,9,714,1
2022-02-20 07:28:46,Psychedelics won't save you from manipulation and predation,"My ex tried to get me into harder drugs by introducing me to psychedelics. He pretended that he was helping me with ""depression"". Yet his true colors showed in the end.

He was trying to brainwash me. I don't doubt that psychedelics have therapeutic properties. I have trauma because of him and he made me more vulnerable because of this trust that he exploited.

You can think that someone has good intentions, sending you studies and material about the good that drugs can do, but at the end of the day, they don't care about your experience at all. They don't care about what good it's actually doing for you.

It makes me sick knowing that this very thing is a genre of porn. That this is the type of thing that predators will use, in the name of science, to exploit some good that could have actually been done.

EDIT: I think a lot of people missed that this post was more about who you are taking drugs with and why and what the effect of that is. Even a good tool can be used in a bad way. Just because you have taken these substances doesn't mean they will save you from anything already existing in your head or in your environment. When you have exposure to a negative dynamic in your environment over a long period of time, your vulnerabilities are more exposed. It is the routine exploitation of some of those vulnerabilities that will do it. 

Edit 2: Still not surprised that many people here have missed the point entirely and gaslit/taken it out on me. The ad hominems reflect more on the commenter. I'm just calling it like I see it. If you have problems before taking the drugs, the drugs won't cure the problem. At most, they can treat the problem temporarily or make it worse.

I have spent most of my life obsessed with the gap between what the world is and what I want it to be.

I suppose everyone is obsessed with this, actually.

In my case, I want the world to be a utopia wherein there is no workday, and typical transactions are not sales, thefts, and punishments, but givings.

In order to try to help contribute to steering the world in this direction (I believe that every person contributes her own share in helping to steer the world), I have steered my own life in directions that has led to me acquiring knowledge about the gap between reality and the utopia.

Now, I have written much about an imaginary utopia that exists in my mind. I also have written imaginary things that people living in this utopia say to each other as they interact with each other. They actually interact in a language I'm designing called Mnemonese, but I ususually write down what they say in English, because (a) the Mnemonese language is still too unstable for written to remain readable, and (b) English is easier to communicate to other people. ~~I'll type some of them in now, as I read off of the wall behind my computer monitor.~~ Never mind, I can't type them in easily, because there are very many valid reading orders. [Here is a picture of some of them.](http://i.imgur.com/TasWUfO.jpg)

The Mnemonites are a very honest people. These English versions may look rather strange or ambiguous, but the Mnemonese meanings are more specific. This is because the Mnemonese versions of, for example, anti-fuck, have morphologies that reveal their intended meanings. I will try using the fourth phonomorphology to derive the word anti-fuck now. It is a thing done in cold, so it should have the root ***oo***, for **cold, patterned, stable, absorbing things**. (Fucking, on the other hand, would have the root ***ee***, for **hot, chaotic, unstable, radiant things**.) Next, since anti-fucking is painful, we will pick the root ***z***, which can mean ***tear/split***, or **pain**. The result is ***zee***, **anti-fuck**. (**Fucking** is ***lee***^(**1**). (Can you guess what the root ***l*** means?^(**2**)))

Anyway, back to the main purpose of this post: how to help steer the world toward states that are more utopia-like.

Having been actively working and playing in this thought experiment for about a solid year now, I have seen very clearly several root causes of our present human suffering.

One interesting root cause is money. The Mnemonese word for money translates to *imaginary energy*. The value of money is artificial, while the value of energy is enforced by nature. When we trade using money, we have different motivaitons than when we trade using energy. Using the ~~terminology~~ analogy of game theory, we could say that money imposes an artificial change in the scores and penalties of the game that is life. In other words, money changes the value of things, and therefore changes the values of our choices that involve those things.

In changing the way that we value our choices, our very emotions are changed to match these new values.^(**3**) This results in a struggle in the mind; reality pulls us to feel one way, whilst money pulls us to feel somehow else. This struggle causes us to suffer. There are other struggles that also cause us to suffer, but I think this one is one of the biggest ones, and one that separates the human race from other animals.

More particularly, money is used to create artificial high-scarcity for many, and artificial low-scarcity for few. The problem is two-fold: first, money is artificially scarce for everyone, and second, the unbalanced distribution of scarcity causes an unbalanced distribution of emotions. When the distribution of emotional belief states is different, ease of love and understanding break down, and peace becomes a less stable state of existence, and war, a more stable state.

**TL;DR** Money is not real, and using it as if it is causes anxiety.

Edit:

Another great problem, another root cause of suffering, is that our calendar system is in disharmony with the earth's own calendar. As it times our lives, it creates a great caucauphony.

---

**Footnotes**

**1.** ***lee***, *fuck*, is also a homonym of *collide*, in the present version of Mnemonese.

**2.** It can mean come-together, or pleasure.

**3.** You may perhaps see evidence of our emotions in many places. One piece of evidence I see is that the emotional values of the workplace are different from those at home. Most people undergo some kind of change of face when they enter and leave places where they have to talk about, handle, or work for, money, which results in people behaving particularly anally in the workplace, while not so much once they are home with their family.

**4.** I also have a ~~dystopian~~ Douglas Adams-esc thought experiment, which is inspired mostly from reality. In it, most people don't think clearly most of the time, and the drugs that are most effective at restoring the mind to a state capable of thinking clearly, are taboo to use or speak of using. In order to be able to wake up enough to make a stream of insightful posts this evening, I spent an entire day waking myself up, first with a long cold shower, then with yoga, martial arts, jogging, dancing, and talking.

Obviously it isn't as simple as eat some before breakfast, as it could potentially be bad if taken to regularly; however if this were diluted into a lotion and rubbed on the neck near the carotid artery and the rest of the blood supply in the neck it could cross the blood brain barrier and decalcify the pineal gland. If taken once a month (as to be frequent enough to have an effect on the brain without making yourself anemic) it would reverse, or at least slow down, the calcification of the pineal gland.
